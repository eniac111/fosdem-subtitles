1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.680
You're going to talk about cluster API operating Kubernetes with Kubernetes.

2
0:00:10.680 --> 0:00:11.680
How?

3
0:00:11.680 --> 0:00:12.680
Hello.

4
0:00:12.680 --> 0:00:14.120
Thank you for coming.

5
0:00:14.120 --> 0:00:15.120
My name is Alex.

6
0:00:15.120 --> 0:00:16.560
I'm a software engineer.

7
0:00:16.560 --> 0:00:18.900
I work at Suzy on the run chair.

8
0:00:18.900 --> 0:00:23.160
I do a lot of stuff related to cluster lifecycle.

9
0:00:23.160 --> 0:00:30.200
And today I'm going to talk about cluster API and operating Kubernetes with Kubernetes.

10
0:00:30.200 --> 0:00:31.720
Hope it will be fun.

11
0:00:31.720 --> 0:00:36.320
Here is a short summary of what we are going to talk about today.

12
0:00:36.320 --> 0:00:43.120
I'll try to explain the problem of managing the Kubernetes cluster lifecycle.

13
0:00:43.120 --> 0:00:48.880
I'll try to explain what is cluster API, how does it approach this problem.

14
0:00:48.880 --> 0:00:52.960
And we'll take a look at some building blocks of cluster API.

15
0:00:52.960 --> 0:00:55.440
And also I'll be doing a demo.

16
0:00:55.440 --> 0:01:00.120
And because I don't have enough time, the demo will be done simultaneously with the

17
0:01:00.120 --> 0:01:01.120
talk.

18
0:01:01.120 --> 0:01:02.720
So it's a live demo.

19
0:01:02.720 --> 0:01:03.720
Nothing is recorded.

20
0:01:03.720 --> 0:01:05.720
Hopefully everything will be fine.

21
0:01:05.720 --> 0:01:08.160
I already had some problems with networking today.

22
0:01:08.160 --> 0:01:11.560
But let's see.

23
0:01:11.560 --> 0:01:14.560
So let's move on to the next slide.

24
0:01:14.560 --> 0:01:19.120
So cluster lifecycle is complicated and why is that?

25
0:01:19.120 --> 0:01:23.960
What if you have to manage more than one cluster, say you have 10 Kubernetes cluster or maybe

26
0:01:23.960 --> 0:01:31.240
100 Kubernetes clusters, then the problem becomes similar to managing containers and

27
0:01:31.240 --> 0:01:34.160
why we invented Kubernetes.

28
0:01:34.160 --> 0:01:43.720
And cluster API tries to solve like this problem of managing multiple clusters and

29
0:01:43.720 --> 0:01:50.680
also sometimes you have to manage the underlying infrastructure and that also somehow needs

30
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:54.360
to be done in a nice and consistent way.

31
0:01:54.360 --> 0:01:56.400
Then you also have to upgrade clusters.

32
0:01:56.400 --> 0:02:01.040
Sometimes you have to upgrade multiple clusters and upgrading clusters is not always easy,

33
0:02:01.040 --> 0:02:04.120
especially when it comes to control planes.

34
0:02:04.120 --> 0:02:08.000
And you want to deploy your clusters on different infrastructure.

35
0:02:08.000 --> 0:02:10.680
Let's say you have something running on AWS.

36
0:02:10.680 --> 0:02:16.520
Then you have some bare metal things running and you also need to somehow manage that.

37
0:02:16.520 --> 0:02:20.480
And you don't want to use different tools that depend on your infrastructure.

38
0:02:20.480 --> 0:02:25.080
You want to use something that is a single point of management and is consistent.

39
0:02:25.080 --> 0:02:31.920
It provides some nice experience and it's easy to use and automate.

40
0:02:31.920 --> 0:02:33.640
So what is cluster API?

41
0:02:33.640 --> 0:02:42.520
Cluster API takes this approach where we install it, it's an extension to Kubernetes API that

42
0:02:42.520 --> 0:02:48.920
allows you to provision, upgrade and operate your cluster and you install it on Kubernetes.

43
0:02:48.920 --> 0:02:54.440
Then you use what we call management cluster to manage workload clusters.

44
0:02:54.440 --> 0:02:57.520
I guess you can do this on different infrastructure provider.

45
0:02:57.520 --> 0:03:03.200
You can have one management cluster managing stuff running on AWS when you can have the

46
0:03:03.200 --> 0:03:07.560
same cluster managing your clusters on Azure.

47
0:03:07.560 --> 0:03:12.320
So this is the basic idea of cluster API.

48
0:03:12.320 --> 0:03:21.400
And next we are going to take a look at the building blocks of KPI and I will start my

49
0:03:21.400 --> 0:03:22.400
demo.

50
0:03:22.400 --> 0:03:29.440
But before this, let me switch to the terminal and show you what I have prepared in advance.

51
0:03:29.440 --> 0:03:38.120
So I deployed a management cluster where I already installed KPI so we don't lose time.

52
0:03:38.120 --> 0:03:40.560
Everything should be up and running.

53
0:03:40.560 --> 0:03:44.520
And yeah, let's move on.

54
0:03:44.520 --> 0:03:50.280
The main entity in the cluster API is called cluster and it represents a Kubernetes cluster.

55
0:03:50.280 --> 0:03:52.680
It's not tied to some kind infrastructure.

56
0:03:52.680 --> 0:03:55.880
So it's just a generic Kubernetes cluster.

57
0:03:55.880 --> 0:04:02.960
And to make it more clear, I will show you how it looks like.

58
0:04:02.960 --> 0:04:08.200
As you can see, it's a normal Kubernetes object that has some kind metadata.

59
0:04:08.200 --> 0:04:11.880
But what's interesting for us is the spec here.

60
0:04:11.880 --> 0:04:16.200
You can see the spec references to things.

61
0:04:16.200 --> 0:04:17.200
Yeah.

62
0:04:17.200 --> 0:04:23.440
The first reference is a reference to infrastructure.

63
0:04:23.440 --> 0:04:27.480
For this demo, I'm going to use Docker as infrastructure provider because I don't want

64
0:04:27.480 --> 0:04:33.120
to make any requests to some cloud because of a network.

65
0:04:33.120 --> 0:04:35.920
I wasn't sure if it's going to work properly.

66
0:04:35.920 --> 0:04:39.920
So I decided to use Docker as our infrastructure provider.

67
0:04:39.920 --> 0:04:43.720
It's an infrastructure provider we use for development and testing.

68
0:04:43.720 --> 0:04:49.840
And the second interesting reference is a reference to what we call control pane providers.

69
0:04:49.840 --> 0:04:55.560
And because control planes are harder to manage than worker machines, we require a specific

70
0:04:55.560 --> 0:04:57.000
resource for that.

71
0:04:57.000 --> 0:05:01.800
And this control pane provider is based on a tool called Qt-QPADM, which is a default

72
0:05:01.800 --> 0:05:04.680
that you can use with KAPI.

73
0:05:04.680 --> 0:05:12.440
So let me create this cluster and we can take a look at the objects that are referenced

74
0:05:12.440 --> 0:05:13.640
inside.

75
0:05:13.640 --> 0:05:20.600
The first reference you saw is a reference to Docker cluster.

76
0:05:20.600 --> 0:05:23.880
It's also what we call an infrastructure cluster.

77
0:05:23.880 --> 0:05:30.880
And it's responsible for all prerequisites that are required to run your cluster on any

78
0:05:30.880 --> 0:05:31.880
infrastructure.

79
0:05:31.880 --> 0:05:36.880
So, for example, if you're running it on public cloud, it will provision all networks, load

80
0:05:36.880 --> 0:05:41.760
balancer, security groups, VPCs, and whatever else you need.

81
0:05:41.760 --> 0:05:49.240
And this is like this reference is actually what makes cluster API plugable.

82
0:05:49.240 --> 0:05:53.880
So if you want to add your own provider, you just have to follow a documentation implement

83
0:05:53.880 --> 0:05:57.160
API with some rules and then you can reference it.

84
0:05:57.160 --> 0:06:01.720
And that's how you plug in your own provider.

85
0:06:01.720 --> 0:06:05.160
Let me show you how Docker cluster looks in our case.

86
0:06:05.160 --> 0:06:06.160
It's pretty simple.

87
0:06:06.160 --> 0:06:08.520
There is no real infrastructure to run.

88
0:06:08.520 --> 0:06:12.720
So I'm going to create it too.

89
0:06:12.720 --> 0:06:18.440
Okay, that's done.

90
0:06:18.440 --> 0:06:23.440
Then the next reference we saw in cluster object was a reference to what we call a control

91
0:06:23.440 --> 0:06:25.360
pane provider.

92
0:06:25.360 --> 0:06:32.120
What it does, it creates a control pane machine, generates cloud config, and also is responsible

93
0:06:32.120 --> 0:06:36.400
for any other actions related to control pane management.

94
0:06:36.400 --> 0:06:43.520
Not like, you know, at CD, Core DNS, or whatever you implement or want to enable.

95
0:06:43.520 --> 0:06:44.760
Let me show you how it looks like.

96
0:06:44.760 --> 0:06:50.240
This will be so far the biggest object we have there because it contains some configurations

97
0:06:50.240 --> 0:06:53.280
we require for our control pane.

98
0:06:53.280 --> 0:07:00.280
But as you can see, you can customize some Kubernetes components there using Kubernetes

99
0:07:00.280 --> 0:07:01.280
API.

100
0:07:01.280 --> 0:07:07.720
If you can just specify anything you need here to provision control planes, you can

101
0:07:07.720 --> 0:07:19.320
also specify a replica set, and you also need Kubernetes version there.

102
0:07:19.320 --> 0:07:27.320
Now maybe I forgot to create it.

103
0:07:27.320 --> 0:07:33.200
Yeah.

104
0:07:33.200 --> 0:07:34.520
Okay.

105
0:07:34.520 --> 0:07:40.040
So let's talk about worker machines and how does KP approach managing machines.

106
0:07:40.040 --> 0:07:47.680
It's important first to note that machine is just a host for your Kubernetes nodes.

107
0:07:47.680 --> 0:07:52.040
So it can be virtual machine, can be bare metal, can be anything your infrastructure

108
0:07:52.040 --> 0:07:54.120
provider means.

109
0:07:54.120 --> 0:07:58.200
And I'd like to show an example with bots.

110
0:07:58.200 --> 0:08:01.200
You don't manage bots manually, right?

111
0:08:01.200 --> 0:08:03.000
You don't use them as a standalone resource.

112
0:08:03.000 --> 0:08:05.320
You use something else.

113
0:08:05.320 --> 0:08:09.560
If you want to manage replicas count for your bots, you use something called replica set

114
0:08:09.560 --> 0:08:14.320
that has just one purpose, create your certain count of bots.

115
0:08:14.320 --> 0:08:18.280
And then if you want to do more complex stuff like rolling upgrades, you use a deployment

116
0:08:18.280 --> 0:08:20.880
on top of this that manages replica sets.

117
0:08:20.880 --> 0:08:24.400
So KP followed the same pattern and created machines.

118
0:08:24.400 --> 0:08:27.920
Then there is the machine set that manages replica count.

119
0:08:27.920 --> 0:08:34.440
And there is the machine deployment on top of that that does more complicated things.

120
0:08:34.440 --> 0:08:38.320
Let's go back to the terminal.

121
0:08:38.320 --> 0:08:44.040
I will show you the machine deployment.

122
0:08:44.040 --> 0:08:46.600
You can see it's similar to normal deployment.

123
0:08:46.600 --> 0:08:52.040
It has replica count, then it has a selector, has a template.

124
0:08:52.040 --> 0:08:55.840
And inside the spec, it's similar to what we saw with cluster object.

125
0:08:55.840 --> 0:08:57.680
It has two references.

126
0:08:57.680 --> 0:09:03.760
One is for our infrastructure template, which is Docker for this demo.

127
0:09:03.760 --> 0:09:24.040
And the second one is a bootstrap provider, which is based on Kube-ADM.

128
0:09:24.040 --> 0:09:30.000
So the infrastructure template or Docker template that we saw there in the reference are just

129
0:09:30.000 --> 0:09:33.880
specifications for your host depending on your cloud provider.

130
0:09:33.880 --> 0:09:38.800
It can be an instance type, storage size, anything you put there.

131
0:09:38.800 --> 0:09:45.280
And the second reference to bootstrap provider is just a reference to an API that generates

132
0:09:45.280 --> 0:09:51.200
user data with proper cloud config so you can configure your Kubernetes components as

133
0:09:51.200 --> 0:09:52.200
you want.

134
0:09:52.200 --> 0:09:55.360
Let me show you how it looks like.

135
0:09:55.360 --> 0:10:01.240
For Docker machine, it's just an image in this case and some extra mounts.

136
0:10:01.240 --> 0:10:08.800
And for bootstrap provider, we just have some arguments for our Kubernetes components.

137
0:10:08.800 --> 0:10:15.040
This is it.

138
0:10:15.040 --> 0:10:26.240
Okay, so this was it.

139
0:10:26.240 --> 0:10:30.760
Let me now check if everything works fine.

140
0:10:30.760 --> 0:10:33.520
Yeah, everything works fine.

141
0:10:33.520 --> 0:10:39.640
As you can see, we have free control pane machines that are running inside Docker containers

142
0:10:39.640 --> 0:10:41.240
that we created before.

143
0:10:41.240 --> 0:10:48.760
And after some time, we should get a worker machine that we just created.

144
0:10:48.760 --> 0:10:54.640
Let's take a look at how it all works together.

145
0:10:54.640 --> 0:11:01.960
We have a cluster object that represents the cluster then it has to reference an infrastructure

146
0:11:01.960 --> 0:11:04.480
provider, which is Docker in this case.

147
0:11:04.480 --> 0:11:10.400
And it also has to reference a control pane provider, which is based on Kube-ADM.

148
0:11:10.400 --> 0:11:16.440
And once these two are done with our job, you can connect your machine deployments that

149
0:11:16.440 --> 0:11:23.240
have to reference a machine template so Kube knows what host specifications you want and

150
0:11:23.240 --> 0:11:30.920
also a Kube-ADM template where you can configure Kubernetes components.

151
0:11:30.920 --> 0:11:40.800
And this is all you need to create a basic Kube cluster.

152
0:11:40.800 --> 0:11:47.080
Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to talk about other things that exist in Kube

153
0:11:47.080 --> 0:11:53.240
like machine health checks that help you track and remediate unhealthy machines when there

154
0:11:53.240 --> 0:11:58.520
are cluster classes, which are powerful templates for creating clusters.

155
0:11:58.520 --> 0:12:01.360
You can also connect cluster autoscalar if you want.

156
0:12:01.360 --> 0:12:06.920
And there are day two operations coming, so you can think of KP is like Swiss knife for

157
0:12:06.920 --> 0:12:13.720
everything related to cluster lifecycle.

158
0:12:13.720 --> 0:12:17.160
And we still have time.

159
0:12:17.160 --> 0:12:21.600
I'm going to show you how we can upgrade the cluster.

160
0:12:21.600 --> 0:12:24.520
Let's check its state again.

161
0:12:24.520 --> 0:12:25.520
Yeah.

162
0:12:25.520 --> 0:12:34.480
So if you can see that we have three control planes and they all are running Kubernetes

163
0:12:34.480 --> 0:12:39.600
V125.

164
0:12:39.600 --> 0:12:42.880
And let me upgrade them to Kubernetes V126.

165
0:12:42.880 --> 0:12:44.720
So how do I do this?

166
0:12:44.720 --> 0:12:52.480
In order to do this, we have to change the version in the control pane provider object

167
0:12:52.480 --> 0:12:56.920
and we also have to change the image reference in the machine template.

168
0:12:56.920 --> 0:13:10.520
So just by doing so, I will start upgrading the cluster.

169
0:13:10.520 --> 0:13:17.000
As you can see, cluster API started to spin up new control pane machine with V126 that

170
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:22.360
is going to eventually replace old ones and is going to take care of for us like in

171
0:13:22.360 --> 0:13:24.960
ensuring that CD quorum and all sorts of things.

172
0:13:24.960 --> 0:13:36.040
So we don't have to take care about this.

173
0:13:36.040 --> 0:13:45.840
I'm going to go back to the summary and let's go once again for what we saw today.

174
0:13:45.840 --> 0:13:51.080
So I tried to explain the problem of managing Kubernetes clusters and the main idea, we

175
0:13:51.080 --> 0:13:57.920
wanted to have a tool that provides a declarative and consistent API and will allow you provision

176
0:13:57.920 --> 0:14:03.640
and manage your clusters on different infrastructure in some nice way so you can have a single

177
0:14:03.640 --> 0:14:10.800
point of managing your clusters for all possible infrastructures you are running.

178
0:14:10.800 --> 0:14:17.760
And this approach is like use Kubernetes because Kubernetes already provides a lot

179
0:14:17.760 --> 0:14:25.600
of tools for building a powerful API.

180
0:14:25.600 --> 0:14:31.120
I think with us it maybe was a bit quick but I don't have anything else.

181
0:14:31.120 --> 0:14:35.640
I'm ready to answer questions if someone has.

182
0:14:35.640 --> 0:14:50.320
We have ample time for questions.

183
0:14:50.320 --> 0:14:53.200
This allows you to manage the workload clusters.

184
0:14:53.200 --> 0:14:56.800
Can it also manage the life cycle of the management cluster?

185
0:14:56.800 --> 0:14:58.120
Yes, you can.

186
0:14:58.120 --> 0:14:59.560
So what if it destroys itself?

187
0:14:59.560 --> 0:15:00.560
So what happens then?

188
0:15:00.560 --> 0:15:01.560
It shouldn't.

189
0:15:01.560 --> 0:15:03.640
It depends on how you use it.

190
0:15:03.640 --> 0:15:04.640
Works on local host.

191
0:15:04.640 --> 0:15:11.400
You can manage management clusters.

192
0:15:11.400 --> 0:15:12.400
Thank you.

193
0:15:12.400 --> 0:15:16.880
The question about updates, is it possible to update components like cobalates without

194
0:15:16.880 --> 0:15:18.880
recreating virtual machines?

195
0:15:18.880 --> 0:15:20.800
And how is it working?

196
0:15:20.800 --> 0:15:26.960
It's done through your bootstrap or control pane provider.

197
0:15:26.960 --> 0:15:32.720
And you also have to provide an image that will be used for your new instances.

198
0:15:32.720 --> 0:15:39.240
No, no, I mean if you need to update cobalates and you don't want to reorder new.

199
0:15:39.240 --> 0:15:41.600
Cost API doesn't support in place upgrades.

200
0:15:41.600 --> 0:15:46.440
It will create a new machine with new image, new everything and then replace an old one.

201
0:15:46.440 --> 0:15:47.600
Okay, got it.

202
0:15:47.600 --> 0:15:52.080
And can you tell a little more about control pane updates?

203
0:15:52.080 --> 0:15:53.080
Control pane updates.

204
0:15:53.080 --> 0:15:56.120
Updates of control pane nodes and components.

205
0:15:56.120 --> 0:15:57.400
I just showed one.

206
0:15:57.400 --> 0:16:02.840
When you change the version, it will start replacing old machines with newer ones.

207
0:16:02.840 --> 0:16:05.080
You just have to provide all the specifications.

208
0:16:05.080 --> 0:16:09.080
You have to provide the new Kubernetes version you want and also new image.

209
0:16:09.080 --> 0:16:14.600
So we try to bake everything inside the machine image so you don't have to download new things

210
0:16:14.600 --> 0:16:19.080
and it will just replace old machine with a new one with new versions.

211
0:16:19.080 --> 0:16:21.040
So it's a replace upgrade.

212
0:16:21.040 --> 0:16:24.400
It's not in place.

213
0:16:24.400 --> 0:16:29.400
The same as POTS, if you change, for example, reference to image, it will destroy old one

214
0:16:29.400 --> 0:16:30.720
and create a newer.

215
0:16:30.720 --> 0:16:34.040
So it's the same concept.

216
0:16:34.040 --> 0:16:36.600
There's an online question is in the chat.

217
0:16:36.600 --> 0:16:42.760
Are there any latency requirements between the management cluster and the workload cluster?

218
0:16:42.760 --> 0:16:51.600
It depends on your use case, but yeah, ideally you should take care of it like with your management

219
0:16:51.600 --> 0:17:06.880
cluster with somewhere near workload clusters or is able to reach it within some limits.

220
0:17:06.880 --> 0:17:08.120
And one more.

221
0:17:08.120 --> 0:17:13.400
Does the management cluster need to run at all the time or can it be shut off when not

222
0:17:13.400 --> 0:17:15.800
doing life cycle work?

223
0:17:15.800 --> 0:17:18.200
So here is the thing.

224
0:17:18.200 --> 0:17:24.240
If you disable it, nothing will manage your cluster so they will be basically unmanaged.

225
0:17:24.240 --> 0:17:28.640
Your workload cluster will continue running, but there is nothing that will keep track

226
0:17:28.640 --> 0:17:29.640
of them.

227
0:17:29.640 --> 0:17:33.280
For example, if you use cluster autoscaler or machine health checks, you need your management

228
0:17:33.280 --> 0:17:37.440
cluster to be running all the time because it constantly looks at the state of your workload

229
0:17:37.440 --> 0:17:40.440
clusters.

230
0:17:40.440 --> 0:17:48.600
Okay, if there are no more questions and we can end a few minutes early, thank you for

231
0:17:48.600 --> 0:17:49.600
the talk.

232
0:17:49.600 --> 0:17:50.600
Thank you all for attending.

233
0:17:50.600 --> 0:17:51.600
Thank you.

234
0:17:51.600 --> 0:17:52.600
Thank you.

235
0:17:52.600 --> 0:17:53.600
Thank you.

236
0:17:53.600 --> 0:17:54.600
Thank you.

237
0:17:54.600 --> 0:17:55.600
Thank you.

238
0:17:55.600 --> 0:18:11.600
Thank you.
