0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:15.780
After two years of... for them at home. This is our first in-persona for them, so welcome.

2
0:00:15.780 --> 0:00:25.080
So just to remember you... oh, where is the mouse? Okay. Just... oh, back. Okay, just

3
0:00:25.080 --> 0:00:33.660
a few rules. You're not in your room anymore, so please keep all the rubbish on the trash

4
0:00:33.660 --> 0:00:41.560
bin and just try to leave the room clean. There's rules about no food and no drinks,

5
0:00:41.560 --> 0:00:50.520
or just... it's fine if you drink, but try not to bring your food with you in the room.

6
0:00:50.520 --> 0:01:01.960
That's all. And so the post-COVID rule, so masks are not mandatory for the folks, but

7
0:01:01.960 --> 0:01:10.560
we don't correct the use. If you want to use one, just feel free. And we try to ventilate

8
0:01:10.560 --> 0:01:20.200
the room after each talk. So maybe if people in the back could help us, because we have

9
0:01:20.200 --> 0:01:28.040
five minutes to switch from one speaker to the other, so feel free to help us. So aside

10
0:01:28.040 --> 0:01:39.800
from that, this is the schedule for this morning. Yeah, we'll be the first speaker this morning

11
0:01:39.800 --> 0:01:53.600
about BSD drivers, and we'll finish with the Kimura Linux, the last I'll finish at 2pm.

12
0:01:53.600 --> 0:02:11.400
So that's mostly all. Thank you very much for being here, and enjoy your frozen.
