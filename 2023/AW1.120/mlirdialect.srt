1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.520
Yeah, I hope you had a great Fostem so far.

2
0:00:10.520 --> 0:00:14.440
I'm happy to talk about how to build your own MLIR dialect.

3
0:00:14.440 --> 0:00:20.060
So just as a first question, who is aware of what MLIR actually is?

4
0:00:20.060 --> 0:00:22.680
Who have heard of the MLIR subproject?

5
0:00:22.680 --> 0:00:24.480
Awesome.

6
0:00:24.480 --> 0:00:29.240
So it's not the whole audience, so I'm going to talk a little bit more about what MLIR

7
0:00:29.240 --> 0:00:30.240
is.

8
0:00:30.240 --> 0:00:37.440
So my outline is, yeah, what is MLIR actually, but I only have a really short slide on that.

9
0:00:37.440 --> 0:00:44.440
I will show you the standalone example which exists in the MLIR or in the LLVM repository

10
0:00:44.440 --> 0:00:46.880
as part of the MLIR project.

11
0:00:46.880 --> 0:00:52.020
And I will tell you a little bit more about how you can extend it, how you can build your

12
0:00:52.020 --> 0:00:57.520
own dialect, because following the discussions on discourse and discord, it always seems

13
0:00:57.520 --> 0:01:04.140
like people hitting the same pain points, at least we did several times.

14
0:01:04.140 --> 0:01:10.340
So that's why I set up this kind of tutorial to show you some of the tricks behind, mainly

15
0:01:10.340 --> 0:01:14.920
from the CMake perspective, which is some kind of tricky sometimes.

16
0:01:14.920 --> 0:01:20.060
So beside that, how to build it, I show you how you can combine it with other dialects.

17
0:01:20.060 --> 0:01:28.560
And last but not least, how to extend your dialect with types or attributes.

18
0:01:28.560 --> 0:01:33.200
And just as a side note, all code snippets are, of course, licensed under Apache 2 with

19
0:01:33.200 --> 0:01:35.440
LLVM exceptions.

20
0:01:35.440 --> 0:01:36.440
So what is MLIR?

21
0:01:36.440 --> 0:01:46.760
MLIR is actually a reusable compiler infrastructure that was introduced by Google in 2019, early

22
0:01:46.760 --> 0:01:53.520
2019, and at the end of 2019, Google donated it to the LLVM Foundation, so it's officially

23
0:01:53.520 --> 0:02:02.240
part of the LLVM project, and there it lives in the main, in the monorepo MLIR.

24
0:02:02.240 --> 0:02:09.160
And what it allows you is to define operations, attributes, and types which are grouped in

25
0:02:09.160 --> 0:02:14.280
so-called dialects, and that lets you define your own intermediate representation.

26
0:02:14.280 --> 0:02:19.720
Later on in the session, we will also have an update about the flank compiler, which

27
0:02:19.720 --> 0:02:25.520
also uses MLIR to define its own intermediate representation.

28
0:02:25.520 --> 0:02:31.880
And these dialects can be part either of MLIR core, meaning they are in upstream, like the

29
0:02:31.880 --> 0:02:36.920
funk dialect, which gives you the ability to define what a function is, or there's also

30
0:02:36.920 --> 0:02:45.000
an LLVM IR dialect, which actually mirrors what LLVM IR is, but it is modeled in MLIR

31
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:49.240
– sorry, what LLVM IR is, but it is modeled in MLIR.

32
0:02:49.240 --> 0:02:55.400
There are tons of other dialects, like a GPU dialect, a TOSR dialect, which is the Tensor

33
0:02:55.400 --> 0:03:01.560
Operate Set Architecture, or a MTC, which I am one of the developers behind.

34
0:03:01.560 --> 0:03:07.960
There are also many, many out-of-tree dialects, like the SOC project is using it, or Torch

35
0:03:07.960 --> 0:03:14.240
MLIR, which is actually modeling PyTorch in MLIR, many, many more, and these are considered

36
0:03:14.240 --> 0:03:16.400
as out-of-tree.

37
0:03:16.400 --> 0:03:22.080
So when we look at the standalone example, which is really a brilliant starter when you

38
0:03:22.080 --> 0:03:30.040
want to create your own dialect, you find it as part of the LLVM MonoRepository, and

39
0:03:30.040 --> 0:03:38.600
you can just build it against an installed LLVM, you can just run CMake, configure it

40
0:03:38.600 --> 0:03:45.880
accordingly, you just need a path where you find your installed MLIR and where the LLVM

41
0:03:45.880 --> 0:03:53.080
external lit is present, and actually then you can just build your target, which is here

42
0:03:53.080 --> 0:03:57.880
– check standalone, it builds all the tools, and further runs some tests.

43
0:03:57.880 --> 0:04:03.040
This actually assumes, as I have mentioned, that LLVM and MLIR are built here and built

44
0:04:03.040 --> 0:04:06.280
here, and then they are installed to prefix.

45
0:04:06.280 --> 0:04:15.640
And that corresponds to out-of-tree somehow, and for me, when I began with LLVM or MLIR,

46
0:04:15.640 --> 0:04:21.440
I was not a compiler developer, but I had some experience in CMake, and how these terms

47
0:04:21.440 --> 0:04:27.120
out-of-tree are used in LLVM and MLIR and the outer world are sometimes confusing, so

48
0:04:27.120 --> 0:04:30.880
I want to give at least a short definition.

49
0:04:30.880 --> 0:04:38.840
So in the LLVM world, Intree also often or nearly every time refers to a monolithic build.

50
0:04:38.840 --> 0:04:45.240
That means you build LLVM or your LLVM subproject, plus your dialects or whatever.

51
0:04:45.240 --> 0:04:47.760
Intree can refer to the source location.

52
0:04:47.760 --> 0:04:53.320
So here we have an out-of-tree dialect, which is however part of the LLVM MonoRepo, but

53
0:04:53.320 --> 0:04:59.720
it's considered out-of-tree because you can pull it out and you don't need to have it

54
0:04:59.720 --> 0:05:01.400
in the MonoRepo.

55
0:05:01.400 --> 0:05:06.360
So out-of-tree normally refers to work with a separate repository.

56
0:05:06.360 --> 0:05:11.920
However, there is also a mechanism which you can use to build your project with this LLVM

57
0:05:11.920 --> 0:05:17.160
external projects mechanism, and projects using this, and if you look into their CMake

58
0:05:17.160 --> 0:05:23.160
configuration or into other tutorials, either they call it out-of-tree monolithic build,

59
0:05:23.160 --> 0:05:28.480
so it's not a component build like you have against an installed MLIR or LLVM, or they

60
0:05:28.480 --> 0:05:33.520
even call it Intree, which is somehow confusing because when you look to CMake, normally Intree

61
0:05:33.520 --> 0:05:39.160
just means you're building where your source code lives, which is actually a bad practice.

62
0:05:39.160 --> 0:05:40.680
You shouldn't do this.

63
0:05:40.680 --> 0:05:42.280
Normally you do out-of-tree builds.

64
0:05:42.280 --> 0:05:47.640
It just means you create a separate directory where you set up a configuration and where

65
0:05:47.640 --> 0:05:48.780
you do your build.

66
0:05:48.780 --> 0:05:55.400
This can also be a subdirectory in the source tree, but it's a separate directory not checked

67
0:05:55.400 --> 0:05:57.960
into your Git later on.

68
0:05:57.960 --> 0:06:05.420
So within this talk, I just call it the external project mechanism.

69
0:06:05.420 --> 0:06:08.480
For me, it's always an out-of-tree build.

70
0:06:08.480 --> 0:06:14.160
Regardless of what I do, even if I build LLVM, I wouldn't call it personally Intree because

71
0:06:14.160 --> 0:06:16.760
I'm using the CMake notation normally.

72
0:06:16.760 --> 0:06:22.520
It's to make it clear when you look into some of the projects and don't get confused.

73
0:06:22.520 --> 0:06:29.320
What we can do is we can extend the standalone project by the LLVM external project mechanism,

74
0:06:29.320 --> 0:06:31.760
and the question is why should we do this?

75
0:06:31.760 --> 0:06:37.560
Stephen Neuendeuer gave a great tutorial about how to architecture LLVM projects at the LLVM

76
0:06:37.560 --> 0:06:40.880
Dev Meeting 2021, which is available on YouTube.

77
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:46.000
I also have the link in my references.

78
0:06:46.000 --> 0:06:54.000
Here we are referring to a monolithic build, and historically he says use the component

79
0:06:54.000 --> 0:06:55.000
builds.

80
0:06:55.000 --> 0:06:58.200
That is what the standalone project already gives you.

81
0:06:58.200 --> 0:07:03.160
But there are some benefits when you maybe want to use the LLVM external projects.

82
0:07:03.160 --> 0:07:09.120
So what we actually do is when we developed the MHC dialect, we developed this as an out-of-tree

83
0:07:09.120 --> 0:07:18.920
dialect, completely independent or buildable against an installed MLIR version.

84
0:07:18.920 --> 0:07:24.040
MHC is now part of the MLIR core, so it's upstreamed.

85
0:07:24.040 --> 0:07:29.960
What we normally do is, or what's quite nice is, sometimes we want to look into when we

86
0:07:29.960 --> 0:07:36.240
change our dialect upstream or when we extend it, how does it behave together with our out-of-tree

87
0:07:36.240 --> 0:07:41.920
source, which we still have, all our conversions, all our transformations are not upstreamed

88
0:07:41.920 --> 0:07:43.920
yet.

89
0:07:43.920 --> 0:07:49.440
It's quite nice to build it as run project because you can easily debug into, you don't

90
0:07:49.440 --> 0:07:55.440
have to keep your installation and what you're building out of source, you don't have to

91
0:07:55.440 --> 0:07:57.680
keep this in sync, you just have a monolithic build.

92
0:07:57.680 --> 0:08:02.760
There are some benefits, and we just want to look into what do we need to do to build

93
0:08:02.760 --> 0:08:06.360
it with the LLVM external project mechanism.

94
0:08:06.360 --> 0:08:13.760
So we are creating our build directory again, then we have to define the LLVM targets to

95
0:08:13.760 --> 0:08:18.920
build, so here you need to specify for which architecture you want to build LLVM, so here

96
0:08:18.920 --> 0:08:22.800
it's just host or x86, which is also an option.

97
0:08:22.800 --> 0:08:30.200
You must specify the build type, either release, debug, min source with rel info, whatever,

98
0:08:30.200 --> 0:08:36.400
and we need to enable our project MLIR, otherwise it's not built.

99
0:08:36.400 --> 0:08:42.920
And in addition to that, as we want to build our standalone project, we use LL, or we specify

100
0:08:42.920 --> 0:08:48.880
LLVM external projects, standalone dialect, which is our project name, and furthermore

101
0:08:48.880 --> 0:08:55.000
we specify LLVM external standalone dialect source tree to specify where do we find our

102
0:08:55.000 --> 0:09:04.000
source, that are the two additional parameters you need to pass, and here LLVM source tree,

103
0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:08.360
actually we assume that it points to the root of our mono repo checked out.

104
0:09:08.360 --> 0:09:12.800
So that is what we want to have later on, right now the standalone example can't do

105
0:09:12.800 --> 0:09:17.680
this, what do we need to change to make this possible?

106
0:09:17.680 --> 0:09:24.320
So right now it's looking like the following, looking to the main CMake configuration, and

107
0:09:24.320 --> 0:09:30.160
what is important here is we have find package, we call find package MLIR, and find package

108
0:09:30.160 --> 0:09:34.900
in general imports information which we exported by a project.

109
0:09:34.900 --> 0:09:42.160
So here find package imports information from the installed MLIR version, and furthermore

110
0:09:42.160 --> 0:09:47.800
the find package MLIR also calls find package LLVM for us, so we don't need to care about

111
0:09:47.800 --> 0:09:57.520
this, so we can then just, well the MLIR config CMake is actually parsed as well as the LLVM

112
0:09:57.520 --> 0:10:05.520
config CMake parsed, and we can gladly just do our includes which adds some further code

113
0:10:05.520 --> 0:10:06.880
for us.

114
0:10:06.880 --> 0:10:13.560
So for the external project mechanism build we don't need to do this, so what we need

115
0:10:13.560 --> 0:10:19.640
to change is we only need to call find package if there is an installed MLIR, otherwise there

116
0:10:19.640 --> 0:10:23.860
won't be one because we're just building it as part of our build process.

117
0:10:23.860 --> 0:10:32.280
So in that case CMake sourced here normally is equal to CMake current sourced here.

118
0:10:32.280 --> 0:10:37.440
If it's not the case we have a different build type and we're just adding this if else block

119
0:10:37.440 --> 0:10:46.840
and we don't have the need no longer for our other project to load the CMake modules with

120
0:10:46.840 --> 0:10:47.840
include.

121
0:10:47.840 --> 0:10:56.960
And the code we're adding is we're just setting the variables which are not available as exported

122
0:10:56.960 --> 0:11:02.960
project settings by ourselves, so MLIR main source here, main include here, and that's

123
0:11:02.960 --> 0:11:04.520
actually it.

124
0:11:04.520 --> 0:11:08.280
So that are the few lines we need to make it buildable.

125
0:11:08.280 --> 0:11:11.360
However your lit tests will fail.

126
0:11:11.360 --> 0:11:16.960
So there is a little bit more code that we need to modify.

127
0:11:16.960 --> 0:11:23.480
Here we just define a standalone source here and standalone binary variables which are

128
0:11:23.480 --> 0:11:28.800
then later on used also for our include directories.

129
0:11:28.800 --> 0:11:33.560
And we adjust our lit side cfg.py accordingly.

130
0:11:33.560 --> 0:11:42.280
So here we actually need to change CMake binary D or CMake source here by our newly set variable

131
0:11:42.280 --> 0:11:53.200
otherwise the lit tests are the location of lit cfg is assumed in the wrong place.

132
0:11:53.200 --> 0:11:58.560
So we just fix that here.

133
0:11:58.560 --> 0:12:00.340
That's nearly it.

134
0:12:00.340 --> 0:12:06.800
So when you now want to use a dialect with other dialects and you have these in several

135
0:12:06.800 --> 0:12:13.240
repositories or with several projects at least, you can either use LLVM external projects

136
0:12:13.240 --> 0:12:14.920
to build multiple dialects.

137
0:12:14.920 --> 0:12:18.960
Torch MLIR for example is doing exactly this.

138
0:12:18.960 --> 0:12:25.040
Another option is to use CMake's external project add which is considered as the cleanest

139
0:12:25.040 --> 0:12:33.040
way as it really keeps the projects enclosed and doesn't transfer reliability between the

140
0:12:33.040 --> 0:12:34.040
projects.

141
0:12:34.040 --> 0:12:42.640
However what I normally do is I use add subdirectory but in addition with the exclude from all

142
0:12:42.640 --> 0:12:50.680
so no only the build targets I really use are exported or transferred to the other project.

143
0:12:50.680 --> 0:12:57.680
And we do this in our MLIR MHC repository and to do this we actually have an option

144
0:12:57.680 --> 0:13:04.600
just embedded which changes our source code a little bit so only when we want to call

145
0:13:04.600 --> 0:13:11.840
it embedded then we check is it the case or not because the find package is already done

146
0:13:11.840 --> 0:13:14.320
by the other project we don't need to call this.

147
0:13:14.320 --> 0:13:20.500
We only do the includes which we don't need for the external project mechanism.

148
0:13:20.500 --> 0:13:25.040
So getting to types.

149
0:13:25.040 --> 0:13:29.840
This is how the standalone dialect is currently structured or at least most of it there are

150
0:13:29.840 --> 0:13:34.420
also some tools standalone ops standalone translate which I would consider here and

151
0:13:34.420 --> 0:13:40.960
you see we have multiple finds and types could be specified in standalone ops dot TD in our

152
0:13:40.960 --> 0:13:43.640
tablegen definition file.

153
0:13:43.640 --> 0:13:52.840
However it's quite nice to not put it in all into one file but to use separate files.

154
0:13:52.840 --> 0:13:58.160
So what we are doing is we are adding new files we are adding a tablegen file standalone

155
0:13:58.160 --> 0:14:03.320
types we are adding a header file and we are adding the CPP for our implementation and

156
0:14:03.320 --> 0:14:07.880
what you need to put into those are actually the following.

157
0:14:07.880 --> 0:14:09.940
Let's start with the tablegen file.

158
0:14:09.940 --> 0:14:17.280
First of all we include the attribute type base and the dialect itself because the dialect

159
0:14:17.280 --> 0:14:24.460
has some definitions and then we can define our standalone types class which is the base

160
0:14:24.460 --> 0:14:33.040
class for types and in addition to that we can define a custom type actually this is

161
0:14:33.040 --> 0:14:38.320
a simple copy of a mid-seas or park type quite straightforward but here we use a standard

162
0:14:38.320 --> 0:14:45.680
assembly format so no custom parser and printer and it just holds a string referometer so

163
0:14:45.680 --> 0:14:48.480
nothing special just to illustrate the example.

164
0:14:48.480 --> 0:14:53.840
So that is how the tablegen file could look like.

165
0:14:53.840 --> 0:14:59.680
Getting to standalone ops we can just replace the include of standalone dialect by standalone

166
0:14:59.680 --> 0:15:08.160
types and this is because the types already includes the tablegen TD file so that's as

167
0:15:08.160 --> 0:15:11.920
fine and that's it.

168
0:15:11.920 --> 0:15:16.600
Regarding the CMAK list we don't need anything to change why is that?

169
0:15:16.600 --> 0:15:25.000
Actually at MLIR dialect already calls MLIR tablegen for you with gen type def decals

170
0:15:25.000 --> 0:15:31.960
and type def definitions so that's fine we don't need to change anything here.

171
0:15:31.960 --> 0:15:38.360
Remember for attributes that would be different because for attributes the atMLIR dialect

172
0:15:38.360 --> 0:15:44.680
doesn't call MLIR tablegen for you so just set the algorithm target definitions by yourself

173
0:15:44.680 --> 0:15:51.680
call MLIR tablegen by yourself add a public tablegen target and that's it so attributes

174
0:15:51.680 --> 0:15:59.760
are quite close related to or quite similar except for that you need to adjust your CMAK

175
0:15:59.760 --> 0:16:01.920
configuration by yourself.

176
0:16:01.920 --> 0:16:06.920
For the header file just include the auto generated type def classes in the header that's

177
0:16:06.920 --> 0:16:12.960
it add the define the include nothing more to do.

178
0:16:12.960 --> 0:16:20.400
For our implementation we need to make sure that the types can actually be registered

179
0:16:20.400 --> 0:16:27.280
by the parent dialect so what we do is we have a define here get type def classes we

180
0:16:27.280 --> 0:16:36.840
include then our generated code generated by tablegen and then we write a function register

181
0:16:36.840 --> 0:16:45.640
types which actually calls the method add types plus some of the auto generated code

182
0:16:45.640 --> 0:16:52.080
and this needs to be called in our standalone dialect.cpp so we just add the register types

183
0:16:52.080 --> 0:16:58.960
here and that's nearly the role trick you can do the same not with add operands or add

184
0:16:58.960 --> 0:17:05.760
types but with add attributes for attributes and to register your attributes.

185
0:17:05.760 --> 0:17:14.280
For the CMAK list itself just add this to your MLIR standard library dialect library

186
0:17:14.280 --> 0:17:18.520
target that's it nothing more to do.

187
0:17:18.520 --> 0:17:23.880
For attributes you can also just add your source code or you must add your source file

188
0:17:23.880 --> 0:17:29.280
here of course but in addition you also need a dependency on MLIR standalone attributes

189
0:17:29.280 --> 0:17:36.720
inkgen the target we generate or we create it by hand because it's not auto generated

190
0:17:36.720 --> 0:17:45.680
just to make sure that tablegen generates the code before CMAK tries to or before the

191
0:17:45.680 --> 0:17:51.400
MLIR standalone target is built you might be lucky otherwise you might have a race condition

192
0:17:51.400 --> 0:17:59.680
in your build system I experienced that several times try to fix it or just keep it in mind

193
0:17:59.680 --> 0:18:01.760
and that's mainly it.

194
0:18:01.760 --> 0:18:08.960
For the standalone dialect here we use the default printer and parser just let us tell

195
0:18:08.960 --> 0:18:19.160
tablegen to generate those and for register types actually we need of course a declaration

196
0:18:19.160 --> 0:18:25.240
we have the implementation but we also need the extra cast declaration generated by tablegen

197
0:18:25.240 --> 0:18:32.480
otherwise yeah we cannot use it in our standard ops.cpp.

198
0:18:32.480 --> 0:18:42.200
So all the examples are available in my fork of the LLVM project I couldn't make it to

199
0:18:42.200 --> 0:18:48.240
send these via fabricated to be reviewed through App Serum Inclusion prior to my talk but I

200
0:18:48.240 --> 0:18:56.560
will do so I will add some more documentation to this that's at least my goal.

201
0:18:56.560 --> 0:19:02.200
So when I planned this talk I thought that's what maybe some hints which could have one

202
0:19:02.200 --> 0:19:07.320
or the other and hopefully it's even more helpful if you not only find it in the slides

203
0:19:07.320 --> 0:19:14.120
below it's in the upstream example and there are many good resources out there so the talk

204
0:19:14.120 --> 0:19:19.960
given by media mini and River Riddle the MLIR primer the MLIR tutorial at the 2020 LLVM

205
0:19:19.960 --> 0:19:29.280
staff meeting we have some great talks at MLIR LLVM.org here how to create a dialect

206
0:19:29.280 --> 0:19:34.160
the toy example for example how to combine it how to add attribute and types if you want

207
0:19:34.160 --> 0:19:40.160
to get more into the details what you can do all in the tablegen world and last but

208
0:19:40.160 --> 0:19:48.880
not least the tutorial given by Stephen Neuendeuer at the LLVM 2021 staff meeting yeah so that's

209
0:19:48.880 --> 0:19:57.520
it from my side so if you have questions please let me know and I try to answer them.

210
0:19:57.520 --> 0:20:20.280
I just recently got into learning how to develop compilers even less how to create languages

211
0:20:20.280 --> 0:20:28.920
and I'm going to talk about how to use LLVM as a backend for a really abstracted C-type

212
0:20:28.920 --> 0:20:36.400
language which I'm working on and use LLVM as a backend to generate machine code for

213
0:20:36.400 --> 0:20:50.520
x86 and my understanding was that I only had to use or generate an IR for LLVM the LLVM

214
0:20:50.520 --> 0:20:57.520
IR and now you mentioned that LLVM IR can be described or is somehow related with the

215
0:20:57.520 --> 0:21:04.440
LLVM or sorry the MLIR right so I was wondering if I'm still on the correct track to try to

216
0:21:04.440 --> 0:21:12.040
generate the parse tree and use LLVM and try to generate the standard LLVM IR and target

217
0:21:12.040 --> 0:21:19.800
the x86 or an x86 platform or do I need to learn something about the MLIR?

218
0:21:19.800 --> 0:21:25.840
So to trying to summarize your question the question is when as a compiler starter you

219
0:21:25.840 --> 0:21:31.760
are mostly focusing on parsing an abstract C-type like language and want to know if you

220
0:21:31.760 --> 0:21:39.600
can just go through the ordinary LLVM IR way or if you need to plug in switch over to MLIR

221
0:21:39.600 --> 0:21:46.680
to do what you want so in real short so you can do this definitely you can you can go

222
0:21:46.680 --> 0:21:54.920
the way you're right now doing so MLIR actually is a little bit yeah different so if you if

223
0:21:54.920 --> 0:22:01.540
we are looking to clang I don't if you're talking about an abstract C language looking

224
0:22:01.540 --> 0:22:06.920
into clang there is clang AST and then we directly more or less go to LLVM IR and that

225
0:22:06.920 --> 0:22:15.800
is one of the things which yeah isn't that nice or if you look into other compilers they

226
0:22:15.800 --> 0:22:21.120
introduce more intermediate representations in between like we will see later on in the

227
0:22:21.120 --> 0:22:26.560
session the flang app that for example or even Swift has two intermediate representations

228
0:22:26.560 --> 0:22:36.040
for example so MLIR just gives you the ability to define additional intermediate representations

229
0:22:36.040 --> 0:22:42.040
so you can you can also write a front end for for your for your language pass it into

230
0:22:42.040 --> 0:22:51.120
MLIR trans yeah convert it to LL to the LLVM IR dialect and then translate it to LLVM IR

231
0:22:51.120 --> 0:22:55.160
so that would be identical it really depends on what you want to do what kind of infrastructure

232
0:22:55.160 --> 0:23:01.100
you want to use but you can the way you can go the way you're already going so hopefully

233
0:23:01.100 --> 0:23:27.920
that somehow at least answers your question okay the question is not directly related

234
0:23:27.920 --> 0:23:35.280
to the talk but as I'm one of the developers behind MHC why we developed MHC sometimes

235
0:23:35.280 --> 0:23:44.000
you cannot compile with clang or directly or with LLVM at all to your to your target

236
0:23:44.000 --> 0:23:52.760
so the idea was to get to to get something independent of the compiler and if we when

237
0:23:52.760 --> 0:24:01.680
we actually yeah generate C code with MHC you can have have send a freedom to choose

238
0:24:01.680 --> 0:24:07.720
which compiler you want to use to translate for your for your final target so we are in

239
0:24:07.720 --> 0:24:13.560
the domain of compilers for machine learning and sometimes we have some very exotic targets

240
0:24:13.560 --> 0:24:18.800
where clang unfortunately is not the option to to use it as a compiler so that's the simple

241
0:24:18.800 --> 0:24:29.780
reason I was looking to doing some sort of log

242
0:24:29.780 --> 0:24:37.220
I was looking into doing some sort of just in time compilation.

243
0:24:37.220 --> 0:24:46.020
But I also wanted to define my own types and my own, let's say, things.

244
0:24:46.020 --> 0:24:51.100
My question is, would MLIR be a good fit for that?

245
0:24:51.100 --> 0:24:57.740
Or would possibly just see with some sort of, I don't know,

246
0:24:57.740 --> 0:25:04.140
dynamic library, you can argue with it.

247
0:25:04.140 --> 0:25:09.900
So the question is, when coming from the other side, so for

248
0:25:09.900 --> 0:25:16.540
JIT, essentially, if MLIR might be a good fit to define your own types and attributes.

249
0:25:17.540 --> 0:25:23.740
And well, I'm not an expert regarding JIT, but MLIR provides you,

250
0:25:23.740 --> 0:25:30.260
I think most of the codes are upstream, provides you the possibility to

251
0:25:30.260 --> 0:25:35.220
register types and attributes, I'm quite sure at least, at runtime.

252
0:25:35.220 --> 0:25:40.900
So you can extend your dialect after you compiled MLIR.

253
0:25:40.900 --> 0:25:44.860
So that is maybe, yeah, depending on what you wanna do,

254
0:25:46.020 --> 0:25:48.700
if you really want to modify it during runtime.

255
0:25:48.700 --> 0:25:53.940
Just to instantiate new types during runtime.

256
0:25:53.940 --> 0:25:56.900
That should be possible with MLIR.

257
0:25:56.900 --> 0:26:00.900
So I'm not 100% sure, but at least worth a look, I think.

258
0:26:09.900 --> 0:26:12.420
Yeah, I also have a question, last question.

259
0:26:12.420 --> 0:26:17.260
So I've been interacting with some people that define a new language to define

260
0:26:17.260 --> 0:26:21.180
dialects, or a dialect to define dialects, called IRDL.

261
0:26:21.180 --> 0:26:23.260
I'm not sure if you know that.

262
0:26:23.260 --> 0:26:28.340
I was wondering, this would probably change the entire flow of building a dialect,

263
0:26:28.340 --> 0:26:29.900
right, or?

264
0:26:29.900 --> 0:26:36.660
Well, I'm partly aware of IRDL, but I don't know,

265
0:26:36.660 --> 0:26:42.860
you mean how you compose it via CMake in the targets or what?

266
0:26:42.860 --> 0:26:45.020
Yes, you mean this, yeah.

267
0:26:45.020 --> 0:26:50.180
Yeah, probably as you, with IRDL, as far as I know,

268
0:26:50.180 --> 0:26:55.540
as you do most of the time at runtime, you wouldn't need to build it in advance.

269
0:26:55.540 --> 0:27:00.500
So yeah, the CMake stuff would be somehow obsolete, yeah.

270
0:27:00.500 --> 0:27:01.020
I think so.

271
0:27:08.020 --> 0:27:10.620
All right, if we're out of questions, thank you, Maurice.

272
0:27:10.620 --> 0:27:11.120
Thank you.

273
0:27:11.120 --> 0:27:16.120
And we'll see you next time.
