1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.520
Okay. Hello. Bonjour.

2
0:00:10.520 --> 0:00:12.800
Who did our good talk?

3
0:00:12.800 --> 0:00:17.120
I think that's sort of the Brussels welcome.

4
0:00:17.360 --> 0:00:20.040
Yeah. So I want to talk about

5
0:00:20.040 --> 0:00:21.920
what we're doing in the Postgres project

6
0:00:21.920 --> 0:00:23.600
with respect to translation.

7
0:00:23.600 --> 0:00:25.880
It seems like the last two talks already

8
0:00:25.880 --> 0:00:27.960
solved 50 percent of my problems.

9
0:00:27.960 --> 0:00:31.680
So there was already a good outcome of coming here.

10
0:00:31.680 --> 0:00:33.440
I want to talk a little bit more sort of

11
0:00:33.440 --> 0:00:37.440
the lower levels of what GetTAC specifically does,

12
0:00:37.440 --> 0:00:38.840
but I'll also goes kind of through

13
0:00:38.840 --> 0:00:41.160
what other things we're doing.

14
0:00:41.320 --> 0:00:46.000
So I am in the Postgres project.

15
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:47.960
I'm just a C programmer.

16
0:00:47.960 --> 0:00:52.840
It's my job really to do the translation sort of as a hobby on the side.

17
0:00:52.840 --> 0:00:57.600
I have done initially sort of most of the setup.

18
0:00:57.600 --> 0:01:03.160
So of the source code level,

19
0:01:03.160 --> 0:01:05.840
what he called internationalization at that case.

20
0:01:05.840 --> 0:01:08.680
Then I'm also doing some of the translation.

21
0:01:09.280 --> 0:01:13.480
Yeah. It turns out also

22
0:01:13.480 --> 0:01:16.880
the first faucet I went to was 20 years ago.

23
0:01:16.880 --> 0:01:19.520
I like coming here because there's

24
0:01:19.520 --> 0:01:21.080
a Postgres dev room happening at

25
0:01:21.080 --> 0:01:22.240
the same time in a different building,

26
0:01:22.240 --> 0:01:25.160
but I like to come to all the other places

27
0:01:25.160 --> 0:01:26.960
and sort of intersect with other communities and learn

28
0:01:26.960 --> 0:01:28.920
about other kind of stuff that's happening.

29
0:01:28.920 --> 0:01:32.880
So it's kind of a good benefit of FOSDEM.

30
0:01:32.880 --> 0:01:34.640
So what's Postgres?

31
0:01:34.640 --> 0:01:36.960
Don't need to go into details,

32
0:01:36.960 --> 0:01:40.840
but it's a little bit different.

33
0:01:40.840 --> 0:01:42.360
It has different requirements.

34
0:01:42.360 --> 0:01:43.360
It's a database system.

35
0:01:43.360 --> 0:01:47.040
It's fairly big and fairly old,

36
0:01:47.040 --> 0:01:51.840
but it's different from like a GUI program, let's say.

37
0:01:51.840 --> 0:01:54.480
Something we've leave office

38
0:01:54.480 --> 0:01:56.680
or hear from KDE later on things like that.

39
0:01:56.680 --> 0:02:00.520
I think it just lives much longer

40
0:02:00.520 --> 0:02:06.760
and has longer stability requirements and things like that.

41
0:02:06.760 --> 0:02:10.560
That also kind of makes the maintenance of everything

42
0:02:10.560 --> 0:02:11.880
a little bit more complicated.

43
0:02:11.880 --> 0:02:14.520
We also maintain back branches.

44
0:02:14.520 --> 0:02:16.400
So we have a yearly release,

45
0:02:16.400 --> 0:02:21.400
but we still maintain the old releases for at least five years.

46
0:02:21.400 --> 0:02:22.600
So at any given moment,

47
0:02:22.600 --> 0:02:26.920
we have four or five or six releases live.

48
0:02:26.920 --> 0:02:29.480
That gives it interesting challenges

49
0:02:29.480 --> 0:02:30.720
with back-patching stuff.

50
0:02:30.720 --> 0:02:33.400
Just I was quite interested in the last question we had

51
0:02:33.400 --> 0:02:35.440
in the previous talk about this translation memory

52
0:02:35.440 --> 0:02:37.040
and sort of that rung through.

53
0:02:37.040 --> 0:02:39.840
Can we automatically apply the memory

54
0:02:39.840 --> 0:02:43.560
to the previous branches and stuff like that?

55
0:02:43.560 --> 0:02:47.960
So this sort of stuff is a practical challenge

56
0:02:47.960 --> 0:02:50.080
because you have to keep copying the same thing

57
0:02:50.080 --> 0:02:52.840
to all the different branches and so on.

58
0:02:56.840 --> 0:03:00.200
Any case, so what are we doing in Postgres?

59
0:03:00.200 --> 0:03:03.640
You know we use GetX as in the title.

60
0:03:04.800 --> 0:03:07.840
Now put this sort of standard new question mark.

61
0:03:07.840 --> 0:03:10.960
It's kind of weird because again Postgres is old

62
0:03:10.960 --> 0:03:14.320
and runs on servers is a little bit different

63
0:03:14.320 --> 0:03:17.480
from sort of what runs on a laptop or an app.

64
0:03:17.480 --> 0:03:21.200
Because for example, we also support operating systems

65
0:03:21.200 --> 0:03:25.120
that might still already be forgotten like AIX and Solaris.

66
0:03:25.120 --> 0:03:28.800
And they have GetXed originally came from the sort of

67
0:03:28.800 --> 0:03:33.800
solaris sphere somehow and there's still a,

68
0:03:36.800 --> 0:03:37.720
well I don't know what it is now,

69
0:03:37.720 --> 0:03:41.720
but like a Solaris native Solaris GetXed exists.

70
0:03:41.720 --> 0:03:44.640
It's you know, that's distinct from new.

71
0:03:44.640 --> 0:03:48.400
But it's sort of old has bugs and doesn't parse stuff

72
0:03:48.400 --> 0:03:52.400
correctly sometimes so when you just sort of use

73
0:03:52.400 --> 0:03:55.200
you use the new version then sometimes the files

74
0:03:55.200 --> 0:03:58.240
you distribute don't work on old Solaris for some reason

75
0:03:58.240 --> 0:04:00.920
and then this is sort of just a weird situation.

76
0:04:00.920 --> 0:04:03.760
You have to like then fix these things

77
0:04:03.760 --> 0:04:07.960
and then or hope that Solaris dies at some point, right?

78
0:04:07.960 --> 0:04:08.800
Stuff like that.

79
0:04:08.800 --> 0:04:10.780
So it's like that.

80
0:04:10.780 --> 0:04:15.280
So we have, I mean, you know, we hear from KDE Next.

81
0:04:15.280 --> 0:04:17.380
I already looked at Hetzel at their abstract.

82
0:04:17.380 --> 0:04:20.380
This is obviously not a lot in terms of how many languages

83
0:04:20.380 --> 0:04:22.080
and message catalogs and strings we have,

84
0:04:22.080 --> 0:04:26.560
but it's more than something you can just deal with

85
0:04:26.560 --> 0:04:27.720
in an afternoon, right?

86
0:04:27.720 --> 0:04:29.720
It's just a lot of stuff to move around.

87
0:04:29.720 --> 0:04:32.320
I mentioned with the different branches,

88
0:04:32.320 --> 0:04:34.480
we also have it in a separate Git repository.

89
0:04:34.480 --> 0:04:36.920
I think that's kind of common, I think,

90
0:04:36.920 --> 0:04:38.960
so that you can manage access to translators

91
0:04:38.960 --> 0:04:40.680
separate from the source repository

92
0:04:40.680 --> 0:04:42.680
and then you just move it back and forth.

93
0:04:43.880 --> 0:04:46.880
Again, maybe the web label will help with that

94
0:04:46.880 --> 0:04:50.460
and we have also sort of other projects in the vicinity

95
0:04:50.460 --> 0:04:54.400
of the core server projects such as JDBC driver,

96
0:04:54.400 --> 0:04:57.520
which is obviously in Java, which is slightly different

97
0:04:57.520 --> 0:04:58.920
sort of tooling and stuff like that.

98
0:04:58.920 --> 0:05:01.540
And PG Admin is a GUI.

99
0:05:01.540 --> 0:05:02.680
They have their own workflow.

100
0:05:02.680 --> 0:05:04.440
So it's all a little bit all over the place

101
0:05:04.440 --> 0:05:07.880
and it's hard to kind of keep that all moving

102
0:05:07.880 --> 0:05:10.200
in the same way.

103
0:05:12.240 --> 0:05:14.980
And there's also some documentations are being translated,

104
0:05:14.980 --> 0:05:17.200
but that's also handled completely separately.

105
0:05:17.200 --> 0:05:18.480
We were actually just talking to break.

106
0:05:18.480 --> 0:05:21.000
We could use Libra Translate for that maybe at some point.

107
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:24.000
So all kinds of interesting ideas already coming up here.

108
0:05:27.020 --> 0:05:32.020
All right, so this is my like web late, but terrible job.

109
0:05:32.020 --> 0:05:37.020
This is kind of how we handle it.

110
0:05:37.180 --> 0:05:42.180
The web interface is under bobble.postgresql.org.

111
0:05:42.480 --> 0:05:44.380
And that just gives you sort of the status, right?

112
0:05:44.380 --> 0:05:47.900
Of what languages and what the message catalogs are.

113
0:05:47.900 --> 0:05:52.900
And it does sort of the string extraction,

114
0:05:53.460 --> 0:05:56.860
the merging in the background as you would do, you know,

115
0:05:56.860 --> 0:05:59.060
in the make file, but it just kind of runs it for you

116
0:05:59.060 --> 0:05:59.900
from a cron job.

117
0:05:59.900 --> 0:06:01.180
Again, it's just sort of really old,

118
0:06:01.180 --> 0:06:02.180
but it does the job.

119
0:06:02.180 --> 0:06:05.620
And then the workflow is, yeah, you go like, you know,

120
0:06:05.620 --> 0:06:08.920
you pick your language, pick what you want to work on.

121
0:06:08.920 --> 0:06:10.300
You click on it, you download it,

122
0:06:10.300 --> 0:06:13.180
you do the translation with the, you know,

123
0:06:13.180 --> 0:06:15.380
the get text tools, whatever editor you want to use,

124
0:06:15.380 --> 0:06:17.180
different people use different things.

125
0:06:18.340 --> 0:06:20.420
And then you commit it back, right?

126
0:06:20.420 --> 0:06:24.160
And there's different, all the branches are available here.

127
0:06:24.160 --> 0:06:27.220
So you can scroll down and you're just going to fill these

128
0:06:27.220 --> 0:06:32.220
up and so, yeah, these are the languages across here.

129
0:06:32.700 --> 0:06:36.480
What the colors mean is that green is 100% translated.

130
0:06:37.480 --> 0:06:40.500
And then one thing we did, which I don't,

131
0:06:40.500 --> 0:06:45.500
we just kind of made up, but we decided if a message catalog

132
0:06:46.260 --> 0:06:48.620
is not translated to at least 80%, we're not going to ship

133
0:06:48.620 --> 0:06:50.320
it, right?

134
0:06:50.320 --> 0:06:52.860
You don't want to just ship like one string.

135
0:06:52.860 --> 0:06:54.700
I mean, you could, but it would be weird for a user

136
0:06:54.700 --> 0:06:57.140
that all of a sudden the translated string pops up

137
0:06:57.140 --> 0:06:58.860
and nothing else is translated, right?

138
0:06:58.860 --> 0:07:00.140
It's maybe a little bit weird.

139
0:07:00.140 --> 0:07:03.620
So that's something we sort of decided on until randomly

140
0:07:03.620 --> 0:07:05.620
and it seems to actually kind of work pretty well.

141
0:07:05.620 --> 0:07:08.260
So the yellow ones are the ones that we would ship

142
0:07:09.500 --> 0:07:11.460
and then the white ones are just the ones

143
0:07:11.460 --> 0:07:13.320
that are not complete at all.

144
0:07:16.740 --> 0:07:21.740
All right, so workflow is the usual get text workflow

145
0:07:21.780 --> 0:07:23.260
for at least C programs, you know,

146
0:07:23.260 --> 0:07:24.460
there's other stuff happening nowadays.

147
0:07:24.460 --> 0:07:27.020
So if the developer marks up the messages

148
0:07:27.020 --> 0:07:30.700
with this kind of underscore thing that they recommend

149
0:07:30.700 --> 0:07:34.620
and our developers are totally good about that, right?

150
0:07:34.620 --> 0:07:36.780
They're all aware of that you need to do that.

151
0:07:36.780 --> 0:07:41.700
And for the most part, it's wrapped into things like this.

152
0:07:41.700 --> 0:07:44.300
So you don't actually have to manually mock up everything.

153
0:07:44.300 --> 0:07:46.500
If you use like this sort of standard internal API,

154
0:07:46.500 --> 0:07:50.180
say print an error, log an error, whatever the case may be,

155
0:07:50.180 --> 0:07:51.340
then it's already done for you.

156
0:07:51.340 --> 0:07:52.700
So that works pretty well.

157
0:07:52.700 --> 0:07:56.620
It's, you know, every once in a while something gets missed,

158
0:07:56.620 --> 0:07:57.500
but it's not a big problem.

159
0:07:57.500 --> 0:07:59.940
All the developer group is aware of that.

160
0:08:00.940 --> 0:08:05.940
Then I mentioned the website uses those standard tools

161
0:08:08.140 --> 0:08:12.180
to give you something you just have to download

162
0:08:12.180 --> 0:08:15.980
and then you just translated and upload it back.

163
0:08:17.300 --> 0:08:21.660
Then at release time, someone, often me,

164
0:08:21.660 --> 0:08:24.100
just then runs a script to copy that over,

165
0:08:24.100 --> 0:08:26.500
which could be automated, but you know,

166
0:08:26.500 --> 0:08:31.020
it's one of those things we have releases four times a year

167
0:08:31.020 --> 0:08:33.460
and you just do it manually four times a year

168
0:08:33.460 --> 0:08:36.260
or you could spend X hours automating it, right?

169
0:08:36.260 --> 0:08:38.180
So usually it's just done manually.

170
0:08:41.980 --> 0:08:44.660
All right, so this is our tool chain at the moment.

171
0:08:46.260 --> 0:08:48.660
Again, GNU, question mark, get text.

172
0:08:48.660 --> 0:08:51.780
We have a pretty standard sort of configure,

173
0:08:51.780 --> 0:08:55.300
make, make, install, build system.

174
0:08:55.300 --> 0:08:57.620
We don't use any of these make file templates

175
0:08:57.620 --> 0:08:59.140
and things like that, that ship it, get text,

176
0:08:59.140 --> 0:09:04.140
because we have our own sort of very convoluted build system

177
0:09:04.220 --> 0:09:06.020
based on GNU make.

178
0:09:06.020 --> 0:09:07.660
We're also in the process of getting rid of that.

179
0:09:07.660 --> 0:09:10.600
So we're moving to, to Mason now,

180
0:09:11.580 --> 0:09:15.060
which has some support for that built in,

181
0:09:15.060 --> 0:09:16.900
but it's kind of incomplete.

182
0:09:16.900 --> 0:09:21.540
So we're sort of stuck sort of halfway here, halfway there.

183
0:09:21.540 --> 0:09:22.380
I have to kind of work,

184
0:09:22.380 --> 0:09:24.820
that's kind of work we're doing right now.

185
0:09:24.820 --> 0:09:26.020
I have to figure that out.

186
0:09:28.100 --> 0:09:31.200
So people use whatever editor they want to use.

187
0:09:32.340 --> 0:09:34.420
Poet it seems to be somewhat popular.

188
0:09:34.420 --> 0:09:35.860
I use just Emacs.

189
0:09:36.740 --> 0:09:40.300
Some teams have used, by teams I mean sort of language teams.

190
0:09:40.300 --> 0:09:42.780
They have used crowd in,

191
0:09:42.780 --> 0:09:47.340
which I suppose is sort of similar to Webblade maybe.

192
0:09:48.160 --> 0:09:50.100
But again, we were just talking to break,

193
0:09:50.100 --> 0:09:51.860
maybe we'll look at Webblade.

194
0:09:51.860 --> 0:09:56.780
And then a horrible bag of shell scripts and pro scripts

195
0:09:56.780 --> 0:10:00.120
and make files that sort of hold it all together,

196
0:10:01.340 --> 0:10:03.720
which again could be replaced by something better.

197
0:10:03.720 --> 0:10:06.620
It's just never really figured out what that could be.

198
0:10:09.060 --> 0:10:12.800
So pros and cons of doing any of this.

199
0:10:12.800 --> 0:10:15.640
One thing I obviously we want to translate

200
0:10:15.640 --> 0:10:16.700
because we want to translate, right?

201
0:10:16.700 --> 0:10:20.520
So that's sort of the ultimate requirement.

202
0:10:20.520 --> 0:10:22.380
But what I found interesting

203
0:10:22.380 --> 0:10:25.900
as a sort of secondary benefits is actually that

204
0:10:28.020 --> 0:10:31.340
by putting all your messages of your programs

205
0:10:31.340 --> 0:10:32.700
through a translation process,

206
0:10:32.700 --> 0:10:36.420
you get an automatic review of every message string.

207
0:10:38.100 --> 0:10:40.540
Because every thing you put in the source code

208
0:10:40.540 --> 0:10:43.780
is looked again later by at least one more person

209
0:10:43.780 --> 0:10:45.860
or several all the translators.

210
0:10:45.860 --> 0:10:49.020
And you catch like typos and stuff like that,

211
0:10:49.020 --> 0:10:50.900
but also if something doesn't make any sense, right?

212
0:10:50.900 --> 0:10:55.420
Maybe some developer wrote it and it makes sense to them,

213
0:10:55.420 --> 0:10:58.420
but then someone else who is not that very developer

214
0:10:58.420 --> 0:10:59.260
looks at it again, it's like,

215
0:10:59.260 --> 0:11:00.740
okay, I don't really understand this.

216
0:11:00.740 --> 0:11:03.220
I can't translate it because I don't understand it.

217
0:11:03.220 --> 0:11:04.760
Or it looks weird, could we look at it again?

218
0:11:04.760 --> 0:11:06.020
So you get this review process

219
0:11:06.020 --> 0:11:10.060
and we've gotten really good in Postgres

220
0:11:11.220 --> 0:11:13.640
about really tuning error messages.

221
0:11:13.640 --> 0:11:15.220
Because it's a complicated piece of software

222
0:11:15.220 --> 0:11:18.420
and you get all these little weird scenarios

223
0:11:18.420 --> 0:11:21.940
with sort of transaction processing

224
0:11:21.940 --> 0:11:24.540
and weird little write ahead log and replication

225
0:11:24.540 --> 0:11:25.660
and all these kinds of things.

226
0:11:25.660 --> 0:11:27.580
And so you wanna be really good and precise

227
0:11:27.580 --> 0:11:30.460
to explain to you, okay, this failed because of this.

228
0:11:30.460 --> 0:11:32.900
And you could try this, but don't try that.

229
0:11:34.800 --> 0:11:36.980
So this is really, I think people appreciate it.

230
0:11:36.980 --> 0:11:38.540
Independent of translation and everything else,

231
0:11:38.540 --> 0:11:39.740
I think people appreciate that.

232
0:11:39.740 --> 0:11:41.740
And this process actually helps that

233
0:11:41.740 --> 0:11:46.380
because you sort of refine your program's messages

234
0:11:46.380 --> 0:11:47.980
through this process as well.

235
0:11:49.940 --> 0:11:51.580
And secondly, actually it also turned out

236
0:11:51.580 --> 0:11:56.180
that sometimes people come in, do some translation,

237
0:11:56.180 --> 0:11:59.520
maybe find a bug or wanna look something up in a source code,

238
0:11:59.520 --> 0:12:01.900
go into the source code and then become a programmer.

239
0:12:01.900 --> 0:12:03.620
So you can also kind of recruit people that way.

240
0:12:03.620 --> 0:12:05.520
It's kind of interesting.

241
0:12:05.520 --> 0:12:10.520
So, but then there are many challenges, right?

242
0:12:15.040 --> 0:12:16.720
So first of all, you wanna get people in there

243
0:12:16.720 --> 0:12:17.880
to use the translation, right?

244
0:12:17.880 --> 0:12:22.880
And it's just this, because Postgres is not sort of,

245
0:12:22.880 --> 0:12:24.640
or similar systems as well, right?

246
0:12:24.640 --> 0:12:26.640
It's not end user facing.

247
0:12:26.640 --> 0:12:29.920
It's not used by sort of random average people, right?

248
0:12:29.920 --> 0:12:33.760
It's used by technically minded people,

249
0:12:33.760 --> 0:12:35.720
experts, database administrators and so on.

250
0:12:35.720 --> 0:12:40.320
So a lot of those people, there's not too much pressure

251
0:12:40.320 --> 0:12:41.600
to actually have things translated.

252
0:12:41.600 --> 0:12:44.720
People will be, okay, it's not translated, it's fine, right?

253
0:12:44.720 --> 0:12:48.320
Which is different from if LibreOffice or Firefox

254
0:12:48.320 --> 0:12:50.000
is not translated and you install it in the school,

255
0:12:50.000 --> 0:12:50.840
it wouldn't work.

256
0:12:50.840 --> 0:12:51.680
It's just, you can't do that, right?

257
0:12:51.680 --> 0:12:55.360
But here it's like, okay, if it's not,

258
0:12:55.360 --> 0:12:57.400
if it doesn't get done, it's not a problem in a way,

259
0:12:57.400 --> 0:13:00.120
but we just wanna do it because we like it.

260
0:13:00.120 --> 0:13:02.080
But if it doesn't get done, it's like, okay,

261
0:13:02.080 --> 0:13:03.000
then we'll just move on, right?

262
0:13:03.000 --> 0:13:07.560
So you gotta kind of, it relies on a lot of enthusiasm,

263
0:13:07.560 --> 0:13:09.000
individual enthusiasm, right?

264
0:13:11.600 --> 0:13:15.240
A lot of the, yeah, I found also, at least personally,

265
0:13:15.240 --> 0:13:17.640
as doing some of the translation work myself,

266
0:13:17.640 --> 0:13:20.560
terminology is hard sometimes, right?

267
0:13:20.560 --> 0:13:23.760
Because again, I just mentioned something like that.

268
0:13:23.760 --> 0:13:26.280
It's not just press this button to download a thing.

269
0:13:26.280 --> 0:13:29.880
Okay, you can translate that in any language probably by now.

270
0:13:29.880 --> 0:13:32.400
But what if you get into terms like, you know,

271
0:13:32.400 --> 0:13:35.520
sub-transaction rollback or incremental

272
0:13:35.520 --> 0:13:38.040
materialized view maintenance, you know?

273
0:13:38.040 --> 0:13:41.320
Some languages might not even have terms for that, maybe.

274
0:13:41.320 --> 0:13:43.200
You know, sometimes when I do the work,

275
0:13:43.200 --> 0:13:46.320
I pick, you know, I have some textbooks,

276
0:13:46.320 --> 0:13:50.480
like academic textbooks in German in my case.

277
0:13:50.480 --> 0:13:53.200
And I just go through them, like, anybody in here

278
0:13:53.200 --> 0:13:54.640
talk about materialized views?

279
0:13:54.640 --> 0:13:56.360
What kind of terminology are they using?

280
0:13:56.360 --> 0:13:59.960
And then I have like six books and three do it this way,

281
0:13:59.960 --> 0:14:02.480
three do it that way, and then I just pick something

282
0:14:02.480 --> 0:14:03.480
at some point, right?

283
0:14:05.160 --> 0:14:08.000
So in some way, we have to kind of define,

284
0:14:08.000 --> 0:14:10.520
make up the terminology in some cases, even, right?

285
0:14:13.640 --> 0:14:18.480
And as I alluded to, the workflow is not as cool

286
0:14:18.480 --> 0:14:20.160
as what we saw in the previous talk,

287
0:14:20.160 --> 0:14:21.640
so maybe we can improve that.

288
0:14:24.480 --> 0:14:26.600
So here's some sort of source code level challenges.

289
0:14:26.600 --> 0:14:31.600
Some of those are solvable, some of those are not.

290
0:14:32.320 --> 0:14:34.280
People who work in translation know about, like,

291
0:14:34.280 --> 0:14:35.400
plural issues, right?

292
0:14:35.400 --> 0:14:36.400
We do handle that.

293
0:14:37.320 --> 0:14:39.400
Works fine, but then if you, I've never figured out

294
0:14:39.400 --> 0:14:40.880
how to handle the first one.

295
0:14:40.880 --> 0:14:45.880
Like, if you have two or more numbers in a sentence,

296
0:14:47.760 --> 0:14:50.520
like, then you would have to have some combinatorial

297
0:14:51.520 --> 0:14:53.880
sort of list of translations.

298
0:14:53.880 --> 0:14:56.080
What if the first one is singular and the last one

299
0:14:56.080 --> 0:14:58.560
is five, and what if the first one is two

300
0:14:58.560 --> 0:15:02.120
and the last one is 18, you know?

301
0:15:02.120 --> 0:15:03.440
I don't think you can really solve that,

302
0:15:03.440 --> 0:15:05.720
then you start rephrasing things in weird ways.

303
0:15:06.840 --> 0:15:08.320
Well, we have the second one, which obviously

304
0:15:08.320 --> 0:15:11.080
everybody knows you shouldn't do, if you sort of

305
0:15:11.080 --> 0:15:13.480
paste terms together, that doesn't work, right?

306
0:15:13.480 --> 0:15:15.880
Let's say you're just gonna make something up,

307
0:15:15.880 --> 0:15:18.560
like, you cannot apply a generation expression

308
0:15:18.560 --> 0:15:20.760
to a materialized view, let's say, something like that.

309
0:15:20.760 --> 0:15:23.480
That's a thing that could happen in Postgres,

310
0:15:23.480 --> 0:15:24.560
more or less, right?

311
0:15:24.560 --> 0:15:27.280
It's like, okay, you shouldn't do that,

312
0:15:27.280 --> 0:15:29.000
you shouldn't sort of stick that into the middle

313
0:15:29.000 --> 0:15:30.360
of the sentence because then the grammar

314
0:15:30.360 --> 0:15:33.520
doesn't match in some languages.

315
0:15:34.360 --> 0:15:35.600
So you write those out.

316
0:15:36.720 --> 0:15:39.400
But what if you have, like, five options here

317
0:15:39.400 --> 0:15:40.560
and six options there?

318
0:15:40.560 --> 0:15:43.160
Are you gonna make 30 strings in your source code?

319
0:15:45.040 --> 0:15:47.200
At some point, probably not, right?

320
0:15:47.200 --> 0:15:52.200
So, at some point then, developers,

321
0:15:52.200 --> 0:15:55.000
the actual developers do get annoyed if you tell them,

322
0:15:55.000 --> 0:15:56.760
like, no, you can't do that, you have to write

323
0:15:56.760 --> 0:15:58.600
actually 35 error messages by hand,

324
0:15:58.600 --> 0:16:00.320
so not gonna do that.

325
0:16:00.320 --> 0:16:04.480
So in some cases, we did have 20 messages for some stuff

326
0:16:04.480 --> 0:16:07.440
and we had to rephrase so that we only had

327
0:16:07.440 --> 0:16:08.680
the number of answers.

328
0:16:08.680 --> 0:16:13.280
You start then tweaking it, can you say something,

329
0:16:13.280 --> 0:16:15.880
something, semicolon, something, something,

330
0:16:15.880 --> 0:16:18.040
and then maybe at that point it's okay, I don't know,

331
0:16:18.040 --> 0:16:19.660
but yeah, exactly.

332
0:16:19.660 --> 0:16:23.660
So you have to make, use some judgment calls in these cases.

333
0:16:26.160 --> 0:16:27.760
One thing that sometimes happens if developers

334
0:16:27.760 --> 0:16:30.160
add a new file to source code, then it has to be added

335
0:16:30.160 --> 0:16:32.680
somewhere else also to make sure the translation system

336
0:16:32.680 --> 0:16:35.760
catches it and that sometimes gets forgotten.

337
0:16:35.760 --> 0:16:37.280
It's just one of those things, I don't know

338
0:16:37.280 --> 0:16:40.640
if there's a solution for that, you just gotta do it.

339
0:16:40.640 --> 0:16:42.820
There's also some weird thing, we have, like, files

340
0:16:42.820 --> 0:16:44.880
that get compiled into multiple components

341
0:16:44.880 --> 0:16:48.960
and then you kind of have to add them to all of those

342
0:16:48.960 --> 0:16:53.400
components and retranslate everything in each component

343
0:16:53.400 --> 0:16:55.600
which could be handled with some of those translation

344
0:16:55.600 --> 0:16:57.680
memory things and stuff like that, but it's just kind of

345
0:16:57.680 --> 0:17:02.680
weird the way we have it laid out and kind of makes it annoying.

346
0:17:05.560 --> 0:17:10.560
Yeah, so this is maybe specific to something like,

347
0:17:12.720 --> 0:17:16.000
postcodes being A, a client server system, B, a database,

348
0:17:16.000 --> 0:17:20.520
and C having its own sort of ideas about what encoding

349
0:17:20.520 --> 0:17:23.080
on locale and stuff like that means, right?

350
0:17:23.080 --> 0:17:28.080
So in, you know, a database stores data which is often text

351
0:17:30.180 --> 0:17:35.180
which has encoding and because of, you know, nowadays

352
0:17:37.680 --> 0:17:40.740
you think everything's UTF-8, but in a database

353
0:17:40.740 --> 0:17:42.280
you can also store things in other encodings

354
0:17:42.280 --> 0:17:45.420
for historical reasons, but, or in some cases

355
0:17:45.420 --> 0:17:48.540
because UTF-8 doesn't actually match what doesn't support

356
0:17:48.540 --> 0:17:51.680
what you want to store which sounds maybe bizarre

357
0:17:51.680 --> 0:17:54.880
but happens especially in sort of Japanese

358
0:17:54.880 --> 0:17:58.360
and things like that, so we do support automatic encoding

359
0:17:58.360 --> 0:18:01.340
conversion between client and server so that all works

360
0:18:01.340 --> 0:18:06.340
and happens, but then this also, what if you have,

361
0:18:06.960 --> 0:18:08.580
you know, your strings, your translated strings

362
0:18:08.580 --> 0:18:10.700
or in a file, they also have an encoding,

363
0:18:10.700 --> 0:18:13.200
they then get loaded into the server process,

364
0:18:13.200 --> 0:18:16.280
the server process, prints stuff to its own log

365
0:18:16.280 --> 0:18:18.980
but also sends error messages to the client.

366
0:18:18.980 --> 0:18:22.080
All of those things could have different ideas

367
0:18:22.080 --> 0:18:22.920
of what they want, right?

368
0:18:22.920 --> 0:18:26.280
You might want to log stuff in English to your server log

369
0:18:26.280 --> 0:18:30.280
but the client wants the error message in French,

370
0:18:30.280 --> 0:18:33.320
but, or for some, it maybe it's like legacy client

371
0:18:33.320 --> 0:18:37.360
that wants it, you know, transcoded to Latin nine

372
0:18:39.320 --> 0:18:41.440
or, and then at the same time there's a different client

373
0:18:41.440 --> 0:18:43.560
connected that also is doing things

374
0:18:43.560 --> 0:18:45.680
and is sent to a different language,

375
0:18:45.680 --> 0:18:47.520
you want to log it to the same server log

376
0:18:47.520 --> 0:18:49.080
in the same language and the same encoding

377
0:18:49.080 --> 0:18:50.440
hopefully as the other guy.

378
0:18:51.360 --> 0:18:56.360
All of this works quite poorly the way the get text

379
0:18:56.760 --> 0:19:01.760
or the INTL APIs work, you can sort of have some subsets

380
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:03.960
with this working but if you really try hard,

381
0:19:03.960 --> 0:19:07.040
it's a total mess and it just basically doesn't work.

382
0:19:07.040 --> 0:19:10.480
And so that's a real problem really

383
0:19:10.480 --> 0:19:15.480
and we'd have to really redesign some of this

384
0:19:15.800 --> 0:19:18.160
to support all of these combinations.

385
0:19:20.600 --> 0:19:25.600
Yeah, also the tools, well the tools are fine,

386
0:19:27.440 --> 0:19:31.520
they're actually quite cool and get text has some internal

387
0:19:31.520 --> 0:19:34.320
sort of optimizations that are quite interesting,

388
0:19:34.320 --> 0:19:36.200
has like sort of internal parallelization

389
0:19:36.200 --> 0:19:37.920
and stuff like that so work has been done

390
0:19:37.920 --> 0:19:40.560
but I still find it quite slow, you know,

391
0:19:41.480 --> 0:19:45.280
even on our scale I'm interested to see what the KDE report

392
0:19:47.280 --> 0:19:48.760
is gonna be later on how they handle that

393
0:19:48.760 --> 0:19:50.840
but it is still quite slow, right?

394
0:19:50.840 --> 0:19:52.640
This sort of website thing I showed,

395
0:19:52.640 --> 0:19:54.640
if you just do a full rebuild of that,

396
0:19:54.640 --> 0:19:56.520
it takes like 20 minutes or something, right?

397
0:19:56.520 --> 0:19:59.320
Just to re-merge and re-extract and recombine everything.

398
0:19:59.320 --> 0:20:06.320
So also the format, the PO format is sort of pre-source control,

399
0:20:11.760 --> 0:20:14.880
I find, because it has all these like dates

400
0:20:14.880 --> 0:20:16.880
and time stems in it and which you don't need

401
0:20:16.880 --> 0:20:18.760
because you have it in your source control management

402
0:20:18.760 --> 0:20:21.680
but these, hello.

403
0:20:21.680 --> 0:20:23.720
Can you be more explicit on the 20 minutes?

404
0:20:23.720 --> 0:20:25.720
What do you do in these 20 minutes

405
0:20:25.720 --> 0:20:27.240
because it sounds very slow?

406
0:20:27.240 --> 0:20:31.400
Well, it runs a loop, it extracts,

407
0:20:32.480 --> 0:20:35.520
runs xgettext over the source code

408
0:20:37.600 --> 0:20:42.280
and then it runs message merge against all these catalogs

409
0:20:43.480 --> 0:20:46.000
which are, you know, sort of this many by that many

410
0:20:47.160 --> 0:20:48.720
times that many branches

411
0:20:50.200 --> 0:20:55.280
and you run that on just a machine, right?

412
0:20:55.280 --> 0:20:57.760
So, I mean, you could optimize this

413
0:20:57.760 --> 0:20:59.440
by maybe a beefier machine

414
0:20:59.440 --> 0:21:01.680
and you can probably parallelize this a little bit

415
0:21:01.680 --> 0:21:04.520
but it's still, you know, the main message catalog

416
0:21:04.520 --> 0:21:07.120
for the actual server has like, you know, 5,000 strings

417
0:21:07.120 --> 0:21:09.720
and that is still gonna run like,

418
0:21:11.520 --> 0:21:14.560
I don't really know why but it runs like a couple of minutes.

419
0:21:15.440 --> 0:21:19.760
It's just, it's not, we're doing this build system work now,

420
0:21:19.760 --> 0:21:22.840
right, when we go from make to mason or mason or ninja

421
0:21:22.840 --> 0:21:27.520
because make is too slow

422
0:21:27.520 --> 0:21:29.920
even if you don't have to do anything, right?

423
0:21:29.920 --> 0:21:32.560
So we're trying to sort of go from,

424
0:21:32.560 --> 0:21:34.800
I can rebuild everything in five seconds to two seconds

425
0:21:34.800 --> 0:21:36.080
and this thing takes like 10 minutes

426
0:21:36.080 --> 0:21:38.080
so that's just kind of annoying, right?

427
0:21:40.440 --> 0:21:42.200
Yeah, and I mentioned sort of the back patching,

428
0:21:42.200 --> 0:21:46.400
sort of you, oftentimes what happens is that

429
0:21:46.400 --> 0:21:47.800
there's like a bug fix, right?

430
0:21:47.800 --> 0:21:51.760
And because of the bug fix, there's a new message changes

431
0:21:51.760 --> 0:21:54.400
and one new one is added and then,

432
0:21:54.400 --> 0:21:59.080
so that then pops up in your website

433
0:21:59.080 --> 0:22:01.280
but then it gets back patched,

434
0:22:01.280 --> 0:22:02.640
the same bug fix gets back patched

435
0:22:02.640 --> 0:22:05.080
so the same message has to then also be updated

436
0:22:05.080 --> 0:22:07.080
in the back branches so you just kind of

437
0:22:08.000 --> 0:22:09.640
have to like download this, upload this,

438
0:22:09.640 --> 0:22:11.360
then it gets added to the translation memory,

439
0:22:11.360 --> 0:22:13.320
then you can do this, I have a bunch of shell scripts

440
0:22:13.320 --> 0:22:16.320
to kind of make this work, it's just all, could be better.

441
0:22:16.320 --> 0:22:21.320
All right, so a lot of people know this chart here.

442
0:22:27.520 --> 0:22:32.520
So, you know, some of the projects that we know,

443
0:22:33.320 --> 0:22:34.740
maybe Postgres is somewhere in here,

444
0:22:34.740 --> 0:22:36.680
KDE, LibreOffice, they're all pretty good

445
0:22:36.680 --> 0:22:39.680
but then there's maybe things like that down here

446
0:22:39.680 --> 0:22:44.680
that everybody builds on but they're sort of maintained by,

447
0:22:44.680 --> 0:22:48.920
by a few people in there sort of on the side, right?

448
0:22:48.920 --> 0:22:53.440
And this way, I mean, this is sort of a general problem.

449
0:22:53.440 --> 0:22:57.440
I gave the same, I gave a talk,

450
0:22:57.440 --> 0:22:59.560
it was the online one two years ago

451
0:22:59.560 --> 0:23:02.160
about the documentation tool chain Postgres,

452
0:23:02.160 --> 0:23:04.100
same problem, right?

453
0:23:05.640 --> 0:23:07.760
We have, you know, open source,

454
0:23:07.760 --> 0:23:09.400
everything's very successful but then there's like

455
0:23:09.400 --> 0:23:12.280
these little tools you need just to make your build run,

456
0:23:12.280 --> 0:23:16.560
right, and then there's, they don't have the same

457
0:23:16.560 --> 0:23:19.000
necessarily amount of staffing and funding

458
0:23:19.000 --> 0:23:21.280
and things like that but you still kind of rely on them

459
0:23:21.280 --> 0:23:22.840
and they just barely sort of chug along.

460
0:23:22.840 --> 0:23:27.280
So, that's a sort of general concern, right?

461
0:23:27.280 --> 0:23:28.600
But it's, it applies here.

462
0:23:30.760 --> 0:23:32.360
All right, so what are we doing?

463
0:23:33.840 --> 0:23:34.680
What do we plan to do?

464
0:23:34.680 --> 0:23:36.520
I mentioned we're in the middle, right now,

465
0:23:36.520 --> 0:23:38.480
we're sort of redoing our build system

466
0:23:38.480 --> 0:23:43.480
that is kind of a good reason to clean up some of that

467
0:23:45.160 --> 0:23:47.000
old stuff that we don't need anymore.

468
0:23:47.000 --> 0:23:50.000
We're also moving more to using ICU which is, you know,

469
0:23:50.000 --> 0:23:55.000
internationalization library that does lots of good things

470
0:23:56.200 --> 0:24:00.360
but then it adds another dimension to this issue of,

471
0:24:00.360 --> 0:24:02.120
you know, locale encoding and then there's sort of

472
0:24:02.120 --> 0:24:04.520
another dimension of what ICU thinks the current locale

473
0:24:04.520 --> 0:24:07.640
and encoding is, it just gets ever more messy

474
0:24:07.640 --> 0:24:12.240
and complicated and then one sort of important issue

475
0:24:12.240 --> 0:24:14.080
in databases is the sort order, right?

476
0:24:14.080 --> 0:24:15.440
That's a lot of people care about that,

477
0:24:15.440 --> 0:24:17.160
what the sort order of your data is

478
0:24:17.160 --> 0:24:20.280
and different collations have to be supported

479
0:24:20.280 --> 0:24:24.360
and that's another kind of sort of localization

480
0:24:24.360 --> 0:24:26.120
kind of work we do.

481
0:24:26.120 --> 0:24:28.240
But all of this is sort of weirdly connector, right?

482
0:24:28.240 --> 0:24:31.040
If you configure one part of the system to be

483
0:24:31.040 --> 0:24:33.000
in this language then all of a sudden get text

484
0:24:33.000 --> 0:24:34.960
also thinks that this is the same but maybe

485
0:24:34.960 --> 0:24:35.880
you don't even want that, right?

486
0:24:35.880 --> 0:24:38.240
You might want to error messages in French

487
0:24:38.240 --> 0:24:40.240
but you want to sort something in Swedish, right?

488
0:24:40.240 --> 0:24:41.400
That's why not.

489
0:24:42.440 --> 0:24:46.520
But because of these APIs the way they're historically built

490
0:24:46.520 --> 0:24:49.460
it just doesn't quite work smoothly.

491
0:24:52.760 --> 0:24:56.440
But again, we want to modernize the workflows.

492
0:24:56.440 --> 0:24:58.000
Again, maybe web late.

493
0:24:58.000 --> 0:25:00.640
I heard of Omega T here also this weekend

494
0:25:00.640 --> 0:25:03.440
and there's Crowdin but,

495
0:25:03.440 --> 0:25:08.440
so the issue I had, I mean I heard of Web late

496
0:25:08.480 --> 0:25:11.320
some years ago too but again the issue is sort of

497
0:25:11.320 --> 0:25:14.480
we can't just adopt like the hottest new thing, right?

498
0:25:14.480 --> 0:25:17.480
Because again, whatever the way I always think about it

499
0:25:17.480 --> 0:25:22.160
is whatever I sort of do today in Postgres, right?

500
0:25:22.160 --> 0:25:24.440
Some piece of code or make some infrastructure change

501
0:25:24.440 --> 0:25:27.440
still has to work in 10 years, right?

502
0:25:27.440 --> 0:25:29.800
And it doesn't, meaning it also has to like build

503
0:25:29.800 --> 0:25:30.640
from source, right?

504
0:25:30.640 --> 0:25:32.340
Because that's the way open source works, right?

505
0:25:32.340 --> 0:25:36.560
So I can't just use a tool that was just invented yesterday

506
0:25:36.560 --> 0:25:38.520
and I don't know if it's still gonna be here in two years.

507
0:25:38.520 --> 0:25:42.000
Now they mentioned Web late is 11 years old

508
0:25:42.000 --> 0:25:44.800
so that's pretty good so I think we can maybe look into that.

509
0:25:46.800 --> 0:25:49.440
All right, so this is something maybe a question

510
0:25:49.440 --> 0:25:52.240
anybody knows is GetX still the thing

511
0:25:52.240 --> 0:25:53.760
or is it something totally different

512
0:25:53.760 --> 0:25:54.880
that everybody should be using now

513
0:25:54.880 --> 0:25:58.880
as part of those sort of the low level API of how this works?

514
0:25:58.880 --> 0:26:00.840
I don't know.

515
0:26:00.840 --> 0:26:05.400
Well, sort of half hoping that's from the ICU ecosystem

516
0:26:05.400 --> 0:26:07.680
something would be evolving or it's sort of emerging

517
0:26:07.680 --> 0:26:08.880
but I haven't seen anything like that

518
0:26:08.880 --> 0:26:10.480
so I don't know if there's anything

519
0:26:12.280 --> 0:26:14.080
or is this still the thing to use?

520
0:26:14.080 --> 0:26:15.080
I don't know.

521
0:26:15.080 --> 0:26:17.480
So maybe somebody has a, yes, please.

522
0:26:17.480 --> 0:26:21.720
The ICU upcoming solution is Mesut format two.

523
0:26:21.720 --> 0:26:26.720
It's currently in the ICU4J72 that came out in October

524
0:26:26.720 --> 0:26:30.960
and it's in tech preview there but it's gonna progress

525
0:26:30.960 --> 0:26:33.720
from there it's not yet in ICU4C.

526
0:26:34.680 --> 0:26:36.880
It's effectively Mesut format two

527
0:26:36.880 --> 0:26:40.080
is a new Mesut format syntax.

528
0:26:40.920 --> 0:26:43.120
The resource level syntax for that

529
0:26:43.120 --> 0:26:46.120
is a little bit more still in progress

530
0:26:46.120 --> 0:26:49.720
but if you're moving towards more of an ICU world

531
0:26:49.720 --> 0:26:54.000
that's likely going to provide a decent future thing

532
0:26:54.000 --> 0:26:56.480
for you to migrate to from GetX.

533
0:26:56.480 --> 0:26:59.800
It's not that yet but it's becoming that.

534
0:26:59.800 --> 0:27:02.400
That is excellent news.

535
0:27:02.400 --> 0:27:04.400
Thank you, I'll definitely look into that.

536
0:27:12.200 --> 0:27:14.880
Webulate is adopting that as well or supporting that?

537
0:27:14.880 --> 0:27:16.640
It's all compatible.

538
0:27:17.520 --> 0:27:19.600
It seems like it supported a bunch of things.

539
0:27:19.600 --> 0:27:22.360
So yeah, this is wonderful and useful information

540
0:27:22.360 --> 0:27:23.200
we can like.

541
0:27:23.200 --> 0:27:24.880
No message format two.

542
0:27:24.880 --> 0:27:25.720
It does.

543
0:27:25.720 --> 0:27:26.560
It's not there yet.

544
0:27:26.560 --> 0:27:29.360
The specifications are two-point-four.

545
0:27:29.360 --> 0:27:32.280
So yeah, this is good, thank you.

546
0:27:32.280 --> 0:27:35.440
So this is also the end of my presentation.

547
0:27:35.440 --> 0:27:38.840
So I just wanted to sort of say what we're doing

548
0:27:38.840 --> 0:27:40.920
and what sort of the some of the unique challenges are.

549
0:27:40.920 --> 0:27:42.200
I've got some good feedback here.

550
0:27:42.200 --> 0:27:43.560
I'm gonna look into Weblate.

551
0:27:43.560 --> 0:27:48.560
We're gonna look into sort of emerging ICU things,

552
0:27:49.560 --> 0:27:51.200
update some of our infrastructure.

553
0:27:52.720 --> 0:27:55.080
We have a few minutes for questions.

554
0:27:55.080 --> 0:27:57.400
Otherwise, thank you very much for listening.

555
0:27:57.400 --> 0:27:58.240
Yeah.

556
0:27:58.240 --> 0:28:00.920
So if you're worried about Weblate,

557
0:28:05.840 --> 0:28:07.880
it doesn't really interact with,

558
0:28:09.280 --> 0:28:12.160
it doesn't go to the new automation system

559
0:28:12.160 --> 0:28:16.240
because the way you communicate with Weblate

560
0:28:16.240 --> 0:28:19.200
with the world and the translators is files.

561
0:28:19.200 --> 0:28:24.200
Yeah.

562
0:28:39.920 --> 0:28:41.040
Yeah, it sounds like it.

563
0:28:41.040 --> 0:28:51.800
Yeah, it was kind of funny

564
0:28:51.800 --> 0:28:54.400
because I had submitted various bugs

565
0:28:54.400 --> 0:28:57.040
to savannah.new.org over the years.

566
0:28:57.040 --> 0:28:59.720
Also feature requests and stuff like that.

567
0:28:59.720 --> 0:29:03.640
And it just like two or three weeks ago,

568
0:29:03.640 --> 0:29:05.200
all of these bugs were like updated

569
0:29:05.200 --> 0:29:06.520
and some of them closed and it's like,

570
0:29:06.520 --> 0:29:09.720
whoa, somebody know that I'm gonna complain

571
0:29:09.720 --> 0:29:10.920
about them at first.

572
0:29:10.920 --> 0:29:11.760
I don't know.

573
0:29:11.760 --> 0:29:13.000
Is the person here in any case?

574
0:29:13.000 --> 0:29:14.480
I don't know who is, no.

575
0:29:16.520 --> 0:29:18.920
Well, I guess it's just sort of,

576
0:29:18.920 --> 0:29:21.760
I mean, this is a problem or I guess it is a problem

577
0:29:21.760 --> 0:29:24.600
in sort of some of these people maintain

578
0:29:24.600 --> 0:29:25.920
some of these specially new tools

579
0:29:25.920 --> 0:29:26.880
and some of these older tools

580
0:29:26.880 --> 0:29:28.160
that are sort of on maintenance.

581
0:29:28.160 --> 0:29:30.160
I mean, we don't need tons of new features,

582
0:29:30.160 --> 0:29:32.560
but you don't really know, right?

583
0:29:32.560 --> 0:29:34.360
It could just be that that person changed his job

584
0:29:34.360 --> 0:29:37.440
and then nothing happens again for five years, right?

585
0:29:37.440 --> 0:29:40.920
But well, got some good new information here, thank you.

586
0:29:40.920 --> 0:30:06.920
All right, then we'll move on to the next one.
