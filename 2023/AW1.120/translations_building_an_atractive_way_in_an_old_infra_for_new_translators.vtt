WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
Okay. Hi folks.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.360
Thanks for this talk.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.840
I wanted also to thanks for them and

00:12.840 --> 00:16.980
the organizers here for this Dev Room because I'm very happy

00:16.980 --> 00:20.160
that the translation to make part of

00:20.160 --> 00:23.000
the topics in such important events.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.520
So it's a very good news, I think.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.640
Well, I wanted to propose this talk because,

00:29.640 --> 00:32.760
well, personally, I have

00:32.760 --> 00:36.920
started Free Software in 2004 and I have

00:36.920 --> 00:41.240
done some contributions to the Debian project for a long time.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.480
But I only started translation in this project.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.080
I have started that since 2018.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.960
Well, I told myself,

00:52.960 --> 00:58.080
how could we help new contributors,

00:58.080 --> 01:01.600
new users, new potential commerce to help

01:01.600 --> 01:05.200
the translations team with

01:05.200 --> 01:08.720
the capabilities that Debian can provide for them,

01:08.720 --> 01:12.280
and also with what Debian can't provide.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.200
It's also what we're going to see and we're going to see why.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.640
It's not so easy actually.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.960
So I told myself also,

01:19.960 --> 01:23.360
well, I'm sure some people think that,

01:23.360 --> 01:25.440
oh, but why Debian doesn't choose

01:25.440 --> 01:30.640
modern tools such as woodlates or such as model for editors,

01:30.640 --> 01:32.880
or things like that.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.760
So I had the thought about that.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.640
I told myself, well,

01:37.640 --> 01:40.680
why not share that with people to

01:40.680 --> 01:43.840
understand why Debian works like that and how

01:43.840 --> 01:49.920
a new user could contribute with this way of working.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.400
We thought no problem and we had problems.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.160
Well, we've had this faction.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.480
So the example I take is of course,

01:59.480 --> 02:02.760
this is a French translation team because it's the team,

02:02.760 --> 02:05.120
I know the best of course.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.920
It's a very small team.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.520
It's a very, very small team as you see,

02:10.520 --> 02:12.640
there are few people.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.560
There have been people for a long time,

02:15.560 --> 02:19.800
but it's never a team with 10 or 20 persons.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.800
No, it's a very, very small team.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.880
Also, it's not a team which have a lot of technical skills.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.080
I mean, there are some Debian developers,

02:30.080 --> 02:33.640
but which were technical,

02:33.640 --> 02:35.560
there are one or two.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.480
Most other Debian developers of this team are not uploaders.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.480
That is, they are not considered,

02:43.480 --> 02:46.200
or they're not considered themselves able to do

02:46.200 --> 02:48.560
uploads of new packages or things like that.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.880
So it's not a technical team.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.880
It's really a translation team and not a technical team.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.520
And amazing results are produced by this team.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.480
I mean that it's a very small team,

03:03.480 --> 03:05.560
but very amazing results exist.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.480
For example, we have all the things we translate

03:11.480 --> 03:15.200
and we know that we are the third language

03:15.200 --> 03:17.640
best translated in the project.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.520
And when we see the amount of work which is needed

03:21.520 --> 03:25.440
to get that, I think the team may be very happy.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.120
And I can say it because I don't make part of all the team

03:30.120 --> 03:32.120
and I don't make part of all these projects,

03:32.120 --> 03:34.840
so congratulations to other members of the staff.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.880
So the websites, the installer,

03:38.880 --> 03:41.040
all the things which are translated

03:41.040 --> 03:44.600
from up to nearly 100%,

03:44.600 --> 03:49.600
the Debian package descriptions, which are not translated,

03:49.880 --> 03:54.560
of course, very much, but the most important are translated

03:54.560 --> 03:56.840
and it's very important for us also

03:56.840 --> 04:00.680
to enable French users to get the package description,

04:00.680 --> 04:03.800
at least for those they have more chance to use.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.640
So I think it's very, an amazing result

04:08.640 --> 04:13.640
when we know the real size of the team.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.680
Then we work for a project

04:18.680 --> 04:23.440
which has been a very long history, as you know.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.320
The first message, I was very happy to discover that,

04:27.320 --> 04:28.680
preparing this talk.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.640
The first message of the Debian translation team

04:31.640 --> 04:36.120
for French is in 1998, it's very old.

04:36.120 --> 04:41.000
The world has changed very much since this year, of course,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.320
and in particular, the technical world.

04:43.320 --> 04:48.160
So of course, the process, the workflow,

04:48.160 --> 04:50.360
is made based today.

04:50.360 --> 04:54.760
And we have webpages, webpages which enable

04:54.760 --> 04:57.800
to have a tracking of the situations

04:57.800 --> 05:00.800
and to have some statistics and to have some information,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.960
some bots who automate some things

05:03.960 --> 05:07.720
and also some statistics and some made based

05:07.720 --> 05:11.080
to have a workflow between the members of the team

05:11.080 --> 05:14.800
to ensure that the translation has a good quality.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.680
The tools, as I said, are made based.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.480
That is, on the Debian mailing list,

05:25.480 --> 05:29.320
the Debian mailing list for the team, the French team,

05:29.320 --> 05:36.320
there is a bot who is able to receive the topics,

05:36.320 --> 05:39.880
the subject of the messages sent by the member of the list,

05:39.880 --> 05:44.840
to pass them and to produce statistics from this

05:44.840 --> 05:48.800
and to produce some status of the packages or the pages we

05:48.800 --> 05:51.440
are translating.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.920
So it's very important, of course,

05:52.920 --> 05:56.560
because it enables all the members of the team

05:56.560 --> 06:00.520
to know if, for example, someone is working on something

06:00.520 --> 06:03.800
or the status of something, if it's up to date,

06:03.800 --> 06:08.760
or if it's not up to date, or other information like that.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.560
So the thing, of course, is, well, what

06:14.560 --> 06:17.480
can we do with the made based process,

06:17.480 --> 06:20.280
given the number of things we have to do?

06:20.280 --> 06:23.120
Well, we track the changes, so it's very important.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.400
We can know the status of the translations.

06:27.400 --> 06:32.160
And even if we've stopped working for a long time,

06:32.160 --> 06:35.480
we are able, easily, to join the team again

06:35.480 --> 06:40.320
and to know what the situation and what about the situation.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.280
There are also coordination pages,

06:43.280 --> 06:47.880
so with the tracking pages, which enable to do that.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.280
So we have the analysis for the websites.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.400
We have the package translated.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.960
We are, via profiles, packages are translated,

06:57.960 --> 07:01.440
because they are classical programs.

07:01.440 --> 07:06.280
So they use get text as many programs today.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.360
Also descriptions of the depth core screens.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.080
Depth core files, of course, the screens

07:11.080 --> 07:13.400
that the user gets when he's installing a package

07:13.400 --> 07:16.600
to set some configuration at the installation time.

07:16.600 --> 07:20.960
And the website, of course, which is a very high work.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.200
So I think the problem of the Debian project

07:26.200 --> 07:29.880
and the reason for which it's probably very difficult

07:29.880 --> 07:37.840
to use automated tools is that there is a lot of formats

07:37.840 --> 07:43.560
which are used as inputs and also outputs.

07:43.560 --> 07:48.960
I mean, inputs, we have at least a package description database,

07:48.960 --> 07:50.080
which has some formats.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.240
I'm not sure I know what it is about,

07:52.240 --> 07:56.400
but it's not a format such as profiles or HTML files.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.480
It's another kind of format.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.320
It's a database.

07:59.320 --> 08:02.520
HTML, of course, and the profiles.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.400
And for the outputs, we need to produce, of course,

08:06.400 --> 08:09.200
some translations, some typical translations

08:09.200 --> 08:12.960
we find in any other kind of programs of the free software,

08:12.960 --> 08:16.440
but also the websites, so HTML pages.

08:16.440 --> 08:21.040
And various other formats, so it's

08:21.040 --> 08:26.720
not so easy to ship that in a kind of automated tool

08:26.720 --> 08:33.480
because it's really a really quite big task of administration

08:33.480 --> 08:35.280
to set that initially.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.440
And I remember that in the team, we

08:37.440 --> 08:39.360
have not a lot of technical skills,

08:39.360 --> 08:42.880
and we are not very numerous.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.160
So we can understand that we prefer going out with mails,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.720
even if it's probably not perfect,

08:49.720 --> 08:52.680
but at least it enables people to work.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.200
While changing to another kind of tools,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.720
even if it would have benefits about the interface

08:57.720 --> 09:02.360
and the user experience, it would be really a challenge,

09:02.360 --> 09:04.840
a very important challenge.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.680
So changing is very difficult. Is it a good idea also?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.400
It's an idea that the team wonders sometimes.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.200
Is it a good idea?

09:16.840 --> 09:19.440
We wonder that in particular because that's right.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.840
There are not a lot of new contributors

09:22.840 --> 09:26.720
if we have a look annually.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.800
However, when people come and contribute

09:28.800 --> 09:32.480
to the translation projects in Debian, they stay with us.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.840
They don't leave us.

09:33.840 --> 09:38.680
So probably it means that once we manage to adopt the tools,

09:38.680 --> 09:42.440
to adopt the process, we like it,

09:42.440 --> 09:45.200
and people are comfortable with it.

09:45.200 --> 09:53.840
So even if it's not modern, once you take the care to learn it,

09:53.840 --> 09:57.160
at the end, I think we can be comfortable with that.

09:57.160 --> 10:04.080
In particular because, well, we can get things offline.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.360
In particular because we can take the poor

10:07.360 --> 10:10.600
and do some stupid things without being sure you are not

10:10.600 --> 10:12.800
breaking all of the process or you are not breaking

10:12.800 --> 10:14.720
all the translation of others.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.120
So I think it gives some benefits

10:17.120 --> 10:20.720
that people are happy to have.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.360
And that's the reason for which moving is difficult

10:24.360 --> 10:26.440
because people are happy.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.960
And we are not absolutely sure that changing that

10:28.960 --> 10:32.000
would be a good idea.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.400
And when we try changing, for example,

10:34.400 --> 10:38.200
we tried to migrate the server for the package description

10:38.200 --> 10:41.080
to another server in Debian, it takes some year

10:41.080 --> 10:42.840
and it exhausted some people.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.840
So I'm not sure it's the best idea we can have,

10:46.840 --> 10:49.480
even if this migration was really important.

10:49.480 --> 10:54.560
But imagine if we should have a migration with more impact

10:54.560 --> 10:57.760
and more things to address.

10:57.760 --> 11:04.080
So instead of changing things, I suggest

11:04.080 --> 11:08.640
to propose to the users, to the new contributors,

11:08.640 --> 11:16.040
a kind of approach which enable everyone to, well,

11:16.040 --> 11:17.280
let's discover the project.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.280
Let's discover the interactions you can have with the team

11:20.280 --> 11:23.560
from the easiest to the most complex.

11:23.560 --> 11:29.240
And from these bases, do your way.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.320
Follow your way.

11:30.320 --> 11:37.040
And the first step, for example, is for,

11:37.040 --> 11:39.320
and also, yes, on every step of the way,

11:39.320 --> 11:42.120
the idea is also to have two kinds of status.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.720
So two kinds of status, we are going

11:43.720 --> 11:45.520
to talk about that again in a few minutes.

11:45.520 --> 11:50.840
But it's more or less, OK, either I am a reviewer

11:50.840 --> 11:53.840
and I start to understand all the conventions of the team,

11:53.840 --> 11:59.600
how the team works, et cetera, or I become a translator myself.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.880
And of course, I start to contribute

12:01.880 --> 12:04.360
with other translators.

12:04.360 --> 12:12.440
So it's a way to contribute for the rhythm of everybody.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.520
I suggest that the first thing you can do if you want

12:14.520 --> 12:17.520
to contribute, because, again, there

12:17.520 --> 12:19.800
are not some tools which are attractive,

12:19.800 --> 12:22.680
but also start with the easy thing.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.280
And translating the wiki pages of Debian, for example,

12:25.280 --> 12:28.880
would be an easy thing, because much people

12:28.880 --> 12:30.440
love to use a wiki.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.760
It's not so difficult to use.

12:32.760 --> 12:38.040
And using a wiki today is, well, OK, you take the page,

12:38.040 --> 12:39.800
you cut and paste the contents, you

12:39.800 --> 12:43.560
create a new page of the French wiki, and well, and it's done.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.480
So it's not so complicated to do.

12:45.480 --> 12:50.880
And it's the first step which, well,

12:50.880 --> 12:56.160
creates a kind of initiation training for the translation.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.200
We saw so much consequences for the project,

12:58.200 --> 13:01.960
because it's not an official resource,

13:01.960 --> 13:03.320
but it's a community resource.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.600
It's not a resource maintained by Debian members,

13:06.600 --> 13:10.480
so it's not a big problem if you do some mistakes or things

13:10.480 --> 13:12.680
like that.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.880
The next step is probably the package descriptions.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.360
It's interesting, because there are a lot of responsibilities,

13:19.360 --> 13:21.040
because, well, package descriptions

13:21.040 --> 13:23.920
are what users will see on their screen

13:23.920 --> 13:26.360
when they will search for a package.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.680
However, the interface is simple.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.720
It's a web interface, which is wild.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.840
There are some conventions.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.200
There are some rules to have.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.200
But there are also a first contact

13:36.200 --> 13:38.120
with the translation team.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.160
And it's something which is important,

13:40.160 --> 13:43.680
because we have people who review what you're doing.

13:43.680 --> 13:48.160
So you can do what you do, what Debian used to do.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.840
And for example, if you try to translate some things like that,

13:50.840 --> 13:53.480
but Debian is used to translate differently,

13:53.480 --> 13:54.600
you will know that.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.600
If you're not compliant with some kind of syntax

13:58.600 --> 14:01.800
or kind of a way to introduce things,

14:01.800 --> 14:04.320
it will be said by the member of the team.

14:04.320 --> 14:08.280
So it's a first responsibility, a first contact with the team,

14:08.280 --> 14:10.560
but it's a simple interface without needing

14:10.560 --> 14:12.400
to understand something.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.600
So I think it's very interesting for that,

14:14.600 --> 14:17.240
because it's a good point of beginning.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.720
And especially what I like in the package description tools

14:21.720 --> 14:23.960
is that it's very short.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.440
At least you take some packages, such as LaTeX,

14:27.440 --> 14:29.480
or of course LaTeX, when you start

14:29.480 --> 14:32.840
translating the description of LaTeX packages,

14:32.840 --> 14:34.200
it's less fun.

14:34.200 --> 14:39.480
At least sometimes 2,000 lines for a description.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.000
Somewhat difficult.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.400
But if you translate some more typical packages,

14:45.400 --> 14:46.440
it may be very short.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.000
And you can do one package a day, for example.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.240
So you can do really a true rhythm,

14:51.240 --> 14:54.800
to learn a true rhythm, and not, well,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.400
with a minimum follow up also.

14:57.400 --> 15:02.040
So I think it's a first step, which is very interesting.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.040
The next step could be the depth call screens

15:05.040 --> 15:07.720
on your way, or the newcomer.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.800
So depth call screens is other thing,

15:09.800 --> 15:13.720
because now you'll have to pass your translations, proposals

15:13.720 --> 15:16.960
on the mailing list, and to go in the process.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.320
So to understand the virtual address

15:19.320 --> 15:22.160
that we made in the topic, on the subject of the message,

15:22.160 --> 15:25.120
to be sure that the robot is able to understand

15:25.120 --> 15:27.280
what you're doing, and to report that

15:27.280 --> 15:31.120
in the tracking stats, in the tracking tables.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.760
So it's a bit more difficult. But well, you

15:33.760 --> 15:36.160
start having an experience of the Debian ecosystem.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.360
So we can consider that maybe you're

15:38.360 --> 15:40.360
ready to understand that.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.920
Maybe you will meet someone physically.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.720
We will explain to you how things work.

15:45.720 --> 15:50.320
And well, depth call, OK, you are going to now,

15:50.320 --> 15:53.360
intend to translate, request for review,

15:53.360 --> 15:56.760
last chance for a contributor for review.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.120
So you are going to really come in the process,

16:00.120 --> 16:04.440
to come in the Debian process, and to start contributing

16:04.440 --> 16:07.760
to really important things also.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.240
And it's the first responsibility

16:10.240 --> 16:13.480
in the process of Debian with the main working, et cetera,

16:13.480 --> 16:16.120
et cetera.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.960
And once you are completely comfortable with that,

16:18.960 --> 16:23.920
so the process is also here with coordination of the packages,

16:23.920 --> 16:27.840
with the messages which mentioned their status.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.000
And once the mail is received, of course,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.080
you can translate your things.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.720
You translate your profiles with your own editor.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.880
Why not on WebLates?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.320
Because I saw that WebLates can become

16:39.320 --> 16:43.800
a dictionary of translations while using its own editor.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.880
You test the results.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.400
You also can do that.

16:46.400 --> 16:50.520
You report when you finished and when the team is

16:50.520 --> 16:52.120
OK with your translation.

16:52.120 --> 16:57.080
You report a bug to upstream, to the package maintainer,

16:57.080 --> 17:02.520
and it puts the profile in the package.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.800
And the benefits of that is your user

17:04.800 --> 17:09.360
preferred text editor, as I said, or also your PO editor.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.160
PO editor localized are some editors, some KDE,

17:12.160 --> 17:15.520
which work very much for that, to identify, in particular,

17:15.520 --> 17:21.320
the fuzzy strings or the untranslated strings.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.960
Because I forgot to precise some important things also,

17:23.960 --> 17:28.120
is that if we should use some WebLates interface,

17:28.120 --> 17:30.040
some things like that, there is another problem

17:30.040 --> 17:34.080
for some contributors like me is the accessibility problems.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.960
So it would prevent persons to contribute

17:37.960 --> 17:40.120
due to accessibility problems.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.280
With this method, unlike you can use some users.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.600
Personally, I use Emacs.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.360
We get texts.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.160
It's easy because it's in text, and there are not

17:49.160 --> 17:50.760
problems related to accessibility.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.280
Well, once you are comfortable with that,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.080
maybe you want to contribute to the effort of the Debian

18:00.080 --> 18:02.880
community to contribute to main pages.

18:02.880 --> 18:07.360
My pages is a big project, 2,000 pages, about,

18:07.360 --> 18:10.280
and a lot of updates.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.840
So it's a big project.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.600
But the good thing is the method is the same.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.760
So you close the gates, you translate the profiles,

18:17.760 --> 18:20.520
you are on the mailing list with the topics,

18:20.520 --> 18:24.480
the virtual topics to follow the process.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.960
And when it's finished, you commit,

18:26.960 --> 18:30.960
or you make someone in the team to commit.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.160
So you know the process.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.240
You know how it works.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.160
You know the conventions in Debian.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.880
So now you are able to contribute

18:36.880 --> 18:40.720
to any project based on PO files,

18:40.720 --> 18:44.760
even if it's not some packages themselves,

18:44.760 --> 18:47.880
but you can do main pages, you can do package description,

18:47.880 --> 18:50.320
you can do Debian packages themselves.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.440
So it becomes for you easy to contribute

18:52.440 --> 18:54.200
because you understand the process,

18:54.200 --> 18:59.400
and also the human beings in the community.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.160
Well, the benefits of the main pages

19:03.160 --> 19:08.880
is that that, well, just translate and discuss.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.560
You don't have any maintenance to do because German team does

19:11.560 --> 19:14.680
that and does that very good.

19:14.680 --> 19:19.480
So it's a very new area which is accessible for everybody

19:19.480 --> 19:23.760
and which is very cool to use.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.000
The next step is to keep recognizing.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.800
And it's useful for the community, of course,

19:27.800 --> 19:32.000
because as you know, main pages, Debian translates that,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.600
but we don't translate only for Debian.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.240
We translate for all the communities

19:36.240 --> 19:39.920
because main pages are used in all the distributions.

19:39.920 --> 19:44.320
So also, this translation is a way for you

19:44.320 --> 19:48.560
to contribute for all the community.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.680
Then you have documentation, the Debian specific documentation.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.680
So related to the Debian software,

19:55.680 --> 19:57.360
we have the release notes, of course.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.240
We have the Debian developers reference, et cetera,

20:00.240 --> 20:00.960
et cetera.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.480
But also, now it's only profiles.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.800
So it's not so difficult to understand

20:05.800 --> 20:08.760
how it works and the process to have a review

20:08.760 --> 20:11.720
and to have a quality assurance by the community

20:11.720 --> 20:14.200
of the translators.

20:14.200 --> 20:19.080
And packages, same thing in interaction with the community.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.760
We can also now translate all the things.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.320
According to your time, you will choose one of these projects

20:25.320 --> 20:30.160
or just translate for one, two, three, or all those projects

20:30.160 --> 20:33.560
according to the time and the energy you have.

20:33.560 --> 20:41.560
The analysis also, of course, it starts being a bit different,

20:41.560 --> 20:46.480
just like the website, because you will start to play with HTML.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.200
So it starts to being different.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.960
It's a new area.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.760
And I think starting with package descriptions

20:52.760 --> 20:57.240
avoids any difficulty from a technical point of view.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.240
Then, PO-FISE, it starts making you

21:00.240 --> 21:02.800
in front of the difficulty of the process.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.080
But, well, OK, the process is done.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.680
And to finish, you come to HTML pages,

21:08.680 --> 21:13.920
where it may seem, for some people, somewhat difficult.

21:13.920 --> 21:18.480
Because, well, you have to address tags and many things

21:18.480 --> 21:20.560
that you have on the HTML page.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.160
So it may be somewhat difficult.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.440
And however, it's important, because on the website,

21:25.440 --> 21:28.680
we have the security analysis, we have the publicity,

21:28.680 --> 21:32.560
we have all the platform for the Debian project leader.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.760
So it may become important.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.800
And for any of these steps, you can, of course, take the time.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.680
For example, it would take three years to package descriptions

21:42.680 --> 21:46.720
and then wait still three years for main pages, et cetera,

21:46.720 --> 21:49.360
according to your rhythm and your energy.

21:49.360 --> 21:56.120
And especially, you can do what you want, review or translating.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.280
Generally, when arriving, we suggest

21:58.280 --> 22:01.000
to review, to understand the conventions,

22:01.000 --> 22:05.240
to understand the things, and to not take some time in your life.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.560
Then if you want to contribute to translating directly,

22:07.560 --> 22:09.040
it's a good idea.

22:09.040 --> 22:15.720
What I mean here is that we can do really at the, well,

22:15.720 --> 22:18.920
with the ways, with minimum ways and minimum installations,

22:18.920 --> 22:20.920
and the minimum understanding things,

22:20.920 --> 22:24.880
and especially on the progressive ways.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.000
Also, you can track in translations.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.880
So you subscribe to the mailing list,

22:29.880 --> 22:31.360
and you have a look at translations,

22:31.360 --> 22:34.640
and you follow what happens in matter of review,

22:34.640 --> 22:36.360
and in matter of translating new,

22:36.360 --> 22:40.280
if you consider that it's simple or short enough

22:40.280 --> 22:43.520
to make you spend the time to do it.

22:43.520 --> 22:46.160
So review and translating are the two steps

22:46.160 --> 22:50.600
you can do at any time in the process,

22:50.600 --> 22:53.040
and in your way on Debian.

22:53.040 --> 22:58.560
So to conclude, I would say that it's not an automated process,

22:58.560 --> 23:00.680
because we don't have the capability to do that.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.600
And I think the project is too complex today

23:02.600 --> 23:07.160
to do that efficiently, and it would imply some engineering

23:07.160 --> 23:09.360
to do things properly.

23:09.360 --> 23:15.080
But we have today some way, I think.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.960
And it's what I tried to suggest on the Wiki pages

23:17.960 --> 23:20.240
about translation and how to contribute

23:20.240 --> 23:24.120
and to start contributing and not being discouraged.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.720
I could have been during some years.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.880
There is a way from the most obvious, technically speaking,

23:32.880 --> 23:37.440
to less obvious with a contact with the community, which

23:37.440 --> 23:38.880
is progressive.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.160
And you discover how things work, the conventions,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.600
of course.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.800
The team discovers also if you are ready to respect

23:47.800 --> 23:51.560
how the team works, because we had some contributors where

23:51.560 --> 23:53.880
we've used it was complicated because he decided

23:53.880 --> 23:55.240
to do things like he wanted.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.640
Yes, but there is a team history.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.960
So you can do things like you want, as you want.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.200
Even if you're right, take the time and respect

24:04.200 --> 24:06.480
what other people do.

24:06.480 --> 24:12.040
And also, it's important to say that on the mailing list,

24:12.040 --> 24:16.120
also, if you start contributing via the mailing list,

24:16.120 --> 24:19.240
you have the chance to get your native language.

24:19.240 --> 24:23.160
Because in the French mailing list, but also in Italian,

24:23.160 --> 24:25.720
in Spanish, or any language, you have,

24:25.720 --> 24:27.360
for the translation teams, of course,

24:27.360 --> 24:29.880
people speaking your native language.

24:29.880 --> 24:33.800
So for example, now how to translate this English term

24:33.800 --> 24:37.440
in the language, it may be useful.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.920
And for example, in the package description,

24:39.920 --> 24:43.240
we also have a glossary to help people to know,

24:43.240 --> 24:46.600
OK, this English word which has a strange translation,

24:46.600 --> 24:47.760
should I translate?

24:47.760 --> 24:51.040
Or if I shouldn't translate, what should I do with that?

24:51.040 --> 24:54.760
And if I should translate, what kind of words is used usually?

24:54.760 --> 24:57.280
And once you do that, you can learn.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.320
And also, without any complicated tools

25:00.320 --> 25:04.520
or with no difficulties, you can start translating.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.280
And so you can become a Debian translator.

25:07.280 --> 25:12.280
Thanks.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.280
Oops.

25:14.280 --> 25:20.920
You've seen some feedback on some questions?

25:24.680 --> 25:28.400
For me, I can have feedback and global feedback

25:28.400 --> 25:30.760
on kind of all the things feedback.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.800
Because I have seen that maybe there

25:33.800 --> 25:36.880
is a fragmentation in different distribution.

25:36.880 --> 25:40.400
In Linux, and some have advantage,

25:40.400 --> 25:44.200
and the other not of this website.

25:44.200 --> 25:50.360
And so because I have never found a distribution that

25:50.360 --> 25:53.200
convinced me perfectly.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.040
For instance, for me, you have problem with vision.

25:57.040 --> 26:01.200
But for me, I have little problem with vision and granary.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.680
And so I should appreciate scrolling

26:03.680 --> 26:09.200
bar with a great and large line, a bit

26:09.200 --> 26:13.560
to go to adjust some problems.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.480
I doubt it's my MX Linux.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.760
They have a good scrolling bar, but also problems.

26:18.760 --> 26:26.480
So it's a kind I'd like to wish more cooperation

26:26.480 --> 26:29.840
with Linux as a problem of system day also,

26:29.840 --> 26:33.160
about something that I think is important

26:33.160 --> 26:42.600
for Linux community in general to have a better cooperation

26:42.600 --> 26:46.440
with different projects of distribution.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.120
I think that the importance is free software,

26:49.120 --> 26:51.160
even if what you say is right.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.600
I'm OK with that.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.760
According to my understanding of things and about translation,

26:56.760 --> 26:58.400
it's right also.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.480
Is that the user find a way for himself?

27:02.480 --> 27:05.440
I mean, that's OK.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.800
Debian has his way of work.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.280
Ubuntu has his way of work.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.400
And any project has his way of work according to the history,

27:12.400 --> 27:15.160
according to what it needs to be doing, et cetera.

27:15.160 --> 27:19.240
Well, the thing is how to enable a user

27:19.240 --> 27:23.440
to find among all the existing ways a way for him.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.240
And I think it's right for any new users,

27:26.240 --> 27:27.800
that's exactly what you're saying,

27:27.800 --> 27:30.720
but also it's right for new contributors.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.440
Because contributing may work according to some rules,

27:34.440 --> 27:38.360
some community interaction, some tools, of course.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.280
So it's not a kind of what is better, what is not better.

27:41.280 --> 27:45.400
It's only a kind of is it sweet for you, actually.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.480
And in the community, the benefit

27:47.480 --> 27:50.160
is that you have this diversity which

27:50.160 --> 27:52.520
enables you to decide what is good for you

27:52.520 --> 27:55.840
and what is good for your way of doing things.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.880
So it's a good thing.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.320
But yes, there are a lot of ways.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.240
And to find the way it's good for you is not easy.

28:06.840 --> 28:11.840
I think the De Leung community has something very good

28:11.840 --> 28:14.840
on which we should all learn to do

28:14.840 --> 28:18.320
is you have a very good translation workflow.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.800
And I think this is something valuable.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.800
And this is the reason why you are able to continue

28:24.800 --> 28:28.800
doing some email translation.

28:28.800 --> 28:35.800
Still, even if the world is using much different workflow,

28:35.800 --> 28:40.280
I think that's your bigger value in this.

28:40.280 --> 28:44.480
And my question would be, what are the limitations

28:44.480 --> 28:49.280
that you see in the existing translation platform

28:49.280 --> 28:53.800
in terms of accessibility for you who are blind,

28:53.800 --> 28:58.440
but also in terms of way to collaborate as a team?

28:58.440 --> 29:03.640
Because I did push forward late in many places.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.800
It helps a lot.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.560
But it doesn't create any miracle.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.960
The community needs to find a way

29:10.960 --> 29:14.040
to define the workflow, the way to collaborate together.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.920
And this is something that the rest of the resource community

29:16.920 --> 29:19.240
can learn from the De Leung community.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.400
Your tools are a little bit prehistoric.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.920
But your own way of working are very clear and easy

29:24.920 --> 29:26.400
to understand.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.840
And I would be interesting to have your feedback

29:28.840 --> 29:31.800
on translation platform in terms of accessibility.

29:31.800 --> 29:36.800
And what are lucky to have a proper collaboration

29:36.800 --> 29:40.400
as a team in what we have today?

29:40.400 --> 29:41.120
Thanks.

29:41.120 --> 29:45.040
Because you sum up what I want to show here.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.400
What you say is exactly what I think and I want to show.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.920
But I know, and I'm aware from some feedbacks I can have.

29:51.920 --> 29:56.680
And because I know there is a low stream of new,

29:56.680 --> 30:00.040
a low flow of new contributors, maybe,

30:00.040 --> 30:02.600
and I say maybe because I'm not sure myself about that.

30:02.600 --> 30:07.040
Because for me, indeed, what the tools we are using now

30:07.040 --> 30:10.000
are perfect because they are accessible, because they work,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.160
and because they are able to have a record

30:12.160 --> 30:14.160
and to have a team collaboration.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.560
So for me, these tools are really perfect.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.760
But in the new generation of new contributors,

30:20.760 --> 30:25.840
I know that indeed there are some more friendly interfaces,

30:25.840 --> 30:32.440
some more design, some ways to do a UI and UX, which

30:32.440 --> 30:35.880
is more beautiful and more friendly, more attractive,

30:35.880 --> 30:39.080
also, or you have less learning curve.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.880
So you can come in the project, do something,

30:41.880 --> 30:43.160
opt to leave, no problem.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.560
You don't have to learn during some months, something,

30:45.560 --> 30:46.400
et cetera, et cetera.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.200
So also, the problem today, the new contributors

30:50.200 --> 30:54.680
in our society is that people don't want less,

30:54.680 --> 30:56.840
want to get involved in the long term.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.040
They want to come, to try something, give it a try,

30:59.040 --> 31:01.400
opt and to leave, because, well, we have our lives,

31:01.400 --> 31:03.160
we have our obligations, et cetera.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.240
And that's right in Debian.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.520
It's something more difficult. Because in libraries,

31:06.520 --> 31:08.880
for example, you can go, OK, you have an error,

31:08.880 --> 31:11.680
or a mistake on the string, you open the relates, opt,

31:11.680 --> 31:13.960
you fix the string, opt and you leave away.

31:13.960 --> 31:14.840
And perfect.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.880
Well, in Debian, it's not possible.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.120
Well, it's possible for the package description,

31:19.120 --> 31:20.320
because it's a web interface.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.560
There is not a learning curve.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.600
It's very simple.

31:22.600 --> 31:26.160
But for people who don't want to do the effort to learn,

31:26.160 --> 31:30.120
we don't want to do the efforts of understanding deeply things,

31:30.120 --> 31:32.120
well, it may be destructive.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.560
Is it bad news?

31:33.560 --> 31:34.160
I don't know.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.120
I'm not sure.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.040
But the fact is that the team is small.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.240
And the fact is that we have no few contributors.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.680
So I wonder if it's a limitation.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.200
But for contributors who try to be forced to do that,

31:45.200 --> 31:48.760
I think these truths are indeed really perfect.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.120
Yeah, just one more question for the mute finish.

31:56.120 --> 32:00.160
So you've started a process to create new translations.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.200
Can you give some examples how you

32:03.200 --> 32:06.000
want to try in recipes to update existing translations,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.960
like the original text changes, the English text changes?

32:08.960 --> 32:10.400
How do you know about this?

32:10.400 --> 32:13.880
Do you notify the same translator as before?

32:13.880 --> 32:15.840
Can everybody jump in and think that?

32:18.440 --> 32:22.000
Do you think that the product will

32:22.000 --> 32:22.300
be possible in the

32:22.300 --> 32:26.280
process of not watching the web?

32:26.280 --> 32:29.560
Actually, for example, to take the depth

32:29.560 --> 32:31.840
core for the main pages, for example,

32:31.840 --> 32:35.880
when there is an update, the translator has a warning.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.120
He knows that he has something, which

32:38.120 --> 32:41.240
is because the translator is considered as the last one who

32:41.240 --> 32:45.160
can do the changes or should do the changes.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.720
Once he has this warning, either via mail

32:48.720 --> 32:52.560
or because he has a look on the statistics page,

32:52.560 --> 32:55.320
he says, OK, so I will do that.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.760
So he sends a mail with an address saying that, OK,

32:58.760 --> 33:03.840
this page, this description, this profile, I will translate it.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.120
So there is a mail.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.160
And the community has the information,

33:07.160 --> 33:10.680
is notified that the person is going to translate.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.080
After it, it will translate the profile,

33:13.080 --> 33:15.440
or the file in it.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.600
And then, OK, now I finished.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.760
Thanks to review the translation.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.480
So there are some review.

33:22.480 --> 33:26.080
It's a process which can be five days or 10 days

33:26.080 --> 33:28.440
according to the number of mistakes

33:28.440 --> 33:31.080
which needs to be fixed, et cetera.

33:31.080 --> 33:35.360
And at the end, he says, OK, last chance for change.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.560
So OK, it's the last chance for you to review and to tell me

33:38.560 --> 33:40.120
if there is a problem.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.280
And once that's done, when the mail arrives on the community

33:43.280 --> 33:47.480
team, if there is not any reply, well, OK,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.360
the translator can either report a bug

33:50.360 --> 33:52.560
to say to the maintainer of the package, OK,

33:52.560 --> 33:53.760
there is a new translation.

33:53.760 --> 33:54.840
It's updates.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.040
Please put it in your package.

33:57.040 --> 34:01.280
Or he can do it himself or herself

34:01.280 --> 34:05.360
if the person has the permission to access to the git

34:05.360 --> 34:08.200
and the repository and to do the translation.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.760
So it's manual.

34:09.760 --> 34:12.160
But of course, there are some scripts to do that.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.200
You don't have to do that manually.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.560
It's not mandatory.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.880
But the process is really you have a follow up

34:17.880 --> 34:21.320
of the situation via mail.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.320
OK.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.000
Thank you, Jochen.

34:23.000 --> 34:23.520
Thanks.

34:23.520 --> 34:31.480
Thank you.
