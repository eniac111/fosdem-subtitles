1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.840
Today, I'm going to be talking about public money, public code in Europe and basically

2
0:00:10.840 --> 0:00:17.400
try to do a very brief overview of what has happened in terms of public money, public

3
0:00:17.400 --> 0:00:21.800
code in the EU institutions.

4
0:00:21.800 --> 0:00:27.800
Because of time and also because of the topic, I just want to focus on public money, public

5
0:00:27.800 --> 0:00:35.680
code because I know that at the moment there are a lot of legislation going on that is

6
0:00:35.680 --> 0:00:40.560
worrying a lot of the community but I'm just going to exclude those.

7
0:00:40.560 --> 0:00:45.720
If you want to talk about those later, we'll be mainly in the booth or you can just shoot

8
0:00:45.720 --> 0:00:49.720
me an email and we can exchange some ideas.

9
0:00:49.720 --> 0:00:57.640
So I always like to start with the basics and always to put everybody on the same page,

10
0:00:57.640 --> 0:01:04.480
maybe this is very familiar for you but I think it is super important now more than

11
0:01:04.480 --> 0:01:12.720
ever to always remember that free software guarantees the four freedoms to use, start

12
0:01:12.720 --> 0:01:17.520
each year and improve the software and whenever one of those freedoms is excluded then we're

13
0:01:17.520 --> 0:01:23.760
talking about a non-free software project.

14
0:01:23.760 --> 0:01:27.240
How are you going to name it?

15
0:01:27.240 --> 0:01:31.480
We are the free software foundation in Europe so we empower users to control technology

16
0:01:31.480 --> 0:01:36.200
and we do this with free software and among different activities that we have, we have

17
0:01:36.200 --> 0:01:38.680
the public money, public code campaign.

18
0:01:38.680 --> 0:01:45.160
Maybe this is also very familiar for you and also mainly in this deaf room but also briefly

19
0:01:45.160 --> 0:01:46.920
overview of our campaign.

20
0:01:46.920 --> 0:01:55.880
We started this four, five years ago, 2017 and we are basically requiring legislation

21
0:01:55.880 --> 0:02:03.760
that demands that public procurement or public software that is procured for the public sector

22
0:02:03.760 --> 0:02:06.640
should be public code.

23
0:02:06.640 --> 0:02:11.480
And for this then we have different reasons, we use different arguments whenever we are

24
0:02:11.480 --> 0:02:15.760
talking with public administrations, with decision makers.

25
0:02:15.760 --> 0:02:21.720
So one of those is definitely tax saving because then the public money should be spent in the

26
0:02:21.720 --> 0:02:23.740
most efficient way.

27
0:02:23.740 --> 0:02:33.260
So there is no point to spend public money on proprietary licenses if you can reuse software.

28
0:02:33.260 --> 0:02:38.240
Then the collaboration part is also super important because we all know free software

29
0:02:38.240 --> 0:02:43.680
enhances interoperability and collaboration so administrations can collaborate with each

30
0:02:43.680 --> 0:02:48.080
other because it's open, because it's there and there is no need to reinvent the wheel

31
0:02:48.080 --> 0:02:50.280
again.

32
0:02:50.280 --> 0:02:55.240
And then it's also serving the public because then the public money given by the public,

33
0:02:55.240 --> 0:02:59.880
the people will know what the money is being spent and then I think we all agree if the

34
0:02:59.880 --> 0:03:03.400
money is spending a good way, we like that.

35
0:03:03.400 --> 0:03:09.080
And of course to foster innovation because then we have to start from scratch again but

36
0:03:09.080 --> 0:03:16.520
we can just reuse the solutions that already exist.

37
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:22.120
So we have in our open letter, we have an open letter that you can sign as individual

38
0:03:22.120 --> 0:03:25.160
organizations, but also public administrations.

39
0:03:25.160 --> 0:03:30.800
We have more than 10,000 signatures and now at the moment we have seven public administrations.

40
0:03:30.800 --> 0:03:37.160
There are some from Germany, from Sweden, from Spain, I think three of them.

41
0:03:37.160 --> 0:03:42.400
And then recently one from Luxembourg has also signed our open letter.

42
0:03:42.400 --> 0:03:52.520
So it is not so many but it is nice to see some administrations supporting our campaign.

43
0:03:52.520 --> 0:03:58.880
But yeah, so now that was a very brief overview of the public money public code campaign and

44
0:03:58.880 --> 0:04:06.520
within this we have different activities and we also actively try to advocate in the EU

45
0:04:06.520 --> 0:04:08.680
level in this regard.

46
0:04:08.680 --> 0:04:12.520
So today I want to talk about two EU institutions.

47
0:04:12.520 --> 0:04:16.680
I'm going to first start with the European Commission, what has happened in there over

48
0:04:16.680 --> 0:04:21.760
the last three, four years and also I will talk a little bit about the European Parliament,

49
0:04:21.760 --> 0:04:29.520
more specifically about the AI resolution, a little bit of the AI, ongoing AI act and

50
0:04:29.520 --> 0:04:34.920
then I will also talk very briefly about the declaration of digital rights because these

51
0:04:34.920 --> 0:04:39.560
are some of the files or legal documents where we have been active.

52
0:04:39.560 --> 0:04:44.960
And yeah, so let's start with the Commission.

53
0:04:44.960 --> 0:04:52.760
I think in order to talk about the Commission we have to talk about these two pilot projects,

54
0:04:52.760 --> 0:04:55.160
the EU FOSA and the EU FOSA2.

55
0:04:55.160 --> 0:04:59.680
So basically these were projects that were given to the European Commission by the European

56
0:04:59.680 --> 0:05:00.680
Parliament.

57
0:05:00.680 --> 0:05:06.720
So basically the European Parliament or the Commission get those pilot projects ready

58
0:05:06.720 --> 0:05:14.440
because we need to improve the security of the free software tools that have been or

59
0:05:14.440 --> 0:05:18.200
are used on the European institutions.

60
0:05:18.200 --> 0:05:22.880
So they did that, they did their best.

61
0:05:22.880 --> 0:05:30.600
Within those two pilot projects they did 15 Bantys, three Hackathons to actually audit

62
0:05:30.600 --> 0:05:37.520
the code of these free software tools within the institutions.

63
0:05:37.520 --> 0:05:44.160
However there was not budget allocated to these projects and therefore they could not

64
0:05:44.160 --> 0:05:46.880
run any longer.

65
0:05:46.880 --> 0:05:54.720
So this was basically like the European Parliament told them how to do it and what to do it but

66
0:05:54.720 --> 0:05:56.400
there was not budget allocated.

67
0:05:56.400 --> 0:06:02.000
And I think through my talk you will see that this is a, unfortunately this is a pattern,

68
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:07.400
there is a lot of nice warnings and a lot of nice initiatives but fortunately there

69
0:06:07.400 --> 0:06:10.480
is not budget.

70
0:06:10.480 --> 0:06:18.960
So they stopped doing these projects and in 2020 the European Commission released the

71
0:06:18.960 --> 0:06:22.800
open source strategy.

72
0:06:22.800 --> 0:06:29.400
And this strategy is super interesting because this is as you can read there it's a communication

73
0:06:29.400 --> 0:06:32.360
from the Commission to the Commission.

74
0:06:32.360 --> 0:06:38.040
So basically this is, I mean this is not a legal binding document so it's basically the

75
0:06:38.040 --> 0:06:48.240
Commission telling themselves how they should work with open source, what they should do.

76
0:06:48.240 --> 0:06:53.120
It's like a plan, it's not legal binding.

77
0:06:53.120 --> 0:06:58.960
So in this regard, I mean we still have to say that we acknowledge that the Commission

78
0:06:58.960 --> 0:07:03.960
has the will, has the initiative to set up these kind of things and then they are already

79
0:07:03.960 --> 0:07:08.960
realizing that open source has been used in the EU institutions and they need to do something

80
0:07:08.960 --> 0:07:10.600
about this.

81
0:07:10.600 --> 0:07:18.120
However as a strategy by itself it's rather weak because it doesn't have any real indicator

82
0:07:18.120 --> 0:07:23.800
or anything that we can, you know you can actually follow up what's happening and see

83
0:07:23.800 --> 0:07:28.000
the progress of such plans so far.

84
0:07:28.000 --> 0:07:33.320
So if you go to the text then you can see word in search of like whatever it makes sense

85
0:07:33.320 --> 0:07:39.800
to do so, the Commission will share the source code and again here is like when whatever

86
0:07:39.800 --> 0:07:43.640
makes sense or whenever it makes sense what does that even mean?

87
0:07:43.640 --> 0:07:52.280
Like it is not clear when the Commission should share the source code and then also in some

88
0:07:52.280 --> 0:08:00.440
apart there is a section that talks about that the Commission has the freedom to choose

89
0:08:00.440 --> 0:08:08.080
a non-open source tool if there are good reasons to do so and again like what is a good reason,

90
0:08:08.080 --> 0:08:09.200
what is not.

91
0:08:09.200 --> 0:08:16.960
So all this wording it's a little bit biased and not biased like ambiguous so to say so

92
0:08:16.960 --> 0:08:23.520
it is very unclear and therefore our analysis of this strategy is like okay nice you want

93
0:08:23.520 --> 0:08:29.200
to do something but there is still some, I don't know, we're not quite happy with the

94
0:08:29.200 --> 0:08:33.080
wording and the way it was done.

95
0:08:33.080 --> 0:08:39.440
However in 2021 then the European Commission also realized about this and then they had

96
0:08:39.440 --> 0:08:40.440
a decision.

97
0:08:40.440 --> 0:08:47.160
So this is a decision then we saw this transition between a project, a strategy, a communication

98
0:08:47.160 --> 0:08:50.440
to more like a legally binding paper.

99
0:08:50.440 --> 0:09:00.280
So in this paper they want to define the conditions under what the European Commission is going

100
0:09:00.280 --> 0:09:02.960
to share open source.

101
0:09:02.960 --> 0:09:12.360
And within this decision then we can see that they are trying now to implement, all that

102
0:09:12.360 --> 0:09:17.680
is already happening, the European Commission open source program office.

103
0:09:17.680 --> 0:09:23.440
So basically this is kind of like the office that will be in charge of taking care of all

104
0:09:23.440 --> 0:09:30.000
these plans or all these decisions from the past documents I already talked about.

105
0:09:30.000 --> 0:09:36.320
So this is a step, I mean now there is an open source program office that is actually

106
0:09:36.320 --> 0:09:46.200
trying to act as a facilitator so they also do some backbond days, they also do hackathons

107
0:09:46.200 --> 0:09:52.360
and I have to say that they're really trying to do something about this, they're trying

108
0:09:52.360 --> 0:09:58.840
to implement all these projects and all these plans and all these strategies but again there

109
0:09:58.840 --> 0:10:03.840
is not budget allocated to this ESIP OSBO.

110
0:10:03.840 --> 0:10:10.640
So for them it's really hard to do what they have to do because there is not human capacity

111
0:10:10.640 --> 0:10:14.200
because basically there is no budget so it's really difficult.

112
0:10:14.200 --> 0:10:24.080
So here we find ourselves again with a very nice wording, there is like the will and the

113
0:10:24.080 --> 0:10:34.360
initiative to do something about this but there is no budget allocated to these initiatives.

114
0:10:34.360 --> 0:10:39.480
Within this decision then in the Article 6 a public repository is also included and this

115
0:10:39.480 --> 0:10:45.960
is definitely something good, I mean we have been advocating for public repository for

116
0:10:45.960 --> 0:10:56.760
all the open source tools that the European institutions used and this is publicly available.

117
0:10:56.760 --> 0:11:03.200
So this is again another step here, from here we can see not only the European institutions

118
0:11:03.200 --> 0:11:08.560
are sharing what they're using but this is also trying to include member states so they're

119
0:11:08.560 --> 0:11:17.240
also trying to see, you know, to build this interoperable network among member states.

120
0:11:17.240 --> 0:11:24.120
So in terms of public code this is again a step and I feel like this is going on the

121
0:11:24.120 --> 0:11:33.280
right path but I can really say enough that there are some things that need to be worked

122
0:11:33.280 --> 0:11:41.280
and work such as the wording has to be more clear and again there should be more budget

123
0:11:41.280 --> 0:11:46.560
allocated to free software in general and this is not happening at the moment.

124
0:11:46.560 --> 0:11:52.840
So this is basically what is happening in the European Commission, I know that at the

125
0:11:52.840 --> 0:11:58.000
moment the European Commission is proposing a lot of legislation and initiatives towards

126
0:11:58.000 --> 0:12:07.480
open source, they are realizing that open source free software it needs a special regulation,

127
0:12:07.480 --> 0:12:15.000
it is important, in my point of view they are noticing that but yeah within the European

128
0:12:15.000 --> 0:12:19.320
Commission this is what's happening, we can see there is will, there is something the

129
0:12:19.320 --> 0:12:27.660
OSBO is trying to do whatever they can but not budget at all allocated in this.

130
0:12:27.660 --> 0:12:30.620
So now let's talk a little bit about the European Parliament.

131
0:12:30.620 --> 0:12:41.760
So as I mentioned very briefly I want to talk about mainly the EU AI resolution, this was

132
0:12:41.760 --> 0:12:48.440
a resolution that was led by the special committee that was created in the European Parliament

133
0:12:48.440 --> 0:12:54.920
to take care of, to do this resolution and this resolution is again not legally binding

134
0:12:54.920 --> 0:13:02.000
it's just an opinion like a guideline for the ongoing AI act and the AI act is going

135
0:13:02.000 --> 0:13:07.800
to be a regulation so this is going to be legally binding but the European Parliament

136
0:13:07.800 --> 0:13:13.920
decide to create this committee to exchange views to talk with experts, to with stakeholders

137
0:13:13.920 --> 0:13:18.280
and yeah they come up with this resolution.

138
0:13:18.280 --> 0:13:24.680
So of course we also try to advocate there although we knew it was not legally binding

139
0:13:24.680 --> 0:13:32.040
but again these are guidelines and the decision makers really this is a good argument for

140
0:13:32.040 --> 0:13:37.200
us you know if there are guidelines we can always bring them to these guidelines because

141
0:13:37.200 --> 0:13:42.200
that's why they are using them for right because they need to be used, you always need to go

142
0:13:42.200 --> 0:13:45.160
and look back to these guidelines.

143
0:13:45.160 --> 0:13:52.240
So in this regard it's hard to say if it was completely successful or not but there was

144
0:13:52.240 --> 0:14:00.960
a huge step, there is a recital that talks about public procurement on AI, again we see

145
0:14:00.960 --> 0:14:07.760
this pattern from the EU institutions to have this very ambiguous wording of whatever it's

146
0:14:07.760 --> 0:14:12.520
appropriate whenever it makes sense, whatever there are good reasons and in this recital

147
0:14:12.520 --> 0:14:18.960
we see again as you can see I just caught this recital.

148
0:14:18.960 --> 0:14:27.400
So nice I mean this is step and I guess in this regard we can always use it to benefit

149
0:14:27.400 --> 0:14:32.960
the community but it's still super ambiguous.

150
0:14:32.960 --> 0:14:39.400
So this recital was voted especially like the specific recital and the good thing is

151
0:14:39.400 --> 0:14:45.160
that it found a huge majority within the European Parliament so that tells something as well

152
0:14:45.160 --> 0:14:50.240
that tells also the will that the European Parliament has but the downside as I already

153
0:14:50.240 --> 0:14:56.760
mentioned is it's not legally binding it's just a guideline but at least we have something

154
0:14:56.760 --> 0:15:05.880
right so in this regard then we would say that decision makers understood the importance

155
0:15:05.880 --> 0:15:09.800
of open source on AI.

156
0:15:09.800 --> 0:15:18.520
So to briefly talk a little bit about our FSP demands for the AI legislation we basically

157
0:15:18.520 --> 0:15:24.480
we are it's very straightforward we say like AI should be fair transparent accessible

158
0:15:24.480 --> 0:15:31.920
and this is only possible if it's open source and then of course we have an argument on

159
0:15:31.920 --> 0:15:37.320
public research and public AI so whenever there is public money invested on research

160
0:15:37.320 --> 0:15:43.200
on AI then it should be also public AI.

161
0:15:43.200 --> 0:15:49.960
At the moment the AI act has been still discussed at the European Parliament so nobody knows

162
0:15:49.960 --> 0:15:53.880
how the final text would look like we don't know if the European Parliament is going to

163
0:15:53.880 --> 0:16:03.760
go back and see these guidelines from the AI resolution it is not clear but I feel like

164
0:16:03.760 --> 0:16:08.520
we step in in the moment that we could we're still going to try to monitor what's happening

165
0:16:08.520 --> 0:16:15.440
there but so far it's really difficult to see how that's going to develop from now on

166
0:16:15.440 --> 0:16:19.600
until I don't know I think the last this is going to be vote by the end of the year and

167
0:16:19.600 --> 0:16:23.680
the last plenary I don't know.

168
0:16:23.680 --> 0:16:30.120
And finally I want to talk a little bit about the declaration of digital rights so this

169
0:16:30.120 --> 0:16:40.400
was also an initiative of course from the Commission they just want to have this guidelines

170
0:16:40.400 --> 0:16:46.480
I guess as well as a reference point for the digital transformation of Europe so we decide

171
0:16:46.480 --> 0:16:53.360
to also step in because as well as like with the Berlin Declaration and the Tallinn Declaration

172
0:16:53.360 --> 0:16:58.640
these are always guidelines that we use to talk to decision makers to public administrations

173
0:16:58.640 --> 0:17:04.720
because they are there and they talk about public procurement and free software so we

174
0:17:04.720 --> 0:17:11.320
said like let's try to also influence the way the wording is going to happen in this

175
0:17:11.320 --> 0:17:17.560
declaration again I mean this is just like you know it's a it's a guideline document

176
0:17:17.560 --> 0:17:24.360
for their ongoing legislation so a lot of people didn't really like see the point to

177
0:17:24.360 --> 0:17:31.680
work on this paper but I personally I saw that it was like the baseline to discuss further

178
0:17:31.680 --> 0:17:37.760
legislation so we went for it and this was super interesting because we also try to we

179
0:17:37.760 --> 0:17:43.720
approach decision makers on the European Parliament then they had an opinion as a European Parliament

180
0:17:43.720 --> 0:17:52.160
I win this opinion before going into the inter institutional negotiations the European position

181
0:17:52.160 --> 0:17:58.720
the European Parliament position was open source or free software was included on AI

182
0:17:58.720 --> 0:18:09.480
system so there was a nice a article there that was in which open source was included

183
0:18:09.480 --> 0:18:18.040
however once the three institutions sat down to discuss then this wording was completely

184
0:18:18.040 --> 0:18:25.080
gone and then at the moment like the final text that was signed by the three institutions

185
0:18:25.080 --> 0:18:31.480
remove completely the part on open source on AI and then we just have a reference to

186
0:18:31.480 --> 0:18:38.480
promoting interoperability open technologies and standards that's the final text it's super

187
0:18:38.480 --> 0:18:45.480
unclear I mean is it open standards is it on the standards it is for us it was like

188
0:18:45.480 --> 0:18:55.040
our it was not the ideal outcome because we were quite happy yeah quite happy with the

189
0:18:55.040 --> 0:18:59.680
with the opinion from the European Parliament but then this was completely changed and that's

190
0:18:59.680 --> 0:19:06.640
what usually most of the times happens whenever the three institutions sit down to to discuss

191
0:19:06.640 --> 0:19:11.400
however again I mean let's look at the bright side as well we saw that the European Parliament

192
0:19:11.400 --> 0:19:20.400
in its position a included open source free software so again this shows that there is

193
0:19:20.400 --> 0:19:27.240
a will or there is a there is an understanding from the European Parliament as well on this

194
0:19:27.240 --> 0:19:38.720
on the importance of open source free software on AI or on public procurement so yeah unfortunately

195
0:19:38.720 --> 0:19:48.720
this is how this end up not the best outcome but yeah I mean this is this is what you get

196
0:19:48.720 --> 0:19:57.560
when you try to advocate this European institution sometimes so just to maybe talk a little bit

197
0:19:57.560 --> 0:20:05.760
what's ahead of us we see and I think you already got it we have very ambiguous wording

198
0:20:05.760 --> 0:20:12.640
on the documents that we have so far so we just really trying to advocate for a clear

199
0:20:12.640 --> 0:20:20.560
and consistent wording about free software in ongoing legislation so we cannot change

200
0:20:20.560 --> 0:20:26.360
what's done already but we want to I mean now that this is being included we want to

201
0:20:26.360 --> 0:20:31.840
make sure that the wording is more clear and also consistent so again the European Commission

202
0:20:31.840 --> 0:20:35.640
doesn't have to come up with a new wording with a new inclusion with something different

203
0:20:35.640 --> 0:20:39.680
but they can just reuse what it's already there and we want to make sure that if we

204
0:20:39.680 --> 0:20:44.520
get to this point then this wording is clear and of course that it benefits the free software

205
0:20:44.520 --> 0:20:52.120
ecosystem in general and then of course there is a problem with implementation because not

206
0:20:52.120 --> 0:21:00.960
yeah we have nice wording documents but there to practice it's a it's a little bit different

207
0:21:00.960 --> 0:21:08.080
so we want to keep monitoring you know like how much of this a a legally binding documents

208
0:21:08.080 --> 0:21:12.520
have been properly implemented so we basically with this we just have to keep advocating

209
0:21:12.520 --> 0:21:17.160
for public money public code and then trying to make sure that there is a proper implementation

210
0:21:17.160 --> 0:21:23.240
implementation of such documents and last but not least I think that's one of the most

211
0:21:23.240 --> 0:21:29.320
important one is that we really want to keep demanding that is governmental budget allocated

212
0:21:29.320 --> 0:21:37.080
to free software because as we can see there is there is will there is some text but if

213
0:21:37.080 --> 0:21:43.720
there is not budget then that becomes very difficult so that's that's what we have ahead

214
0:21:43.720 --> 0:21:50.040
of us it's not quite easy but at least we have seen what's like the the transition and

215
0:21:50.040 --> 0:21:56.880
not the whole process we have already pinpoint what we need to focus on and yeah we're just

216
0:21:56.880 --> 0:22:04.240
going to try to do our best to to do so so and for this we also need our community we

217
0:22:04.240 --> 0:22:10.160
are I mean it is important to talk to decision makers but it's also important that the free

218
0:22:10.160 --> 0:22:18.760
software ecosystem the free software community also approaches administration's you know

219
0:22:18.760 --> 0:22:24.480
raise awareness of this matter as well so you can convince your local administration

220
0:22:24.480 --> 0:22:29.600
and for these if you might be interested I also invite you to see the talk from my one

221
0:22:29.600 --> 0:22:35.240
of my colleagues in the community that room he's going to explain more how you can actually

222
0:22:35.240 --> 0:22:40.800
get active on our the framework of our public money public code because there is this sometimes

223
0:22:40.800 --> 0:22:46.280
people don't really see the power that use that you guys have to reach out your local

224
0:22:46.280 --> 0:22:49.480
administrations and also you know like we're not talking about the European Parliament

225
0:22:49.480 --> 0:22:53.880
European Commission we're talking about the library of your town that's also a public

226
0:22:53.880 --> 0:23:01.360
administration so I invite you also if you are interested to check that talk you can

227
0:23:01.360 --> 0:23:06.400
sign or open letter of course as individuals organizations or if also you want to convince

228
0:23:06.400 --> 0:23:12.760
your local administration to sign the open letter well that's pretty nice and of course

229
0:23:12.760 --> 0:23:19.160
I mean donations are always working we're a charity and we are really trying to work

230
0:23:19.160 --> 0:23:26.600
as much as we can for to to come up with legislation that benefits the whole free software community

231
0:23:26.600 --> 0:23:30.400
and of course spreading the word I know that this public money public code campaign is

232
0:23:30.400 --> 0:23:35.680
quite well known but it's you know there is always people that don't know or people that

233
0:23:35.680 --> 0:23:41.600
don't really know what free software is so all these things are super important we also

234
0:23:41.600 --> 0:23:45.880
have a I mean we have a brochure on public money public code but then we also have a

235
0:23:45.880 --> 0:23:51.120
brochure that we have prepared for AI that we use also to reach out to decision makers

236
0:23:51.120 --> 0:23:56.880
it's also on our website so if you also want to take a look at this position paper and

237
0:23:56.880 --> 0:24:05.680
distribute it feel free to do so and yeah with this just to close up I don't want to

238
0:24:05.680 --> 0:24:09.800
I don't want you to leave this room feeling a little bit upset or like you know sad I

239
0:24:09.800 --> 0:24:14.640
feel like personally I feel quite positive for what's happening at the moment with other

240
0:24:14.640 --> 0:24:23.360
files as well it is just a matter to you know we that's why I really like these spaces and

241
0:24:23.360 --> 0:24:30.160
these events where we can talk to each other we can you know discuss and then we can actually

242
0:24:30.160 --> 0:24:35.800
bring all these positions and all these concerns to decision makers because there is a gap

243
0:24:35.800 --> 0:24:40.720
between the community and decision makers and we're trying to close that gap or build

244
0:24:40.720 --> 0:24:46.480
a bridge so the future legislation that is happening it's yeah it really benefits free

245
0:24:46.480 --> 0:24:59.120
software so yeah thank you very much and now very happy to take questions okay yeah yeah

246
0:24:59.120 --> 0:25:11.120
I wonder why I don't hear anything about the cases compared to five years ago open source

247
0:25:11.120 --> 0:25:18.120
did not exist in any enterprise at European Commission and any organization nowadays anyone

248
0:25:18.120 --> 0:25:26.560
can use mainly or 100% 90% open source software and I hear you only complain that it's not

249
0:25:26.560 --> 0:25:34.800
a free software the software that is graduated by CNCF it is vetted it is supported by many

250
0:25:34.800 --> 0:25:41.240
organizations there's a rigorous process to get it through and to get a new release and

251
0:25:41.240 --> 0:25:46.320
I I don't hear anything about what happened how much of a change we had the last five

252
0:25:46.320 --> 0:25:53.360
years and how much much much better the world is since five years ago then we had only Windows

253
0:25:53.360 --> 0:26:00.160
and VMware and IBM and now we have large large organization for the huge amount of

254
0:26:00.160 --> 0:26:09.360
code and I need to complain I would say it's a different whole topic yeah I mean can you

255
0:26:09.360 --> 0:26:16.440
please repeat the question for the livestream well okay why am I complaining that it's not

256
0:26:16.440 --> 0:26:22.720
like free software although we have seen some changes on inclusion of open source in the EU

257
0:26:22.720 --> 0:26:30.760
institutions over the last five years right that's basically well but I mean it was not available

258
0:26:30.760 --> 0:26:36.480
very like the open source solutions that have been using in the European Commission are not

259
0:26:36.480 --> 0:26:41.200
publicly available until they just released this public repository before they were not

260
0:26:41.200 --> 0:26:46.120
publicly available so they were using inner source they were using open source within the institutions

261
0:26:46.120 --> 0:26:56.680
but that was not open to the public and that's what we are demanding but is it available to

262
0:26:56.680 --> 0:27:11.080
the public yeah but it that was yeah exactly and that's not available to the public and that's our

263
0:27:11.080 --> 0:27:16.680
demand I mean nice they're using open source but is it available to us no until now and that's why

264
0:27:16.680 --> 0:27:22.520
I mean I I'm sorry but I was not really trying to complain at all I mean not only complaining I also

265
0:27:22.520 --> 0:27:27.480
was highlighting their will that this you institutions having because I can't see it as well I mean there

266
0:27:27.480 --> 0:27:32.840
has been a huge shift and a huge change and there is will now now we have a public repository of the

267
0:27:32.840 --> 0:27:40.880
free software using the public in the EU institutions that's something but I'm sorry this is not good

268
0:27:40.880 --> 0:28:10.760
enough yeah yeah yeah I mean we die it's a little bit tricky oh yeah yeah we

269
0:28:10.760 --> 0:28:17.680
know that what what do we mean with AI being accessible I mean I also have to say I'm not an

270
0:28:17.680 --> 0:28:25.120
AI expert here but I mean AI needs a lot of data to be trained and then if you're using open data

271
0:28:25.120 --> 0:28:33.840
then the results of research of AI to build something it should be at least available to

272
0:28:33.840 --> 0:28:40.000
people I'm not saying all the AI should be open I mean this is another discussion but if there is

273
0:28:40.000 --> 0:28:44.920
public money involved in the research then it should be open and people should be able to see

274
0:28:44.920 --> 0:28:51.320
how these AI systems are being trained are and what kind of data has been used and yeah what not

275
0:28:51.320 --> 0:29:09.880
yeah yeah I mean yeah yeah this is a question I regarding this year

276
0:29:09.880 --> 0:29:17.600
a and that maybe it's a huge threat for the free software community in the beginning of this talk

277
0:29:17.600 --> 0:29:22.680
I mentioned that I wanted to focus on the public money public code so basically public procurement

278
0:29:22.680 --> 0:29:30.560
on an open source I would be very happy to chat with you about this because we have also been

279
0:29:30.560 --> 0:29:36.160
meeting decision makers on this file as well and so far it is still a little bit unclear how we're

280
0:29:36.160 --> 0:29:41.040
gonna move forward from our side and also from their side this is just starting so I cannot

281
0:29:41.040 --> 0:29:47.080
really let me tell you more but if for this for this topic I would prefer to keep this out and

282
0:29:47.080 --> 0:29:51.200
then I will be very happy to stay with you after after this talk and then we can chat a little bit

283
0:29:51.200 --> 0:29:59.200
yeah I mean yesterday yesterday at 11 there you can see the recordings there was the European

284
0:29:59.200 --> 0:30:03.920
Commission was here was a with Red Hat they did a panel on this year a there was it was super

285
0:30:03.920 --> 0:30:10.680
interesting so I also invite you if you couldn't attend to see the recordings of this panel

286
0:30:10.680 --> 0:30:27.360
yeah this is my time's up yeah I'm gonna reply to this yeah so if this is in line with the

287
0:30:27.360 --> 0:30:33.400
research community as well and this is something we have noticed and we are really trying to focus

288
0:30:33.400 --> 0:30:38.240
more now on research because I feel like this is a community that we have left a little bit apart

289
0:30:38.240 --> 0:30:43.880
and behind and with AI we know we notice the importance of including all this research

290
0:30:43.880 --> 0:30:50.280
communities so this is definitely something we want to keep working on and keep I don't know try to

291
0:30:50.280 --> 0:30:55.560
do it better in a better way because it is definitely a community that can contribute a lot

292
0:30:55.560 --> 0:31:03.040
to us and I think they're quite open to this to to be open to be free software and so on so yeah

293
0:31:03.040 --> 0:31:26.120
this is on our agenda yeah thank you very much you you
