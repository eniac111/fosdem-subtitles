00:00.000 --> 00:15.780
After two years of... for them at home. This is our first in-persona for them, so welcome.

00:15.780 --> 00:25.080
So just to remember you... oh, where is the mouse? Okay. Just... oh, back. Okay, just

00:25.080 --> 00:33.660
a few rules. You're not in your room anymore, so please keep all the rubbish on the trash

00:33.660 --> 00:41.560
bin and just try to leave the room clean. There's rules about no food and no drinks,

00:41.560 --> 00:50.520
or just... it's fine if you drink, but try not to bring your food with you in the room.

00:50.520 --> 01:01.960
That's all. And so the post-COVID rule, so masks are not mandatory for the folks, but

01:01.960 --> 01:10.560
we don't correct the use. If you want to use one, just feel free. And we try to ventilate

01:10.560 --> 01:20.200
the room after each talk. So maybe if people in the back could help us, because we have

01:20.200 --> 01:28.040
five minutes to switch from one speaker to the other, so feel free to help us. So aside

01:28.040 --> 01:39.800
from that, this is the schedule for this morning. Yeah, we'll be the first speaker this morning

01:39.800 --> 01:53.600
about BSD drivers, and we'll finish with the Kimura Linux, the last I'll finish at 2pm.

01:53.600 --> 02:11.400
So that's mostly all. Thank you very much for being here, and enjoy your frozen.
