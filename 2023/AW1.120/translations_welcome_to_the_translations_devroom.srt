1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.000
So, let me put here some minutes.

2
0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:10.000
My name is Paul.

3
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:12.000
I'm from Brazil.

4
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:19.320
And in Brazil, I help the translation team for Debian, translation for Portuguese.

5
0:00:19.320 --> 0:00:21.440
I'm a Debian developer, too.

6
0:00:21.440 --> 0:00:29.080
So I work with packages in translation for Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese.

7
0:00:29.080 --> 0:00:34.640
And I'm coordinating the translation here this afternoon.

8
0:00:34.640 --> 0:00:40.360
We will have six talks today from different projects.

9
0:00:40.360 --> 0:00:43.360
And each of them, they have 30 minutes.

10
0:00:43.360 --> 0:00:48.360
So the speakers know they have 30 minutes to talk.

11
0:00:48.360 --> 0:00:49.360
I don't think so.

12
0:00:49.360 --> 0:00:50.360
I'll have to bring this here.

13
0:00:50.360 --> 0:00:51.360
Ah, okay.

14
0:00:51.360 --> 0:00:52.360
I live here.

15
0:00:52.360 --> 0:00:53.940
Thank you.

16
0:00:53.940 --> 0:01:01.640
So each speaker will have 30 minutes to talk, including the key part.

17
0:01:01.640 --> 0:01:10.600
I would like to say thank you very much for Fosden organizers and for speakers to be here.

18
0:01:10.600 --> 0:01:16.000
I'm sure that will be a great experience for everybody.

19
0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:22.120
I believe this is the first time we have a translation dev room at Fosden.

20
0:01:22.120 --> 0:01:27.160
So the first time we have a dedicated room for translation.

21
0:01:27.160 --> 0:01:28.160
So this is good.

22
0:01:28.160 --> 0:01:36.200
I hope this is the first of many dev rooms that will be on the future.

23
0:01:36.200 --> 0:01:38.560
And I hope everybody enjoy it.

24
0:01:38.560 --> 0:01:43.080
I will be sitting here if someone needs something with me, talk with me.

25
0:01:43.080 --> 0:01:44.080
I will be there.

26
0:01:44.080 --> 0:01:47.800
Yeah, I'm using this blue shirt.

27
0:01:47.800 --> 0:01:48.800
So that's it.

28
0:01:48.800 --> 0:01:49.800
Thank you very much.

29
0:01:49.800 --> 0:01:53.120
Thank you.
