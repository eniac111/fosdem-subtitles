00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
So, let me put here some minutes.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Paul.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm from Brazil.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.320
And in Brazil, I help the translation team for Debian, translation for Portuguese.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.440
I'm a Debian developer, too.

00:21.440 --> 00:29.080
So I work with packages in translation for Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.640
And I'm coordinating the translation here this afternoon.

00:34.640 --> 00:40.360
We will have six talks today from different projects.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.360
And each of them, they have 30 minutes.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.360
So the speakers know they have 30 minutes to talk.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
I don't think so.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
I'll have to bring this here.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
Ah, okay.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.360
I live here.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.940
Thank you.

00:53.940 --> 01:01.640
So each speaker will have 30 minutes to talk, including the key part.

01:01.640 --> 01:10.600
I would like to say thank you very much for Fosden organizers and for speakers to be here.

01:10.600 --> 01:16.000
I'm sure that will be a great experience for everybody.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.120
I believe this is the first time we have a translation dev room at Fosden.

01:22.120 --> 01:27.160
So the first time we have a dedicated room for translation.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
So this is good.

01:28.160 --> 01:36.200
I hope this is the first of many dev rooms that will be on the future.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.560
And I hope everybody enjoy it.

01:38.560 --> 01:43.080
I will be sitting here if someone needs something with me, talk with me.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.080
I will be there.

01:44.080 --> 01:47.800
Yeah, I'm using this blue shirt.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
So that's it.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Thank you very much.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.120
Thank you.
