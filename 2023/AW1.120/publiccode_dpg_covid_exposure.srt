1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:14.200
All right. Thanks everyone for coming so early. I admire your... I'm very impressed to tee

2
0:00:14.200 --> 0:00:22.280
up this early in the morning. I'm David Llewelyn-Jones. I work for a company called Yolo O in Finland.

3
0:00:22.280 --> 0:00:29.980
We make an operating system called Selfish OS for mobile phones like this one. And today

4
0:00:29.980 --> 0:00:36.000
I'm going to talk to you about COVID exposure notification. It's actually a project that

5
0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:40.800
was done... It was a personal project rather than something related to the company. But

6
0:00:40.800 --> 0:00:44.640
it was something that relates to Selfish OS. So hopefully it all kind of comes together

7
0:00:44.640 --> 0:00:54.880
in some kind of sensible way. Okay. So exposure notification. It's almost certainly something

8
0:00:54.880 --> 0:01:01.400
that you've all come across individually. Essentially it's the apps that people ran on their phones

9
0:01:01.400 --> 0:01:06.960
that did contact tracing. They would give you an alert if you had been in contact with

10
0:01:06.960 --> 0:01:14.000
someone who had a COVID diagnosis. And I guess they were a big deal during COVID. I guess

11
0:01:14.000 --> 0:01:21.360
probably they're less of a big deal now. Although I track the numbers on my phone while I'm

12
0:01:21.360 --> 0:01:27.920
at FOSDEM and there's still a lot of people at FOSDEM using them. I can tell that. And

13
0:01:27.920 --> 0:01:34.760
the idea about this talk is that I want to talk about a very particular implementation

14
0:01:34.760 --> 0:01:40.120
of it. And that's the Google Apple Exposure Notification Protocol, which was released

15
0:01:40.120 --> 0:01:49.920
I guess in April 2020. And it was an implementation that went out to Android devices and iPhones

16
0:01:49.920 --> 0:01:56.480
in order to basically provide the services needed in order to allow countries or medical

17
0:01:56.480 --> 0:02:02.440
organisations to build apps on top of it in order to perform this contact tracing process.

18
0:02:02.440 --> 0:02:06.440
And initially when it was released it was called, as you can see here, the contact tracing

19
0:02:06.440 --> 0:02:10.960
API. Later on I guess that name was a little bit ambiguous, a little bit confusing. They

20
0:02:10.960 --> 0:02:16.040
changed it to the Google and Apple Exposure Notification API. I guess when people think

21
0:02:16.040 --> 0:02:19.440
about contact tracing they think about maybe people phoning them up and asking them who

22
0:02:19.440 --> 0:02:27.280
they've been close to. But it is all the same thing. And this was the original specification.

23
0:02:27.280 --> 0:02:34.160
Like I say, the original one was released in April 2020. And it's made up of these three

24
0:02:34.160 --> 0:02:38.600
documents. It was initially, this was version 1.1. I think they're up to version 1.4 or

25
0:02:38.600 --> 0:02:42.840
later now. There's been several versions that have come out since. So they've refined the

26
0:02:42.840 --> 0:02:49.280
protocol. And I guess it's worth putting it in a little bit of context. Back then when

27
0:02:49.280 --> 0:02:56.400
this was released there was no vaccine. So at that point in time people thought that

28
0:02:56.400 --> 0:03:01.880
the World Health Organisation predicted that vaccine was about 16 months away but no one

29
0:03:01.880 --> 0:03:07.800
was entirely sure. In practice the first vaccine was actually approved about nine months after

30
0:03:07.800 --> 0:03:13.440
this. But you can imagine that at this point in time people were very worried about COVID.

31
0:03:13.440 --> 0:03:17.140
They were concerned about how it was going to be dealt with. And this was seen as kind

32
0:03:17.140 --> 0:03:24.480
of like a kind of one really quite exciting way to address the problem given that there

33
0:03:24.480 --> 0:03:30.400
were so few tools at that time to deal with things. So let me just talk about these three

34
0:03:30.400 --> 0:03:33.720
documents. The first one on the left here is the Bluetooth specification. So it's made

35
0:03:33.720 --> 0:03:38.920
up of three parts. The Bluetooth specification, I'll talk about how it works in practice in

36
0:03:38.920 --> 0:03:43.880
a second or two. But it's sending beacons using Bluetooth from your phone. So the Bluetooth

37
0:03:43.880 --> 0:03:52.440
specification tells you essentially how to pack the data into a Bluetooth beacon and

38
0:03:52.440 --> 0:03:57.840
also other details like for example for privacy reasons the information in the beacon changes

39
0:03:57.840 --> 0:04:02.920
periodically and you have to change the MAC address of your phone in sequence with that

40
0:04:02.920 --> 0:04:07.440
in order to avoid privacy problems coming up. So that's that part. There's a cryptography

41
0:04:07.440 --> 0:04:13.960
specification because the data that is sent in the beacons is cryptographically I guess

42
0:04:13.960 --> 0:04:19.720
hidden in order for privacy reasons. And then finally there's the framework documentation

43
0:04:19.720 --> 0:04:27.440
which is the API which is really describing how organizations can make use of these tools.

44
0:04:27.440 --> 0:04:32.680
And I guess another important point about it is that there are two parts to the process.

45
0:04:32.680 --> 0:04:38.120
So Google and Apple released this API for all phones but that's actually only half of

46
0:04:38.120 --> 0:04:42.640
it. That sends out the beacons. But as those beacons go around eventually you have to do

47
0:04:42.640 --> 0:04:47.280
something with that data that's being sent. And for that you needed an app that was going

48
0:04:47.280 --> 0:04:52.960
to be written by a government organization, a government level organization, like it could

49
0:04:52.960 --> 0:04:59.080
be a health organization. And Google and Apple had nothing to do with that. They said you

50
0:04:59.080 --> 0:05:04.920
know you've got to write that part. We'll just give you this piece here. And the project

51
0:05:04.920 --> 0:05:09.080
that I'm essentially talking about is about a reimplementation of this for Salesforce OS.

52
0:05:09.080 --> 0:05:12.640
And so of course we had to also deal with those two parts separately. So this is only

53
0:05:12.640 --> 0:05:16.680
one part of it. All right. So one of the nice things about this protocol is it's actually

54
0:05:16.680 --> 0:05:20.920
heavily privacy focused. So you can imagine also at that time there was a lot of concern

55
0:05:20.920 --> 0:05:24.720
about the fact that you're sending beacons out on your mobile phone. There are privacy

56
0:05:24.720 --> 0:05:29.200
concerns about that. And the protocol tries to address that in a very careful way. And

57
0:05:29.200 --> 0:05:34.400
that's actually rather a nice feature about it. All right. So when it was released this

58
0:05:34.400 --> 0:05:40.560
is actually a slide from Google and Apple. I did not draw these pictures. And this basically

59
0:05:40.560 --> 0:05:49.440
describes how it works. So very briefly, Alice and Bob wandering around the world, they have

60
0:05:49.440 --> 0:05:53.960
the app installed on their device sending out beacons. When they get into close contact

61
0:05:53.960 --> 0:05:58.760
with each other, their phones are communicating via Bluetooth. Well, they're not exactly communicating.

62
0:05:58.760 --> 0:06:02.960
They're listening for these beacons and they're storing the beacons that they hear. OK. So

63
0:06:02.960 --> 0:06:07.240
that's that's step one. So when they get close to each other, Bob's beacons get stored on

64
0:06:07.240 --> 0:06:16.840
Alice's phone. Later on, Bob turns out to have COVID and he gets a positive diagnosis.

65
0:06:16.840 --> 0:06:23.920
And he basically goes to his doctor. He gets an official diagnosis. And he puts that information

66
0:06:23.920 --> 0:06:30.920
into the app. And he voluntarily uploads data about his beacons to some cloud server that's

67
0:06:30.920 --> 0:06:37.160
run by a government or health authority. And he uploads 14 days worth of his beacons. So

68
0:06:37.160 --> 0:06:42.200
in practice, these beacons are actually generated using a cryptographic process. So you don't

69
0:06:42.200 --> 0:06:47.320
have to store on your phone 14 days worth. You just store essentially the seed that generates

70
0:06:47.320 --> 0:06:53.440
them. But they change frequently. So they change between every 10 and 20 minutes. It's

71
0:06:53.440 --> 0:06:57.840
actually a random interval somewhere between those two. In order to prevent people from

72
0:06:57.840 --> 0:07:02.120
tracking you, they are unlinkable. So when they change, you can't link one from the other.

73
0:07:02.120 --> 0:07:07.160
And that means that there's a limit to how far you can track people. But Bob can regenerate

74
0:07:07.160 --> 0:07:13.560
those keys to upload to the server. Alice just gets random, essentially random numbers.

75
0:07:13.560 --> 0:07:19.520
She can't tell what those numbers are essentially or what they mean. So then later on, so I

76
0:07:19.520 --> 0:07:23.400
guess the next day. So this happens later. But then the next day or later on that day,

77
0:07:23.400 --> 0:07:27.960
the keys get uploaded to the server and the server then dumps all of the keys that it's

78
0:07:27.960 --> 0:07:32.600
received, received back to every single device out there. It downloads these keys to all of

79
0:07:32.600 --> 0:07:36.840
their phones, to everyone's phones. So it downloads them to Alice's phone. Alice then

80
0:07:36.840 --> 0:07:42.840
Alice's phone then matches them up with the keys that she captured along the way. And

81
0:07:42.840 --> 0:07:47.980
she then knows that she was in contact with someone who has a positive diagnosis for COVID.

82
0:07:47.980 --> 0:07:52.360
She gets an alert on her app and then her life is held for two weeks. That's basically

83
0:07:52.360 --> 0:07:58.640
the process. She has to isolate and go through all of the steps that you have to go through.

84
0:07:58.640 --> 0:08:09.520
We don't know whether Alice has COVID or not, the idea is she might have. So at the time

85
0:08:09.520 --> 0:08:12.860
it was a kind of a big deal, like I said, because it was seen as a kind of a white horse

86
0:08:12.860 --> 0:08:16.400
to get us out of the problem of COVID. At that time, everyone was focused on this thing

87
0:08:16.400 --> 0:08:21.400
called the R number, where the idea being that the R number was the number of people

88
0:08:21.400 --> 0:08:25.120
you essentially go on to reinfect after you have COVID. And the objective was to keep

89
0:08:25.120 --> 0:08:29.340
that down. If the R number was above one, there was an exponential growth in the number

90
0:08:29.340 --> 0:08:33.440
of people that would have COVID. If it was below one, then it would be reducing numbers.

91
0:08:33.440 --> 0:08:37.640
And the aim of all of this process was to keep people isolated if they might have COVID

92
0:08:37.640 --> 0:08:45.040
in order to reduce that R number and prevent it from spreading. Google and Apple came out

93
0:08:45.040 --> 0:08:48.660
with this protocol because they immediately identified that there were going to be serious

94
0:08:48.660 --> 0:08:57.120
risks involved in tracking people with their mobile phone to do this stuff. So they knew,

95
0:08:57.120 --> 0:09:00.520
for example, that there were privacy risks associated with it. They knew that if they

96
0:09:00.520 --> 0:09:04.120
let governments go ahead and just do it, they would just collect everyone's data, was the

97
0:09:04.120 --> 0:09:08.080
concern. Or some of them might do. Maybe not all of them, but some of them might. They

98
0:09:08.080 --> 0:09:11.680
also knew that sending out Bluetooth beacons... Sorry, you have a question.

99
0:09:11.680 --> 0:09:18.680
Sorry, if Alice receives keys from infected people, can she not match back with the time,

100
0:09:18.680 --> 0:09:25.680
relative time she got the re-elected key? So she knows that the key is the one that she

101
0:09:25.680 --> 0:09:32.920
found two days ago, and two days ago was the time she met Bob. So is there a problem?

102
0:09:32.920 --> 0:09:38.240
So I guess I should make clear. So I mean, there are privacy controls in this, but they're

103
0:09:38.240 --> 0:09:44.120
not complete. And the idea is that essentially at the point when you upload your keys, you've

104
0:09:44.120 --> 0:09:51.640
got your diagnosis, that's essentially when some of your privacy is lost. But you voluntarily

105
0:09:51.640 --> 0:09:57.200
choose to do that. That doesn't happen automatically. Does that make sense? Okay. But it's a good

106
0:09:57.200 --> 0:10:02.560
point. So yes, but Google and Apple were concerned about the privacy implications because it

107
0:10:02.560 --> 0:10:08.200
reflects badly on their systems, if their phones are doing this stuff. Also, the power

108
0:10:08.200 --> 0:10:13.160
consumption is a problem, so they didn't want organizations to deploy apps that would have

109
0:10:13.160 --> 0:10:17.360
problems in terms of battery on their phone. And they also wanted it to be effective, because

110
0:10:17.360 --> 0:10:20.680
if it's not effective, that also reflects badly on them. So they identified that there

111
0:10:20.680 --> 0:10:25.560
were all these risks that they wanted to avoid. And even at that time, the APIs that Google

112
0:10:25.560 --> 0:10:30.200
and Apple provide prevented people from doing this kind of stuff for precisely those reasons.

113
0:10:30.200 --> 0:10:33.040
I mean, it was nothing to do with COVID. I mean, they've always just prevented you from

114
0:10:33.040 --> 0:10:37.960
sending out beacons and collecting beacons like this in a sensible way. Primarily for

115
0:10:37.960 --> 0:10:41.520
power consumption reasons, right? They don't want people draining the battery of the phone

116
0:10:41.520 --> 0:10:51.200
to do that. So my concern as a YOLO employee was that, well, Google and Apple have released

117
0:10:51.200 --> 0:10:56.000
this stuff. It's probably going to get quite popular. And I didn't want selfish users who

118
0:10:56.000 --> 0:11:00.440
are using an alternative operating system, which is not Android or iOS, to essentially

119
0:11:00.440 --> 0:11:04.360
get sidelined by this process and be left in a situation where they can't basically

120
0:11:04.360 --> 0:11:11.280
participate in this scheme. So the objective then was to create an open source implementation

121
0:11:11.280 --> 0:11:16.360
that could be used on other sorts of phones. So this is selfish. Selfish OS is a version

122
0:11:16.360 --> 0:11:25.360
of Linux, it's a Linux distribution that has a Qt UI layer on top of it. And it is sold

123
0:11:25.360 --> 0:11:30.800
by, well, it's released by YOLO. And then there is also a paid for license that you

124
0:11:30.800 --> 0:11:36.880
can get for it to get additions on top of that. So yeah, the idea was to write an application

125
0:11:36.880 --> 0:11:45.720
that essentially mimicked that functionality. And so this was the app that myself and Oscar

126
0:11:45.720 --> 0:11:50.680
Roseler, I don't know if Oscar is here. Is Oscar in there? I guess not. He said he might

127
0:11:50.680 --> 0:11:55.880
turn up, but I guess he's not here at the moment. So we developed this together as a

128
0:11:55.880 --> 0:12:01.000
kind of a personal project. And you can see here's the process. This was like the first

129
0:12:01.000 --> 0:12:05.520
time that we actually got beacons appearing on the device. So that was kind of an exciting

130
0:12:05.520 --> 0:12:10.720
moment. And there are, I guess, several steps. There's the collecting beacons, there's sending

131
0:12:10.720 --> 0:12:16.200
beacons, and there's also uploading your data if you get a positive diagnosis. So we implemented

132
0:12:16.200 --> 0:12:20.400
all those parts. And we tried to implement it in the same way that the Google and Apple

133
0:12:20.400 --> 0:12:24.160
did in terms of structure. So you have a service underneath that sends out these beacons. And

134
0:12:24.160 --> 0:12:28.200
we had a separate app, which was the app that was the equivalent to the app that had to

135
0:12:28.200 --> 0:12:32.880
be developed by governments. And in theory, other people could have developed other apps

136
0:12:32.880 --> 0:12:37.720
on top of the service. I don't think that ever happened. We only implemented one version.

137
0:12:37.720 --> 0:12:42.280
And the version we implemented was the COVID warn app, which was Germany's implementation.

138
0:12:42.280 --> 0:12:47.520
And the reason we did that was because it was both very early in the process in terms

139
0:12:47.520 --> 0:12:51.800
of being deployed. But it was also incredibly open. It was an open source deployment. And

140
0:12:51.800 --> 0:12:58.920
they were really committed to doing it as an open source project. Not just an open source

141
0:12:58.920 --> 0:13:04.480
chunk of code, but the development model was also supposed to be open. It was actually

142
0:13:04.480 --> 0:13:09.040
developed by SAP and Deutsche Telekom. I think my understanding is that SAP did all the code

143
0:13:09.040 --> 0:13:13.560
development. Deutsche Telekom provided the infrastructure for it, the back end service

144
0:13:13.560 --> 0:13:20.760
infrastructure. So like I say, we did this independently of Yola. For those interested,

145
0:13:20.760 --> 0:13:25.720
it was Qt based. It used Bluetooth for the Bluetooth stack and open SSL for the crypto

146
0:13:25.720 --> 0:13:33.720
stuff. And this was the timeline, essentially, that we worked to. We didn't work to that

147
0:13:33.720 --> 0:13:38.240
we ended up with, I guess. So on the 10th of April, that's when the Google Apple specs

148
0:13:38.240 --> 0:13:43.640
first came out. We released our first version implementation of those specs on the 19th.

149
0:13:43.640 --> 0:13:48.880
So that was quite soon afterwards. Then the COVID warn app from Germany came out on the

150
0:13:48.880 --> 0:13:54.040
16th of June. And then on the 30th of June, so quite a few weeks later, but we got out

151
0:13:54.040 --> 0:14:02.080
our first app that had equivalent functionality. So we were pretty happy with that. We thought

152
0:14:02.080 --> 0:14:08.080
that was kind of could be considered a success. But it was only possible because the specifications

153
0:14:08.080 --> 0:14:11.600
that Google and Apple rolled out were very good. They were clear specifications that

154
0:14:11.600 --> 0:14:19.480
you could re implement. And the COVID warn app team also did a lot of good work in releasing

155
0:14:19.480 --> 0:14:24.920
source code very early. They had a huge amount of documentation that was all on GitHub. They

156
0:14:24.920 --> 0:14:35.880
even had a, I guess, a CCC evaluation of the project in terms of its privacy. So they were

157
0:14:35.880 --> 0:14:42.960
really quite committed to being open with their stuff. In practice, what we found was,

158
0:14:42.960 --> 0:14:51.960
so they released some reference versions of the servers. And we found that really helpful.

159
0:14:51.960 --> 0:14:57.520
That was really important. They also released the source code for their app that we re implemented.

160
0:14:57.520 --> 0:15:00.760
We actually ultimately found that that was not so useful. It was useful for some edge

161
0:15:00.760 --> 0:15:09.760
cases, but really it was a server deployment that was really helpful for us. So I guess

162
0:15:09.760 --> 0:15:14.040
the real reason that I wanted to talk today was to talk about our experience working with

163
0:15:14.040 --> 0:15:20.440
these companies as small developers, as independent developers. And I guess it was very much as

164
0:15:20.440 --> 0:15:24.480
you might expect in terms of Google and Apple. They produce, I mean, they re phenomenal at

165
0:15:24.480 --> 0:15:27.800
producing good specifications and good APIs. That s what they do. That s their bread and

166
0:15:27.800 --> 0:15:32.920
butter. They re absolutely phenomenal at it. But zero engagement. So we tried to contact

167
0:15:32.920 --> 0:15:38.680
them and talk to them about their stuff to try and get information or to get help. Nothing

168
0:15:38.680 --> 0:15:42.720
at all. Which is, I guess, not surprising, right? They re a massive company. There s

169
0:15:42.720 --> 0:15:50.080
no reason why particularly they would. They promised test data to test stuff against and

170
0:15:50.080 --> 0:15:55.640
that never materialized. So there were also some bumps in the road for us. And although

171
0:15:55.640 --> 0:16:00.360
they did release the source code, they released the source code for an app, for a reference

172
0:16:00.360 --> 0:16:04.160
app quite early, but they didn t release the source code for the underlying system, the

173
0:16:04.160 --> 0:16:11.760
Bluetooth system, until somewhat later. Until I guess that was late in July. So for us that

174
0:16:11.760 --> 0:16:17.320
was already too late. So working with them, like I say, there were good points, but they

175
0:16:17.320 --> 0:16:24.680
were not really having an open source development model. For SAP, working with the SAP code was

176
0:16:24.680 --> 0:16:30.640
a little bit different. So this is essentially the SAP implementation that they developed

177
0:16:30.640 --> 0:16:36.880
on top of the Google Apple notification protocol. So this is the app and this is the server

178
0:16:36.880 --> 0:16:43.480
backend on the left-hand side. And the main parts of it are this verification server and

179
0:16:43.480 --> 0:16:47.320
from our point of view, in the Corona Warn app server. So essentially what they do, you

180
0:16:47.320 --> 0:16:50.240
have to have a download server to download all of these keys that are going to Alice

181
0:16:50.240 --> 0:16:56.240
s phone and to everybody s phone. That happened in the Corona Warn app server. You have to

182
0:16:56.240 --> 0:17:02.520
have a verification server so that when you get a positive diagnosis, you can upload it

183
0:17:02.520 --> 0:17:06.760
in a secure way with your identity, essentially proving that, not with your identity, but

184
0:17:06.760 --> 0:17:11.000
proving that you ve got a positive diagnosis from your doctor. And then you need an upload

185
0:17:11.000 --> 0:17:15.320
server to upload your keys to. And that happened also in the Corona Warn app server. So in

186
0:17:15.320 --> 0:17:19.240
practice this was actually two servers, not one. So those were the two bits we were interested

187
0:17:19.240 --> 0:17:26.080
in. And we had to deploy them to test against. We couldn t deploy the whole lot. That was

188
0:17:26.080 --> 0:17:30.400
going to be impossible. That was not really a plausible thing to do. But they did have

189
0:17:30.400 --> 0:17:34.880
a reference implementation of these two servers. And so we tried to deploy, we tried to deploy,

190
0:17:34.880 --> 0:17:39.680
well, so we did end up deploying those to an AWS server and testing our code against

191
0:17:39.680 --> 0:17:44.360
those. And what we found was that the download server implementation was a little bit broken.

192
0:17:44.360 --> 0:17:50.960
We had to fix it. But it was otherwise pretty good. There were just some glitches. Whereas

193
0:17:50.960 --> 0:17:55.640
the verification server and the upload server were pretty minimal. So we actually essentially

194
0:17:55.640 --> 0:18:01.600
had to re-implement parts of those based on the specification in order to do our testing.

195
0:18:01.600 --> 0:18:04.400
But they did release a lot of code with this stuff. And the fact that they had these reference

196
0:18:04.400 --> 0:18:12.280
servers was absolutely key in allowing us to re-implement the protocol. So our overall

197
0:18:12.280 --> 0:18:18.520
experience was that they produced lots of code and lots of documentation, which was

198
0:18:18.520 --> 0:18:28.000
really good. They were one of the earliest teams to get this stuff out into the wild,

199
0:18:28.000 --> 0:18:34.120
in terms of source code, which was also phenomenally good. They worked through GitHub issues. So

200
0:18:34.120 --> 0:18:40.400
when we found problems, we would submit pull requests to try and fix the code. And it was

201
0:18:40.400 --> 0:18:44.520
clear that they were trying to engage with that process. But in practice, they were just

202
0:18:44.520 --> 0:18:50.120
taking way too long. So by the time, so for example, we would fix a bit of a, we would

203
0:18:50.120 --> 0:18:56.960
fix something in one of the reference servers. And people would be using our PR code to deploy

204
0:18:56.960 --> 0:19:01.320
elsewhere. But by the time they got to actually thinking about integrating it, it was already

205
0:19:01.320 --> 0:19:07.840
too stale. It was no longer useful. So they were clearly trying to do that. But I guess

206
0:19:07.840 --> 0:19:13.600
it was just a question of time. So as a consequence, some of the code was left broken for quite

207
0:19:13.600 --> 0:19:18.920
a long time, even though there were fixes that they could have just integrated. Some

208
0:19:18.920 --> 0:19:23.640
of the reference implementations differed quite significantly from reality in terms of

209
0:19:23.640 --> 0:19:29.480
the servers. But there was something to work with, and that was really helpful. And so

210
0:19:29.480 --> 0:19:32.840
our overall impression was that they had this real commitment to openness. They were genuinely

211
0:19:32.840 --> 0:19:37.800
committed to doing this well. They had an open development process. But the team were

212
0:19:37.800 --> 0:19:40.560
just a bit overwhelmed with the amount of effort involved in doing it. That was the

213
0:19:40.560 --> 0:19:47.240
impression we got from the outside. So we were very impressed by this. But obviously,

214
0:19:47.240 --> 0:19:54.040
there's obviously scope for learning there in terms of how to do it better. So my overall

215
0:19:54.040 --> 0:20:02.480
reflections on how things went were that at the time, I think, again, you have to put

216
0:20:02.480 --> 0:20:07.040
this into context. There was huge pressure on governments all over the world to get this

217
0:20:07.040 --> 0:20:14.360
stuff deployed. So the first deployment in South Korea was, I think, the COVID 100-meter

218
0:20:14.360 --> 0:20:19.280
app. And that went out really early. And as soon as that went out, and that used a GPS

219
0:20:19.280 --> 0:20:26.800
position in GNSS so that it uploaded people's locations to the cloud. I mean, essentially,

220
0:20:26.800 --> 0:20:32.080
zero privacy in that situation. But as soon as that was out, all other governments, there

221
0:20:32.080 --> 0:20:36.240
was a lot of pressure for them to do something similar. There was a huge rush to deploy this

222
0:20:36.240 --> 0:20:40.560
stuff. And so there was a lot of pressure. And there was a lot of competing requirements.

223
0:20:40.560 --> 0:20:43.680
There were a lot of competing requirements. The requirements for openness was just one

224
0:20:43.680 --> 0:20:49.960
requirement. There was also requirements for efficacy, requirements for speed, requirements

225
0:20:49.960 --> 0:20:56.840
in terms of privacy. All of these things combined are actually quite challenging to get right.

226
0:20:56.840 --> 0:21:02.360
And both Google and Apple and the CWA team, the SAP team, the impression I got was they

227
0:21:02.360 --> 0:21:05.960
really got that. They really understood these competing impressions, but they also understood

228
0:21:05.960 --> 0:21:11.040
the need for openness. They understood that in order for people, not just for them to

229
0:21:11.040 --> 0:21:14.720
do it well, but for people to trust the apps that they were running, they also needed to

230
0:21:14.720 --> 0:21:18.440
be open about it. And that's one of the reasons they did it. And in that sense, I think they

231
0:21:18.440 --> 0:21:25.600
were pretty successful. Like I say, there was scope for improvement. There was, as I

232
0:21:25.600 --> 0:21:29.680
said, with Google and Apple, there was zero inward flow of information. With SAP, there

233
0:21:29.680 --> 0:21:34.240
was, and so with both teams, there was a lot of outward flow of information that was excellent.

234
0:21:34.240 --> 0:21:39.400
With SAP, there was some inward flow, but not as much as perhaps we as independent developers

235
0:21:39.400 --> 0:21:46.520
would have liked. And I guess more generally, what we kind of felt was that there was a,

236
0:21:46.520 --> 0:21:50.680
there was this commitment to openness, but not necessarily a full appreciation of how

237
0:21:50.680 --> 0:21:55.040
much effort was involved in that process, in getting that process to work really well

238
0:21:55.040 --> 0:22:01.400
and effectively for the companies involved. So for example, and I guess I should say that

239
0:22:01.400 --> 0:22:05.360
YOLA also works with a lot of open source code. So we also have an open development

240
0:22:05.360 --> 0:22:11.280
process for a lot of our stuff and we have the same challenges, right? So people provide

241
0:22:11.280 --> 0:22:15.960
PRs for us to integrate into the system and knowing what is good to integrate and what

242
0:22:15.960 --> 0:22:20.520
is bad to integrate takes a lot of time and effort, right? It sounds like you're getting

243
0:22:20.520 --> 0:22:24.240
free implementation, which I guess in some sense you are, but there's still a lot of

244
0:22:24.240 --> 0:22:29.120
effort involved in that process. And like I said, I guess with this process that we

245
0:22:29.120 --> 0:22:34.120
as independent developers experienced from the outside, it felt like that perhaps these

246
0:22:34.120 --> 0:22:41.560
other competing things were impacting on the effort that they could put into that process.

247
0:22:41.560 --> 0:22:47.000
So yeah, so overall, given that these organizations had absolutely no duty towards us as independent

248
0:22:47.000 --> 0:22:51.800
developers, we were kind of very happy that we could work with the things that they've

249
0:22:51.800 --> 0:22:55.080
given us and that they were actually high quality. So we were very pleased with how

250
0:22:55.080 --> 0:22:59.920
it went, but like I say, we felt that there was definitely some room for improvement.

251
0:22:59.920 --> 0:23:05.920
Okay, so that's my summary of how things went. Thanks for taking the time to listen. There's

252
0:23:05.920 --> 0:23:10.960
some links in case you're interested in more. We are actually on the Linux on mobile stand

253
0:23:10.960 --> 0:23:15.360
in Building K at the top of the stairs. So if you want to talk more about it later, please

254
0:23:15.360 --> 0:23:27.360
come and visit us and we'd be happy to do that. Thanks very much. Is there time for

255
0:23:27.360 --> 0:23:28.360
questions?

256
0:23:28.360 --> 0:23:46.360
Okay, especially for the live stream. Right. Understood.

257
0:23:46.360 --> 0:24:06.640
Right. So your question is, what's my experience with the Bluetooth parts, the Bluetooth notifications?

258
0:24:06.640 --> 0:24:10.320
Because as you were saying, at the time there was a lot of discussion about whether it was

259
0:24:10.320 --> 0:24:16.040
going to give enough accuracy in terms of proximity detection. So the key thing, the

260
0:24:16.040 --> 0:24:22.160
key thing with the COVID notifications, of course, is that there was this two meter,

261
0:24:22.160 --> 0:24:27.240
there was always this like, or some distance that you were supposed to stay away from people.

262
0:24:27.240 --> 0:24:31.400
And so in terms of the Bluetooth, you wanted to try and mimic that process. You wanted

263
0:24:31.400 --> 0:24:35.960
to actually distinguish that someone was within two meters or some distance or outside that

264
0:24:35.960 --> 0:24:41.520
distance. Right. That's essentially what you're talking about in terms of proximity. So it's

265
0:24:41.520 --> 0:24:48.000
interesting actually. So when we started out the process, the protocol didn't specify greatly

266
0:24:48.000 --> 0:24:52.520
how to tackle that. So what happened, what actually Google and Apple did is they set

267
0:24:52.520 --> 0:24:58.360
a bunch of risk parameters in their implementation that you could tweak, that you could change.

268
0:24:58.360 --> 0:25:03.120
And they came from the download server. They were set by the government organizations,

269
0:25:03.120 --> 0:25:08.160
not by Google and Apple. And they basically said, you know, how much risk do you, they

270
0:25:08.160 --> 0:25:13.440
gave weightings, how much risk do you associate with a power level of this for the Bluetooth?

271
0:25:13.440 --> 0:25:18.880
And how much risk association do you put with how long that association went on for? Like,

272
0:25:18.880 --> 0:25:23.240
is it five minutes or 10 minutes that they're within range of this, of this distance? So

273
0:25:23.240 --> 0:25:29.320
you could tweak those parameters. And later on in the process, Google actually released

274
0:25:29.320 --> 0:25:36.800
a lot of information that provided essentially weightings for some of the parameters that

275
0:25:36.800 --> 0:25:41.200
almost every phone on the market. So they had a process where they would basically put

276
0:25:41.200 --> 0:25:47.120
two phones on stands next to each other and measure the power consumption that came through.

277
0:25:47.120 --> 0:25:52.440
And then based on which phone was communicating with it, which other phone, they would then

278
0:25:52.440 --> 0:25:57.840
tweak the parameters to try and make that proximity more effective. So we, so we, we

279
0:25:57.840 --> 0:26:02.720
use those parameters, but I have to say we didn't really, we were not in a position to

280
0:26:02.720 --> 0:26:07.000
check whether or not they were working effectively because what's happening behind the scene

281
0:26:07.000 --> 0:26:11.440
is quite opaque, right? We're sending data upload up to a server. And the whole point

282
0:26:11.440 --> 0:26:16.200
is that you then know nothing about what happens after that because of the privacy aspects.

283
0:26:16.200 --> 0:26:21.040
So, so it's actually very hard for us to judge whether or not it was working well or working

284
0:26:21.040 --> 0:26:26.400
badly. But it was clear that there was a lot of work going on to get it to work well in

285
0:26:26.400 --> 0:26:32.680
the background. My, my, my more general experience with Bluetooth is it's not great at this stuff.

286
0:26:32.680 --> 0:26:37.480
You know, if there's a person between you and another person, then water is a big problem

287
0:26:37.480 --> 0:26:43.160
for signal propagation. So stuff that's in between causes a lot of dampening of the,

288
0:26:43.160 --> 0:26:47.920
of the signal. So it's quite tough. It was the impression I got. Yeah, but I'm not an

289
0:26:47.920 --> 0:26:49.920
expert in that. I have to say.

290
0:26:49.920 --> 0:26:50.920
Okay.

291
0:26:50.920 --> 0:26:51.920
Okay.

292
0:26:51.920 --> 0:27:05.440
So I'm just going to come a bit closer so I can hear from you.

293
0:27:05.440 --> 0:27:23.320
Right.

294
0:27:23.320 --> 0:27:37.400
Right. Okay. So, so the question, the question was, is, was there any evidence that all of

295
0:27:37.400 --> 0:27:41.880
this open source release of code resulted in reuse of code by other governments? That's

296
0:27:41.880 --> 0:27:47.200
essentially your question, right? And I think there was, so I can't think of specific instances,

297
0:27:47.200 --> 0:27:51.320
but my understanding was that, that people did take the COVID war nap code and use it

298
0:27:51.320 --> 0:27:55.640
in their implementations or perhaps more generally, I think people definitely took the Google

299
0:27:55.640 --> 0:28:00.000
reference implementation and use that in their code, which was open source. And of course

300
0:28:00.000 --> 0:28:06.560
was a, was a yes. I'm sorry. Which was, which I guess was an example of open source being

301
0:28:06.560 --> 0:28:14.560
reused. Perhaps more specifically with the COVID war nap because the Google and Apple

302
0:28:14.560 --> 0:28:18.640
notification protocol was the foundation for it. It was used really quite widely across

303
0:28:18.640 --> 0:28:23.000
Europe. Not all countries used it, but a lot of countries did. And at this point in time,

304
0:28:23.000 --> 0:28:28.960
I think there's 11 countries that all use the same backend. So they're all uploading

305
0:28:28.960 --> 0:28:35.040
their keys to servers. So now if you use the COVID war nap, you or contract our version

306
