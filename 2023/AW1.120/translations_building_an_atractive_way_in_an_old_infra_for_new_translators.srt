1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.480
Okay. Hi folks.

2
0:00:07.480 --> 0:00:09.360
Thanks for this talk.

3
0:00:09.360 --> 0:00:12.840
I wanted also to thanks for them and

4
0:00:12.840 --> 0:00:16.980
the organizers here for this Dev Room because I'm very happy

5
0:00:16.980 --> 0:00:20.160
that the translation to make part of

6
0:00:20.160 --> 0:00:23.000
the topics in such important events.

7
0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:25.520
So it's a very good news, I think.

8
0:00:25.520 --> 0:00:29.640
Well, I wanted to propose this talk because,

9
0:00:29.640 --> 0:00:32.760
well, personally, I have

10
0:00:32.760 --> 0:00:36.920
started Free Software in 2004 and I have

11
0:00:36.920 --> 0:00:41.240
done some contributions to the Debian project for a long time.

12
0:00:41.240 --> 0:00:46.480
But I only started translation in this project.

13
0:00:46.480 --> 0:00:50.080
I have started that since 2018.

14
0:00:50.080 --> 0:00:52.960
Well, I told myself,

15
0:00:52.960 --> 0:00:58.080
how could we help new contributors,

16
0:00:58.080 --> 0:01:01.600
new users, new potential commerce to help

17
0:01:01.600 --> 0:01:05.200
the translations team with

18
0:01:05.200 --> 0:01:08.720
the capabilities that Debian can provide for them,

19
0:01:08.720 --> 0:01:12.280
and also with what Debian can't provide.

20
0:01:12.280 --> 0:01:15.200
It's also what we're going to see and we're going to see why.

21
0:01:15.200 --> 0:01:17.640
It's not so easy actually.

22
0:01:17.640 --> 0:01:19.960
So I told myself also,

23
0:01:19.960 --> 0:01:23.360
well, I'm sure some people think that,

24
0:01:23.360 --> 0:01:25.440
oh, but why Debian doesn't choose

25
0:01:25.440 --> 0:01:30.640
modern tools such as woodlates or such as model for editors,

26
0:01:30.640 --> 0:01:32.880
or things like that.

27
0:01:32.880 --> 0:01:35.760
So I had the thought about that.

28
0:01:35.760 --> 0:01:37.640
I told myself, well,

29
0:01:37.640 --> 0:01:40.680
why not share that with people to

30
0:01:40.680 --> 0:01:43.840
understand why Debian works like that and how

31
0:01:43.840 --> 0:01:49.920
a new user could contribute with this way of working.

32
0:01:49.920 --> 0:01:53.400
We thought no problem and we had problems.

33
0:01:53.400 --> 0:01:57.160
Well, we've had this faction.

34
0:01:57.160 --> 0:01:59.480
So the example I take is of course,

35
0:01:59.480 --> 0:02:02.760
this is a French translation team because it's the team,

36
0:02:02.760 --> 0:02:05.120
I know the best of course.

37
0:02:05.120 --> 0:02:07.920
It's a very small team.

38
0:02:07.920 --> 0:02:10.520
It's a very, very small team as you see,

39
0:02:10.520 --> 0:02:12.640
there are few people.

40
0:02:12.640 --> 0:02:15.560
There have been people for a long time,

41
0:02:15.560 --> 0:02:19.800
but it's never a team with 10 or 20 persons.

42
0:02:19.800 --> 0:02:21.800
No, it's a very, very small team.

43
0:02:21.800 --> 0:02:26.880
Also, it's not a team which have a lot of technical skills.

44
0:02:26.880 --> 0:02:30.080
I mean, there are some Debian developers,

45
0:02:30.080 --> 0:02:33.640
but which were technical,

46
0:02:33.640 --> 0:02:35.560
there are one or two.

47
0:02:35.560 --> 0:02:39.480
Most other Debian developers of this team are not uploaders.

48
0:02:39.480 --> 0:02:43.480
That is, they are not considered,

49
0:02:43.480 --> 0:02:46.200
or they're not considered themselves able to do

50
0:02:46.200 --> 0:02:48.560
uploads of new packages or things like that.

51
0:02:48.560 --> 0:02:50.880
So it's not a technical team.

52
0:02:50.880 --> 0:02:55.880
It's really a translation team and not a technical team.

53
0:02:57.800 --> 0:03:01.520
And amazing results are produced by this team.

54
0:03:01.520 --> 0:03:03.480
I mean that it's a very small team,

55
0:03:03.480 --> 0:03:05.560
but very amazing results exist.

56
0:03:07.800 --> 0:03:11.480
For example, we have all the things we translate

57
0:03:11.480 --> 0:03:15.200
and we know that we are the third language

58
0:03:15.200 --> 0:03:17.640
best translated in the project.

59
0:03:17.640 --> 0:03:21.520
And when we see the amount of work which is needed

60
0:03:21.520 --> 0:03:25.440
to get that, I think the team may be very happy.

61
0:03:26.600 --> 0:03:30.120
And I can say it because I don't make part of all the team

62
0:03:30.120 --> 0:03:32.120
and I don't make part of all these projects,

63
0:03:32.120 --> 0:03:34.840
so congratulations to other members of the staff.

64
0:03:35.920 --> 0:03:38.880
So the websites, the installer,

65
0:03:38.880 --> 0:03:41.040
all the things which are translated

66
0:03:41.040 --> 0:03:44.600
from up to nearly 100%,

67
0:03:44.600 --> 0:03:49.600
the Debian package descriptions, which are not translated,

68
0:03:49.880 --> 0:03:54.560
of course, very much, but the most important are translated

69
0:03:54.560 --> 0:03:56.840
and it's very important for us also

70
0:03:56.840 --> 0:04:00.680
to enable French users to get the package description,

71
0:04:00.680 --> 0:04:03.800
at least for those they have more chance to use.

72
0:04:05.080 --> 0:04:08.640
So I think it's very, an amazing result

73
0:04:08.640 --> 0:04:13.640
when we know the real size of the team.

74
0:04:15.000 --> 0:04:18.680
Then we work for a project

75
0:04:18.680 --> 0:04:23.440
which has been a very long history, as you know.

76
0:04:23.440 --> 0:04:27.320
The first message, I was very happy to discover that,

77
0:04:27.320 --> 0:04:28.680
preparing this talk.

78
0:04:28.680 --> 0:04:31.640
The first message of the Debian translation team

79
0:04:31.640 --> 0:04:36.120
for French is in 1998, it's very old.

80
0:04:36.120 --> 0:04:41.000
The world has changed very much since this year, of course,

81
0:04:41.000 --> 0:04:43.320
and in particular, the technical world.

82
0:04:43.320 --> 0:04:48.160
So of course, the process, the workflow,

83
0:04:48.160 --> 0:04:50.360
is made based today.

84
0:04:50.360 --> 0:04:54.760
And we have webpages, webpages which enable

85
0:04:54.760 --> 0:04:57.800
to have a tracking of the situations

86
0:04:57.800 --> 0:05:00.800
and to have some statistics and to have some information,

87
0:05:00.800 --> 0:05:03.960
some bots who automate some things

88
0:05:03.960 --> 0:05:07.720
and also some statistics and some made based

89
0:05:07.720 --> 0:05:11.080
to have a workflow between the members of the team

90
0:05:11.080 --> 0:05:14.800
to ensure that the translation has a good quality.

91
0:05:18.880 --> 0:05:21.680
The tools, as I said, are made based.

92
0:05:21.680 --> 0:05:25.480
That is, on the Debian mailing list,

93
0:05:25.480 --> 0:05:29.320
the Debian mailing list for the team, the French team,

94
0:05:29.320 --> 0:05:36.320
there is a bot who is able to receive the topics,

95
0:05:36.320 --> 0:05:39.880
the subject of the messages sent by the member of the list,

96
0:05:39.880 --> 0:05:44.840
to pass them and to produce statistics from this

97
0:05:44.840 --> 0:05:48.800
and to produce some status of the packages or the pages we

98
0:05:48.800 --> 0:05:51.440
are translating.

99
0:05:51.440 --> 0:05:52.920
So it's very important, of course,

100
0:05:52.920 --> 0:05:56.560
because it enables all the members of the team

101
0:05:56.560 --> 0:06:00.520
to know if, for example, someone is working on something

102
0:06:00.520 --> 0:06:03.800
or the status of something, if it's up to date,

103
0:06:03.800 --> 0:06:08.760
or if it's not up to date, or other information like that.

104
0:06:08.760 --> 0:06:14.560
So the thing, of course, is, well, what

105
0:06:14.560 --> 0:06:17.480
can we do with the made based process,

106
0:06:17.480 --> 0:06:20.280
given the number of things we have to do?

107
0:06:20.280 --> 0:06:23.120
Well, we track the changes, so it's very important.

108
0:06:23.120 --> 0:06:27.400
We can know the status of the translations.

109
0:06:27.400 --> 0:06:32.160
And even if we've stopped working for a long time,

110
0:06:32.160 --> 0:06:35.480
we are able, easily, to join the team again

111
0:06:35.480 --> 0:06:40.320
and to know what the situation and what about the situation.

112
0:06:40.320 --> 0:06:43.280
There are also coordination pages,

113
0:06:43.280 --> 0:06:47.880
so with the tracking pages, which enable to do that.

114
0:06:47.880 --> 0:06:50.280
So we have the analysis for the websites.

115
0:06:50.280 --> 0:06:52.400
We have the package translated.

116
0:06:52.400 --> 0:06:57.960
We are, via profiles, packages are translated,

117
0:06:57.960 --> 0:07:01.440
because they are classical programs.

118
0:07:01.440 --> 0:07:06.280
So they use get text as many programs today.

119
0:07:06.280 --> 0:07:09.360
Also descriptions of the depth core screens.

120
0:07:09.360 --> 0:07:11.080
Depth core files, of course, the screens

121
0:07:11.080 --> 0:07:13.400
that the user gets when he's installing a package

122
0:07:13.400 --> 0:07:16.600
to set some configuration at the installation time.

123
0:07:16.600 --> 0:07:20.960
And the website, of course, which is a very high work.

124
0:07:20.960 --> 0:07:26.200
So I think the problem of the Debian project

125
0:07:26.200 --> 0:07:29.880
and the reason for which it's probably very difficult

126
0:07:29.880 --> 0:07:37.840
to use automated tools is that there is a lot of formats

127
0:07:37.840 --> 0:07:43.560
which are used as inputs and also outputs.

128
0:07:43.560 --> 0:07:48.960
I mean, inputs, we have at least a package description database,

129
0:07:48.960 --> 0:07:50.080
which has some formats.

130
0:07:50.080 --> 0:07:52.240
I'm not sure I know what it is about,

131
0:07:52.240 --> 0:07:56.400
but it's not a format such as profiles or HTML files.

132
0:07:56.400 --> 0:07:57.480
It's another kind of format.

133
0:07:57.480 --> 0:07:59.320
It's a database.

134
0:07:59.320 --> 0:08:02.520
HTML, of course, and the profiles.

135
0:08:02.520 --> 0:08:06.400
And for the outputs, we need to produce, of course,

136
0:08:06.400 --> 0:08:09.200
some translations, some typical translations

137
0:08:09.200 --> 0:08:12.960
we find in any other kind of programs of the free software,

138
0:08:12.960 --> 0:08:16.440
but also the websites, so HTML pages.

139
0:08:16.440 --> 0:08:21.040
And various other formats, so it's

140
0:08:21.040 --> 0:08:26.720
not so easy to ship that in a kind of automated tool

141
0:08:26.720 --> 0:08:33.480
because it's really a really quite big task of administration

142
0:08:33.480 --> 0:08:35.280
to set that initially.

143
0:08:35.280 --> 0:08:37.440
And I remember that in the team, we

144
0:08:37.440 --> 0:08:39.360
have not a lot of technical skills,

145
0:08:39.360 --> 0:08:42.880
and we are not very numerous.

146
0:08:42.880 --> 0:08:47.160
So we can understand that we prefer going out with mails,

147
0:08:47.160 --> 0:08:49.720
even if it's probably not perfect,

148
0:08:49.720 --> 0:08:52.680
but at least it enables people to work.

149
0:08:52.680 --> 0:08:55.200
While changing to another kind of tools,

150
0:08:55.200 --> 0:08:57.720
even if it would have benefits about the interface

151
0:08:57.720 --> 0:09:02.360
and the user experience, it would be really a challenge,

152
0:09:02.360 --> 0:09:04.840
a very important challenge.

153
0:09:04.840 --> 0:09:09.680
So changing is very difficult. Is it a good idea also?

154
0:09:09.680 --> 0:09:12.400
It's an idea that the team wonders sometimes.

155
0:09:12.400 --> 0:09:13.200
Is it a good idea?

156
0:09:16.840 --> 0:09:19.440
We wonder that in particular because that's right.

157
0:09:19.440 --> 0:09:22.840
There are not a lot of new contributors

158
0:09:22.840 --> 0:09:26.720
if we have a look annually.

159
0:09:26.720 --> 0:09:28.800
However, when people come and contribute

160
0:09:28.800 --> 0:09:32.480
to the translation projects in Debian, they stay with us.

161
0:09:32.480 --> 0:09:33.840
They don't leave us.

162
0:09:33.840 --> 0:09:38.680
So probably it means that once we manage to adopt the tools,

163
0:09:38.680 --> 0:09:42.440
to adopt the process, we like it,

164
0:09:42.440 --> 0:09:45.200
and people are comfortable with it.

165
0:09:45.200 --> 0:09:53.840
So even if it's not modern, once you take the care to learn it,

166
0:09:53.840 --> 0:09:57.160
at the end, I think we can be comfortable with that.

167
0:09:57.160 --> 0:10:04.080
In particular because, well, we can get things offline.

168
0:10:04.080 --> 0:10:07.360
In particular because we can take the poor

169
0:10:07.360 --> 0:10:10.600
and do some stupid things without being sure you are not

170
0:10:10.600 --> 0:10:12.800
breaking all of the process or you are not breaking

171
0:10:12.800 --> 0:10:14.720
all the translation of others.

172
0:10:14.720 --> 0:10:17.120
So I think it gives some benefits

173
0:10:17.120 --> 0:10:20.720
that people are happy to have.

174
0:10:20.720 --> 0:10:24.360
And that's the reason for which moving is difficult

175
0:10:24.360 --> 0:10:26.440
because people are happy.

176
0:10:26.440 --> 0:10:28.960
And we are not absolutely sure that changing that

177
0:10:28.960 --> 0:10:32.000
would be a good idea.

178
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:34.400
And when we try changing, for example,

179
0:10:34.400 --> 0:10:38.200
we tried to migrate the server for the package description

180
0:10:38.200 --> 0:10:41.080
to another server in Debian, it takes some year

181
0:10:41.080 --> 0:10:42.840
and it exhausted some people.

182
0:10:42.840 --> 0:10:46.840
So I'm not sure it's the best idea we can have,

183
0:10:46.840 --> 0:10:49.480
even if this migration was really important.

184
0:10:49.480 --> 0:10:54.560
But imagine if we should have a migration with more impact

185
0:10:54.560 --> 0:10:57.760
and more things to address.

186
0:10:57.760 --> 0:11:04.080
So instead of changing things, I suggest

187
0:11:04.080 --> 0:11:08.640
to propose to the users, to the new contributors,

188
0:11:08.640 --> 0:11:16.040
a kind of approach which enable everyone to, well,

189
0:11:16.040 --> 0:11:17.280
let's discover the project.

190
0:11:17.280 --> 0:11:20.280
Let's discover the interactions you can have with the team

191
0:11:20.280 --> 0:11:23.560
from the easiest to the most complex.

192
0:11:23.560 --> 0:11:29.240
And from these bases, do your way.

193
0:11:29.240 --> 0:11:30.320
Follow your way.

194
0:11:30.320 --> 0:11:37.040
And the first step, for example, is for,

195
0:11:37.040 --> 0:11:39.320
and also, yes, on every step of the way,

196
0:11:39.320 --> 0:11:42.120
the idea is also to have two kinds of status.

197
0:11:42.120 --> 0:11:43.720
So two kinds of status, we are going

198
0:11:43.720 --> 0:11:45.520
to talk about that again in a few minutes.

199
0:11:45.520 --> 0:11:50.840
But it's more or less, OK, either I am a reviewer

200
0:11:50.840 --> 0:11:53.840
and I start to understand all the conventions of the team,

201
0:11:53.840 --> 0:11:59.600
how the team works, et cetera, or I become a translator myself.

202
0:11:59.600 --> 0:12:01.880
And of course, I start to contribute

203
0:12:01.880 --> 0:12:04.360
with other translators.

204
0:12:04.360 --> 0:12:12.440
So it's a way to contribute for the rhythm of everybody.

205
0:12:12.440 --> 0:12:14.520
I suggest that the first thing you can do if you want

206
0:12:14.520 --> 0:12:17.520
to contribute, because, again, there

207
0:12:17.520 --> 0:12:19.800
are not some tools which are attractive,

208
0:12:19.800 --> 0:12:22.680
but also start with the easy thing.

209
0:12:22.680 --> 0:12:25.280
And translating the wiki pages of Debian, for example,

210
0:12:25.280 --> 0:12:28.880
would be an easy thing, because much people

211
0:12:28.880 --> 0:12:30.440
love to use a wiki.

212
0:12:30.440 --> 0:12:32.760
It's not so difficult to use.

213
0:12:32.760 --> 0:12:38.040
And using a wiki today is, well, OK, you take the page,

214
0:12:38.040 --> 0:12:39.800
you cut and paste the contents, you

215
0:12:39.800 --> 0:12:43.560
create a new page of the French wiki, and well, and it's done.

216
0:12:43.560 --> 0:12:45.480
So it's not so complicated to do.

217
0:12:45.480 --> 0:12:50.880
And it's the first step which, well,

218
0:12:50.880 --> 0:12:56.160
creates a kind of initiation training for the translation.

219
0:12:56.160 --> 0:12:58.200
We saw so much consequences for the project,

220
0:12:58.200 --> 0:13:01.960
because it's not an official resource,

221
0:13:01.960 --> 0:13:03.320
but it's a community resource.

222
0:13:03.320 --> 0:13:06.600
It's not a resource maintained by Debian members,

223
0:13:06.600 --> 0:13:10.480
so it's not a big problem if you do some mistakes or things

224
0:13:10.480 --> 0:13:12.680
like that.

225
0:13:12.680 --> 0:13:16.880
The next step is probably the package descriptions.

226
0:13:16.880 --> 0:13:19.360
It's interesting, because there are a lot of responsibilities,

227
0:13:19.360 --> 0:13:21.040
because, well, package descriptions

228
0:13:21.040 --> 0:13:23.920
are what users will see on their screen

229
0:13:23.920 --> 0:13:26.360
when they will search for a package.

230
0:13:26.360 --> 0:13:28.680
However, the interface is simple.

231
0:13:28.680 --> 0:13:30.720
It's a web interface, which is wild.

232
0:13:30.720 --> 0:13:31.840
There are some conventions.

233
0:13:31.840 --> 0:13:34.200
There are some rules to have.

234
0:13:34.200 --> 0:13:36.200
But there are also a first contact

235
0:13:36.200 --> 0:13:38.120
with the translation team.

236
0:13:38.120 --> 0:13:40.160
And it's something which is important,

237
0:13:40.160 --> 0:13:43.680
because we have people who review what you're doing.

238
0:13:43.680 --> 0:13:48.160
So you can do what you do, what Debian used to do.

239
0:13:48.160 --> 0:13:50.840
And for example, if you try to translate some things like that,

240
0:13:50.840 --> 0:13:53.480
but Debian is used to translate differently,

241
0:13:53.480 --> 0:13:54.600
you will know that.

242
0:13:54.600 --> 0:13:58.600
If you're not compliant with some kind of syntax

243
0:13:58.600 --> 0:14:01.800
or kind of a way to introduce things,

244
0:14:01.800 --> 0:14:04.320
it will be said by the member of the team.

245
0:14:04.320 --> 0:14:08.280
So it's a first responsibility, a first contact with the team,

246
0:14:08.280 --> 0:14:10.560
but it's a simple interface without needing

247
0:14:10.560 --> 0:14:12.400
to understand something.

248
0:14:12.400 --> 0:14:14.600
So I think it's very interesting for that,

249
0:14:14.600 --> 0:14:17.240
because it's a good point of beginning.

250
0:14:17.240 --> 0:14:21.720
And especially what I like in the package description tools

251
0:14:21.720 --> 0:14:23.960
is that it's very short.

252
0:14:23.960 --> 0:14:27.440
At least you take some packages, such as LaTeX,

253
0:14:27.440 --> 0:14:29.480
or of course LaTeX, when you start

254
0:14:29.480 --> 0:14:32.840
translating the description of LaTeX packages,

255
0:14:32.840 --> 0:14:34.200
it's less fun.

256
0:14:34.200 --> 0:14:39.480
At least sometimes 2,000 lines for a description.

257
0:14:39.480 --> 0:14:41.000
Somewhat difficult.

258
0:14:41.000 --> 0:14:45.400
But if you translate some more typical packages,

259
0:14:45.400 --> 0:14:46.440
it may be very short.

260
0:14:46.440 --> 0:14:49.000
And you can do one package a day, for example.

261
0:14:49.000 --> 0:14:51.240
So you can do really a true rhythm,

262
0:14:51.240 --> 0:14:54.800
to learn a true rhythm, and not, well,

263
0:14:54.800 --> 0:14:57.400
with a minimum follow up also.

264
0:14:57.400 --> 0:15:02.040
So I think it's a first step, which is very interesting.

265
0:15:02.040 --> 0:15:05.040
The next step could be the depth call screens

266
0:15:05.040 --> 0:15:07.720
on your way, or the newcomer.

267
0:15:07.720 --> 0:15:09.800
So depth call screens is other thing,

268
0:15:09.800 --> 0:15:13.720
because now you'll have to pass your translations, proposals

269
0:15:13.720 --> 0:15:16.960
on the mailing list, and to go in the process.

270
0:15:16.960 --> 0:15:19.320
So to understand the virtual address

271
0:15:19.320 --> 0:15:22.160
that we made in the topic, on the subject of the message,

272
0:15:22.160 --> 0:15:25.120
to be sure that the robot is able to understand

273
0:15:25.120 --> 0:15:27.280
what you're doing, and to report that

274
0:15:27.280 --> 0:15:31.120
in the tracking stats, in the tracking tables.

275
0:15:31.120 --> 0:15:33.760
So it's a bit more difficult. But well, you

276
0:15:33.760 --> 0:15:36.160
start having an experience of the Debian ecosystem.

277
0:15:36.160 --> 0:15:38.360
So we can consider that maybe you're

278
0:15:38.360 --> 0:15:40.360
ready to understand that.

279
0:15:40.360 --> 0:15:42.920
Maybe you will meet someone physically.

280
0:15:42.920 --> 0:15:45.720
We will explain to you how things work.

281
0:15:45.720 --> 0:15:50.320
And well, depth call, OK, you are going to now,

282
0:15:50.320 --> 0:15:53.360
intend to translate, request for review,

283
0:15:53.360 --> 0:15:56.760
last chance for a contributor for review.

284
0:15:56.760 --> 0:16:00.120
So you are going to really come in the process,

285
0:16:00.120 --> 0:16:04.440
to come in the Debian process, and to start contributing

286
0:16:04.440 --> 0:16:07.760
to really important things also.

287
0:16:07.760 --> 0:16:10.240
And it's the first responsibility

288
0:16:10.240 --> 0:16:13.480
in the process of Debian with the main working, et cetera,

289
0:16:13.480 --> 0:16:16.120
et cetera.

290
0:16:16.120 --> 0:16:18.960
And once you are completely comfortable with that,

291
0:16:18.960 --> 0:16:23.920
so the process is also here with coordination of the packages,

292
0:16:23.920 --> 0:16:27.840
with the messages which mentioned their status.

293
0:16:27.840 --> 0:16:30.000
And once the mail is received, of course,

294
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:32.080
you can translate your things.

295
0:16:32.080 --> 0:16:35.720
You translate your profiles with your own editor.

296
0:16:35.720 --> 0:16:36.880
Why not on WebLates?

297
0:16:36.880 --> 0:16:39.320
Because I saw that WebLates can become

298
0:16:39.320 --> 0:16:43.800
a dictionary of translations while using its own editor.

299
0:16:43.800 --> 0:16:44.880
You test the results.

300
0:16:44.880 --> 0:16:46.400
You also can do that.

301
0:16:46.400 --> 0:16:50.520
You report when you finished and when the team is

302
0:16:50.520 --> 0:16:52.120
OK with your translation.

303
0:16:52.120 --> 0:16:57.080
You report a bug to upstream, to the package maintainer,

304
0:16:57.080 --> 0:17:02.520
and it puts the profile in the package.

305
0:17:02.520 --> 0:17:04.800
And the benefits of that is your user

306
0:17:04.800 --> 0:17:09.360
preferred text editor, as I said, or also your PO editor.

307
0:17:09.360 --> 0:17:12.160
PO editor localized are some editors, some KDE,

308
0:17:12.160 --> 0:17:15.520
which work very much for that, to identify, in particular,

309
0:17:15.520 --> 0:17:21.320
the fuzzy strings or the untranslated strings.

310
0:17:21.320 --> 0:17:23.960
Because I forgot to precise some important things also,

311
0:17:23.960 --> 0:17:28.120
is that if we should use some WebLates interface,

312
0:17:28.120 --> 0:17:30.040
some things like that, there is another problem

313
0:17:30.040 --> 0:17:34.080
for some contributors like me is the accessibility problems.

314
0:17:34.080 --> 0:17:37.960
So it would prevent persons to contribute

315
0:17:37.960 --> 0:17:40.120
due to accessibility problems.

316
0:17:40.120 --> 0:17:43.280
With this method, unlike you can use some users.

317
0:17:43.280 --> 0:17:44.600
Personally, I use Emacs.

318
0:17:44.600 --> 0:17:46.360
We get texts.

319
0:17:46.360 --> 0:17:49.160
It's easy because it's in text, and there are not

320
0:17:49.160 --> 0:17:50.760
problems related to accessibility.

321
0:17:54.280 --> 0:17:57.280
Well, once you are comfortable with that,

322
0:17:57.280 --> 0:18:00.080
maybe you want to contribute to the effort of the Debian

323
0:18:00.080 --> 0:18:02.880
community to contribute to main pages.

324
0:18:02.880 --> 0:18:07.360
My pages is a big project, 2,000 pages, about,

325
0:18:07.360 --> 0:18:10.280
and a lot of updates.

326
0:18:10.280 --> 0:18:11.840
So it's a big project.

327
0:18:11.840 --> 0:18:14.600
But the good thing is the method is the same.

328
0:18:14.600 --> 0:18:17.760
So you close the gates, you translate the profiles,

329
0:18:17.760 --> 0:18:20.520
you are on the mailing list with the topics,

330
0:18:20.520 --> 0:18:24.480
the virtual topics to follow the process.

331
0:18:24.480 --> 0:18:26.960
And when it's finished, you commit,

332
0:18:26.960 --> 0:18:30.960
or you make someone in the team to commit.

333
0:18:30.960 --> 0:18:32.160
So you know the process.

334
0:18:32.160 --> 0:18:33.240
You know how it works.

335
0:18:33.240 --> 0:18:35.160
You know the conventions in Debian.

336
0:18:35.160 --> 0:18:36.880
So now you are able to contribute

337
0:18:36.880 --> 0:18:40.720
to any project based on PO files,

338
0:18:40.720 --> 0:18:44.760
even if it's not some packages themselves,

339
0:18:44.760 --> 0:18:47.880
but you can do main pages, you can do package description,

340
0:18:47.880 --> 0:18:50.320
you can do Debian packages themselves.

341
0:18:50.320 --> 0:18:52.440
So it becomes for you easy to contribute

342
0:18:52.440 --> 0:18:54.200
because you understand the process,

343
0:18:54.200 --> 0:18:59.400
and also the human beings in the community.

344
0:18:59.400 --> 0:19:03.160
Well, the benefits of the main pages

345
0:19:03.160 --> 0:19:08.880
is that that, well, just translate and discuss.

346
0:19:08.880 --> 0:19:11.560
You don't have any maintenance to do because German team does

347
0:19:11.560 --> 0:19:14.680
that and does that very good.

348
0:19:14.680 --> 0:19:19.480
So it's a very new area which is accessible for everybody

349
0:19:19.480 --> 0:19:23.760
and which is very cool to use.

350
0:19:23.760 --> 0:19:26.000
The next step is to keep recognizing.

351
0:19:26.000 --> 0:19:27.800
And it's useful for the community, of course,

352
0:19:27.800 --> 0:19:32.000
because as you know, main pages, Debian translates that,

353
0:19:32.000 --> 0:19:34.600
but we don't translate only for Debian.

354
0:19:34.600 --> 0:19:36.240
We translate for all the communities

355
0:19:36.240 --> 0:19:39.920
because main pages are used in all the distributions.

356
0:19:39.920 --> 0:19:44.320
So also, this translation is a way for you

357
0:19:44.320 --> 0:19:48.560
to contribute for all the community.

358
0:19:48.560 --> 0:19:52.680
Then you have documentation, the Debian specific documentation.

359
0:19:52.680 --> 0:19:55.680
So related to the Debian software,

360
0:19:55.680 --> 0:19:57.360
we have the release notes, of course.

361
0:19:57.360 --> 0:20:00.240
We have the Debian developers reference, et cetera,

362
0:20:00.240 --> 0:20:00.960
et cetera.

363
0:20:00.960 --> 0:20:03.480
But also, now it's only profiles.

364
0:20:03.480 --> 0:20:05.800
So it's not so difficult to understand

365
0:20:05.800 --> 0:20:08.760
how it works and the process to have a review

366
0:20:08.760 --> 0:20:11.720
and to have a quality assurance by the community

367
0:20:11.720 --> 0:20:14.200
of the translators.

368
0:20:14.200 --> 0:20:19.080
And packages, same thing in interaction with the community.

369
0:20:19.080 --> 0:20:22.760
We can also now translate all the things.

370
0:20:22.760 --> 0:20:25.320
According to your time, you will choose one of these projects

371
0:20:25.320 --> 0:20:30.160
or just translate for one, two, three, or all those projects

372
0:20:30.160 --> 0:20:33.560
according to the time and the energy you have.

373
0:20:33.560 --> 0:20:41.560
The analysis also, of course, it starts being a bit different,

374
0:20:41.560 --> 0:20:46.480
just like the website, because you will start to play with HTML.

375
0:20:46.480 --> 0:20:48.200
So it starts to being different.

376
0:20:48.200 --> 0:20:49.960
It's a new area.

377
0:20:49.960 --> 0:20:52.760
And I think starting with package descriptions

378
0:20:52.760 --> 0:20:57.240
avoids any difficulty from a technical point of view.

379
0:20:57.240 --> 0:21:00.240
Then, PO-FISE, it starts making you

380
0:21:00.240 --> 0:21:02.800
in front of the difficulty of the process.

381
0:21:02.800 --> 0:21:05.080
But, well, OK, the process is done.

382
0:21:05.080 --> 0:21:08.680
And to finish, you come to HTML pages,

383
0:21:08.680 --> 0:21:13.920
where it may seem, for some people, somewhat difficult.

384
0:21:13.920 --> 0:21:18.480
Because, well, you have to address tags and many things

385
0:21:18.480 --> 0:21:20.560
that you have on the HTML page.

386
0:21:20.560 --> 0:21:23.160
So it may be somewhat difficult.

387
0:21:23.160 --> 0:21:25.440
And however, it's important, because on the website,

388
0:21:25.440 --> 0:21:28.680
we have the security analysis, we have the publicity,

389
0:21:28.680 --> 0:21:32.560
we have all the platform for the Debian project leader.

390
0:21:32.560 --> 0:21:35.760
So it may become important.

391
0:21:35.760 --> 0:21:39.800
And for any of these steps, you can, of course, take the time.

392
0:21:39.800 --> 0:21:42.680
For example, it would take three years to package descriptions

393
0:21:42.680 --> 0:21:46.720
and then wait still three years for main pages, et cetera,

394
0:21:46.720 --> 0:21:49.360
according to your rhythm and your energy.

395
0:21:49.360 --> 0:21:56.120
And especially, you can do what you want, review or translating.

396
0:21:56.120 --> 0:21:58.280
Generally, when arriving, we suggest

397
0:21:58.280 --> 0:22:01.000
to review, to understand the conventions,

398
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:05.240
to understand the things, and to not take some time in your life.

399
0:22:05.240 --> 0:22:07.560
Then if you want to contribute to translating directly,

400
0:22:07.560 --> 0:22:09.040
it's a good idea.

401
0:22:09.040 --> 0:22:15.720
What I mean here is that we can do really at the, well,

402
0:22:15.720 --> 0:22:18.920
with the ways, with minimum ways and minimum installations,

403
0:22:18.920 --> 0:22:20.920
and the minimum understanding things,

404
0:22:20.920 --> 0:22:24.880
and especially on the progressive ways.

405
0:22:24.880 --> 0:22:28.000
Also, you can track in translations.

406
0:22:28.000 --> 0:22:29.880
So you subscribe to the mailing list,

407
0:22:29.880 --> 0:22:31.360
and you have a look at translations,

408
0:22:31.360 --> 0:22:34.640
and you follow what happens in matter of review,

409
0:22:34.640 --> 0:22:36.360
and in matter of translating new,

410
0:22:36.360 --> 0:22:40.280
if you consider that it's simple or short enough

411
0:22:40.280 --> 0:22:43.520
to make you spend the time to do it.

412
0:22:43.520 --> 0:22:46.160
So review and translating are the two steps

413
0:22:46.160 --> 0:22:50.600
you can do at any time in the process,

414
0:22:50.600 --> 0:22:53.040
and in your way on Debian.

415
0:22:53.040 --> 0:22:58.560
So to conclude, I would say that it's not an automated process,

416
0:22:58.560 --> 0:23:00.680
because we don't have the capability to do that.

417
0:23:00.680 --> 0:23:02.600
And I think the project is too complex today

418
0:23:02.600 --> 0:23:07.160
to do that efficiently, and it would imply some engineering

419
0:23:07.160 --> 0:23:09.360
to do things properly.

420
0:23:09.360 --> 0:23:15.080
But we have today some way, I think.

421
0:23:15.080 --> 0:23:17.960
And it's what I tried to suggest on the Wiki pages

422
0:23:17.960 --> 0:23:20.240
about translation and how to contribute

423
0:23:20.240 --> 0:23:24.120
and to start contributing and not being discouraged.

424
0:23:24.120 --> 0:23:27.720
I could have been during some years.

425
0:23:27.720 --> 0:23:32.880
There is a way from the most obvious, technically speaking,

426
0:23:32.880 --> 0:23:37.440
to less obvious with a contact with the community, which

427
0:23:37.440 --> 0:23:38.880
is progressive.

428
0:23:38.880 --> 0:23:42.160
And you discover how things work, the conventions,

429
0:23:42.160 --> 0:23:43.600
of course.

430
0:23:43.600 --> 0:23:47.800
The team discovers also if you are ready to respect

431
0:23:47.800 --> 0:23:51.560
how the team works, because we had some contributors where

432
0:23:51.560 --> 0:23:53.880
we've used it was complicated because he decided

433
0:23:53.880 --> 0:23:55.240
to do things like he wanted.

434
0:23:55.240 --> 0:23:57.640
Yes, but there is a team history.

435
0:23:57.640 --> 0:24:01.960
So you can do things like you want, as you want.

436
0:24:01.960 --> 0:24:04.200
Even if you're right, take the time and respect

437
0:24:04.200 --> 0:24:06.480
what other people do.

438
0:24:06.480 --> 0:24:12.040
And also, it's important to say that on the mailing list,

439
0:24:12.040 --> 0:24:16.120
also, if you start contributing via the mailing list,

440
0:24:16.120 --> 0:24:19.240
you have the chance to get your native language.

441
0:24:19.240 --> 0:24:23.160
Because in the French mailing list, but also in Italian,

442
0:24:23.160 --> 0:24:25.720
in Spanish, or any language, you have,

443
0:24:25.720 --> 0:24:27.360
for the translation teams, of course,

444
0:24:27.360 --> 0:24:29.880
people speaking your native language.

445
0:24:29.880 --> 0:24:33.800
So for example, now how to translate this English term

446
0:24:33.800 --> 0:24:37.440
in the language, it may be useful.

447
0:24:37.440 --> 0:24:39.920
And for example, in the package description,

448
0:24:39.920 --> 0:24:43.240
we also have a glossary to help people to know,

449
0:24:43.240 --> 0:24:46.600
OK, this English word which has a strange translation,

450
0:24:46.600 --> 0:24:47.760
should I translate?

451
0:24:47.760 --> 0:24:51.040
Or if I shouldn't translate, what should I do with that?

452
0:24:51.040 --> 0:24:54.760
And if I should translate, what kind of words is used usually?

453
0:24:54.760 --> 0:24:57.280
And once you do that, you can learn.

454
0:24:57.280 --> 0:25:00.320
And also, without any complicated tools

455
0:25:00.320 --> 0:25:04.520
or with no difficulties, you can start translating.

456
0:25:04.520 --> 0:25:07.280
And so you can become a Debian translator.

457
0:25:07.280 --> 0:25:12.280
Thanks.

458
0:25:12.280 --> 0:25:14.280
Oops.

459
0:25:14.280 --> 0:25:20.920
You've seen some feedback on some questions?

460
0:25:24.680 --> 0:25:28.400
For me, I can have feedback and global feedback

461
0:25:28.400 --> 0:25:30.760
on kind of all the things feedback.

462
0:25:30.760 --> 0:25:33.800
Because I have seen that maybe there

463
0:25:33.800 --> 0:25:36.880
is a fragmentation in different distribution.

464
0:25:36.880 --> 0:25:40.400
In Linux, and some have advantage,

465
0:25:40.400 --> 0:25:44.200
and the other not of this website.

466
0:25:44.200 --> 0:25:50.360
And so because I have never found a distribution that

467
0:25:50.360 --> 0:25:53.200
convinced me perfectly.

468
0:25:53.200 --> 0:25:57.040
For instance, for me, you have problem with vision.

469
0:25:57.040 --> 0:26:01.200
But for me, I have little problem with vision and granary.

470
0:26:01.200 --> 0:26:03.680
And so I should appreciate scrolling

471
0:26:03.680 --> 0:26:09.200
bar with a great and large line, a bit

472
0:26:09.200 --> 0:26:13.560
to go to adjust some problems.

473
0:26:13.560 --> 0:26:15.480
I doubt it's my MX Linux.

474
0:26:15.480 --> 0:26:18.760
They have a good scrolling bar, but also problems.

475
0:26:18.760 --> 0:26:26.480
So it's a kind I'd like to wish more cooperation

476
0:26:26.480 --> 0:26:29.840
with Linux as a problem of system day also,

477
0:26:29.840 --> 0:26:33.160
about something that I think is important

478
0:26:33.160 --> 0:26:42.600
for Linux community in general to have a better cooperation

479
0:26:42.600 --> 0:26:46.440
with different projects of distribution.

480
0:26:46.440 --> 0:26:49.120
I think that the importance is free software,

481
0:26:49.120 --> 0:26:51.160
even if what you say is right.

482
0:26:51.160 --> 0:26:53.600
I'm OK with that.

483
0:26:53.600 --> 0:26:56.760
According to my understanding of things and about translation,

484
0:26:56.760 --> 0:26:58.400
it's right also.

485
0:26:58.400 --> 0:27:02.480
Is that the user find a way for himself?

486
0:27:02.480 --> 0:27:05.440
I mean, that's OK.

487
0:27:05.440 --> 0:27:07.800
Debian has his way of work.

488
0:27:07.800 --> 0:27:09.280
Ubuntu has his way of work.

489
0:27:09.280 --> 0:27:12.400
And any project has his way of work according to the history,

490
0:27:12.400 --> 0:27:15.160
according to what it needs to be doing, et cetera.

491
0:27:15.160 --> 0:27:19.240
Well, the thing is how to enable a user

492
0:27:19.240 --> 0:27:23.440
to find among all the existing ways a way for him.

493
0:27:23.440 --> 0:27:26.240
And I think it's right for any new users,

494
0:27:26.240 --> 0:27:27.800
that's exactly what you're saying,

495
0:27:27.800 --> 0:27:30.720
but also it's right for new contributors.

496
0:27:30.720 --> 0:27:34.440
Because contributing may work according to some rules,

497
0:27:34.440 --> 0:27:38.360
some community interaction, some tools, of course.

498
0:27:38.360 --> 0:27:41.280
So it's not a kind of what is better, what is not better.

499
0:27:41.280 --> 0:27:45.400
It's only a kind of is it sweet for you, actually.

500
0:27:45.400 --> 0:27:47.480
And in the community, the benefit

501
0:27:47.480 --> 0:27:50.160
is that you have this diversity which

502
0:27:50.160 --> 0:27:52.520
enables you to decide what is good for you

503
0:27:52.520 --> 0:27:55.840
and what is good for your way of doing things.

504
0:27:55.840 --> 0:27:56.880
So it's a good thing.

505
0:27:56.880 --> 0:27:58.320
But yes, there are a lot of ways.

506
0:27:58.320 --> 0:28:01.240
And to find the way it's good for you is not easy.

507
0:28:06.840 --> 0:28:11.840
I think the De Leung community has something very good

508
0:28:11.840 --> 0:28:14.840
on which we should all learn to do

509
0:28:14.840 --> 0:28:18.320
is you have a very good translation workflow.

510
0:28:18.320 --> 0:28:20.800
And I think this is something valuable.

511
0:28:20.800 --> 0:28:24.800
And this is the reason why you are able to continue

512
0:28:24.800 --> 0:28:28.800
doing some email translation.

513
0:28:28.800 --> 0:28:35.800
Still, even if the world is using much different workflow,

514
0:28:35.800 --> 0:28:40.280
I think that's your bigger value in this.

515
0:28:40.280 --> 0:28:44.480
And my question would be, what are the limitations

516
0:28:44.480 --> 0:28:49.280
that you see in the existing translation platform

517
0:28:49.280 --> 0:28:53.800
in terms of accessibility for you who are blind,

518
0:28:53.800 --> 0:28:58.440
but also in terms of way to collaborate as a team?

519
0:28:58.440 --> 0:29:03.640
Because I did push forward late in many places.

520
0:29:03.640 --> 0:29:04.800
It helps a lot.

521
0:29:04.800 --> 0:29:07.560
But it doesn't create any miracle.

522
0:29:07.560 --> 0:29:10.960
The community needs to find a way

523
0:29:10.960 --> 0:29:14.040
to define the workflow, the way to collaborate together.

524
0:29:14.040 --> 0:29:16.920
And this is something that the rest of the resource community

525
0:29:16.920 --> 0:29:19.240
can learn from the De Leung community.

526
0:29:19.240 --> 0:29:21.400
Your tools are a little bit prehistoric.

527
0:29:21.400 --> 0:29:24.920
But your own way of working are very clear and easy

528
0:29:24.920 --> 0:29:26.400
to understand.

529
0:29:26.400 --> 0:29:28.840
And I would be interesting to have your feedback

530
0:29:28.840 --> 0:29:31.800
on translation platform in terms of accessibility.

531
0:29:31.800 --> 0:29:36.800
And what are lucky to have a proper collaboration

532
0:29:36.800 --> 0:29:40.400
as a team in what we have today?

533
0:29:40.400 --> 0:29:41.120
Thanks.

534
0:29:41.120 --> 0:29:45.040
Because you sum up what I want to show here.

535
0:29:45.040 --> 0:29:48.400
What you say is exactly what I think and I want to show.

536
0:29:48.400 --> 0:29:51.920
But I know, and I'm aware from some feedbacks I can have.

537
0:29:51.920 --> 0:29:56.680
And because I know there is a low stream of new,

538
0:29:56.680 --> 0:30:00.040
a low flow of new contributors, maybe,

539
0:30:00.040 --> 0:30:02.600
and I say maybe because I'm not sure myself about that.

540
0:30:02.600 --> 0:30:07.040
Because for me, indeed, what the tools we are using now

541
0:30:07.040 --> 0:30:10.000
are perfect because they are accessible, because they work,

542
0:30:10.000 --> 0:30:12.160
and because they are able to have a record

543
0:30:12.160 --> 0:30:14.160
and to have a team collaboration.

544
0:30:14.160 --> 0:30:17.560
So for me, these tools are really perfect.

545
0:30:17.560 --> 0:30:20.760
But in the new generation of new contributors,

546
0:30:20.760 --> 0:30:25.840
I know that indeed there are some more friendly interfaces,

547
0:30:25.840 --> 0:30:32.440
some more design, some ways to do a UI and UX, which

548
0:30:32.440 --> 0:30:35.880
is more beautiful and more friendly, more attractive,

549
0:30:35.880 --> 0:30:39.080
also, or you have less learning curve.

550
0:30:39.080 --> 0:30:41.880
So you can come in the project, do something,

551
0:30:41.880 --> 0:30:43.160
opt to leave, no problem.

552
0:30:43.160 --> 0:30:45.560
You don't have to learn during some months, something,

553
0:30:45.560 --> 0:30:46.400
et cetera, et cetera.

554
0:30:46.400 --> 0:30:50.200
So also, the problem today, the new contributors

555
0:30:50.200 --> 0:30:54.680
in our society is that people don't want less,

556
0:30:54.680 --> 0:30:56.840
want to get involved in the long term.

557
0:30:56.840 --> 0:30:59.040
They want to come, to try something, give it a try,

558
0:30:59.040 --> 0:31:01.400
opt and to leave, because, well, we have our lives,

559
0:31:01.400 --> 0:31:03.160
we have our obligations, et cetera.

560
0:31:03.160 --> 0:31:04.240
And that's right in Debian.

561
0:31:04.240 --> 0:31:06.520
It's something more difficult. Because in libraries,

562
0:31:06.520 --> 0:31:08.880
for example, you can go, OK, you have an error,

563
0:31:08.880 --> 0:31:11.680
or a mistake on the string, you open the relates, opt,

564
0:31:11.680 --> 0:31:13.960
you fix the string, opt and you leave away.

565
0:31:13.960 --> 0:31:14.840
And perfect.

566
0:31:14.840 --> 0:31:16.880
Well, in Debian, it's not possible.

567
0:31:16.880 --> 0:31:19.120
Well, it's possible for the package description,

568
0:31:19.120 --> 0:31:20.320
because it's a web interface.

569
0:31:20.320 --> 0:31:21.560
There is not a learning curve.

570
0:31:21.560 --> 0:31:22.600
It's very simple.

571
0:31:22.600 --> 0:31:26.160
But for people who don't want to do the effort to learn,

572
0:31:26.160 --> 0:31:30.120
we don't want to do the efforts of understanding deeply things,

573
0:31:30.120 --> 0:31:32.120
well, it may be destructive.

574
0:31:32.120 --> 0:31:33.560
Is it bad news?

575
0:31:33.560 --> 0:31:34.160
I don't know.

576
0:31:34.160 --> 0:31:35.120
I'm not sure.

577
0:31:35.120 --> 0:31:37.040
But the fact is that the team is small.

578
0:31:37.040 --> 0:31:39.240
And the fact is that we have no few contributors.

579
0:31:39.240 --> 0:31:41.680
So I wonder if it's a limitation.

580
0:31:41.680 --> 0:31:45.200
But for contributors who try to be forced to do that,

581
0:31:45.200 --> 0:31:48.760
I think these truths are indeed really perfect.

582
0:31:52.480 --> 0:31:56.120
Yeah, just one more question for the mute finish.

583
0:31:56.120 --> 0:32:00.160
So you've started a process to create new translations.

584
0:32:00.160 --> 0:32:03.200
Can you give some examples how you

585
0:32:03.200 --> 0:32:06.000
want to try in recipes to update existing translations,

586
0:32:06.000 --> 0:32:08.960
like the original text changes, the English text changes?

587
0:32:08.960 --> 0:32:10.400
How do you know about this?

588
0:32:10.400 --> 0:32:13.880
Do you notify the same translator as before?

589
0:32:13.880 --> 0:32:15.840
Can everybody jump in and think that?

590
0:32:18.440 --> 0:32:22.000
Do you think that the product will

591
0:32:22.000 --> 0:32:12.300
be possible in the

592
0:32:22.300 --> 0:32:26.280
process of not watching the web?

593
0:32:26.280 --> 0:32:29.560
Actually, for example, to take the depth

594
0:32:29.560 --> 0:32:31.840
core for the main pages, for example,

595
0:32:31.840 --> 0:32:35.880
when there is an update, the translator has a warning.

596
0:32:35.880 --> 0:32:38.120
He knows that he has something, which

597
0:32:38.120 --> 0:32:41.240
is because the translator is considered as the last one who

598
0:32:41.240 --> 0:32:45.160
can do the changes or should do the changes.

599
0:32:45.160 --> 0:32:48.720
Once he has this warning, either via mail

600
0:32:48.720 --> 0:32:52.560
or because he has a look on the statistics page,

601
0:32:52.560 --> 0:32:55.320
he says, OK, so I will do that.

602
0:32:55.320 --> 0:32:58.760
So he sends a mail with an address saying that, OK,

603
0:32:58.760 --> 0:33:03.840
this page, this description, this profile, I will translate it.

604
0:33:03.840 --> 0:33:05.120
So there is a mail.

605
0:33:05.120 --> 0:33:07.160
And the community has the information,

606
0:33:07.160 --> 0:33:10.680
is notified that the person is going to translate.

607
0:33:10.680 --> 0:33:13.080
After it, it will translate the profile,

608
0:33:13.080 --> 0:33:15.440
or the file in it.

609
0:33:15.440 --> 0:33:18.600
And then, OK, now I finished.

610
0:33:18.600 --> 0:33:20.760
Thanks to review the translation.

611
0:33:20.760 --> 0:33:22.480
So there are some review.

612
0:33:22.480 --> 0:33:26.080
It's a process which can be five days or 10 days

613
0:33:26.080 --> 0:33:28.440
according to the number of mistakes

614
0:33:28.440 --> 0:33:31.080
which needs to be fixed, et cetera.

615
0:33:31.080 --> 0:33:35.360
And at the end, he says, OK, last chance for change.

616
0:33:35.360 --> 0:33:38.560
So OK, it's the last chance for you to review and to tell me

617
0:33:38.560 --> 0:33:40.120
if there is a problem.

618
0:33:40.120 --> 0:33:43.280
And once that's done, when the mail arrives on the community

619
0:33:43.280 --> 0:33:47.480
team, if there is not any reply, well, OK,

620
0:33:47.480 --> 0:33:50.360
the translator can either report a bug

621
0:33:50.360 --> 0:33:52.560
to say to the maintainer of the package, OK,

622
0:33:52.560 --> 0:33:53.760
there is a new translation.

623
0:33:53.760 --> 0:33:54.840
It's updates.

624
0:33:54.840 --> 0:33:57.040
Please put it in your package.

625
0:33:57.040 --> 0:34:01.280
Or he can do it himself or herself

626
0:34:01.280 --> 0:34:05.360
if the person has the permission to access to the git

627
0:34:05.360 --> 0:34:08.200
and the repository and to do the translation.

628
0:34:08.200 --> 0:34:09.760
So it's manual.

629
0:34:09.760 --> 0:34:12.160
But of course, there are some scripts to do that.

630
0:34:12.160 --> 0:34:14.200
You don't have to do that manually.

631
0:34:14.200 --> 0:34:15.560
It's not mandatory.

632
0:34:15.560 --> 0:34:17.880
But the process is really you have a follow up

633
0:34:17.880 --> 0:34:21.320
of the situation via mail.

634
0:34:21.320 --> 0:34:22.320
OK.

635
0:34:22.320 --> 0:34:23.000
Thank you, Jochen.

636
0:34:23.000 --> 0:34:23.520
Thanks.

637
0:34:23.520 --> 0:34:31.480
Thank you.
