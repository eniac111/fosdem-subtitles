0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.640
So, welcome to the first Haskell dev room at FOSDEM and thank you for coming.

2
0:00:12.640 --> 0:00:19.000
We have a great line-up of speakers today on a diverse range of topics and a bunch of

3
0:00:19.000 --> 0:00:25.160
the topics are really aimed at newcomers to Haskell or people who haven't been programming

4
0:00:25.160 --> 0:00:27.840
Haskell for very long.

5
0:00:27.840 --> 0:00:32.640
So please encourage people you know here at FOSDEM to come along.

6
0:00:32.640 --> 0:00:39.040
I believe that there is a live stream, there is a matrix chat room where you can put questions

7
0:00:39.040 --> 0:00:49.560
or discuss the topics and we're going to have a raffle at the end of the dev room.

8
0:00:49.560 --> 0:00:54.760
We will hand out raffle tickets to people who are new to Haskell.

9
0:00:54.760 --> 0:01:02.720
So the prizes, we have three copies of Graham Hartons programming in Haskell second edition

10
0:01:02.720 --> 0:01:08.480
and we have the booby prize, jar of vegemite from my native country.

11
0:01:08.480 --> 0:01:17.240
We have stickers up the front here, come and grab some stickers to adorn your laptops or

12
0:01:17.240 --> 0:01:19.960
books or whatever you like.

13
0:01:19.960 --> 0:01:20.960
How many do we have?

14
0:01:20.960 --> 0:01:21.960
Stickers?

15
0:01:21.960 --> 0:01:22.960
Yep.

16
0:01:22.960 --> 0:01:23.960
A lot.

17
0:01:23.960 --> 0:01:25.160
A lot of stickers.

18
0:01:25.160 --> 0:01:30.160
So feel free to take a handful if you want.

19
0:01:30.160 --> 0:01:34.240
The first talk will be in just a few minutes.

20
0:01:34.240 --> 0:01:38.160
So I will introduce the speaker in a couple of minutes.

21
0:01:38.160 --> 0:01:39.160
Thank you.

22
0:01:39.160 --> 0:01:55.620
There we go...
