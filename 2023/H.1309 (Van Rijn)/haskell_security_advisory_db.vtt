00:00.000 --> 00:09.960
Welcome back.

00:09.960 --> 00:13.840
Our next talk is from Fraser Twitwelt.

00:13.840 --> 00:19.360
He lives in Brisbane, Australia where he works in identity management and PKI at Red Hat.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.760
He's passionate about functional programming security and really likes playing with little

00:22.760 --> 00:27.000
plastic bricks from Denmark, a detail which he clearly included to pander to his co-organizer

00:27.000 --> 00:36.680
tools.

00:36.680 --> 00:43.840
Just a very quick talk giving an update about the Haskell Security Advisory Database.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.880
Why do we want one?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.160
Security matters a lot.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.520
It is very important.

00:52.520 --> 00:59.200
Security programming languages have been improving their security tooling and introducing vulnerability

00:59.200 --> 01:06.360
databases of their own, audit tools in the package management and build systems.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.760
We should follow suit.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.840
We should not just follow, we should try and lead in fact and have best in class security

01:13.840 --> 01:17.880
tooling for our best in class language.

01:17.880 --> 01:24.560
It's increasingly important for industry adoption that language ecosystems have a way of reporting

01:24.560 --> 01:29.920
security vulnerabilities and disseminating that information so that commercial users

01:29.920 --> 01:36.980
of the language or non-commercial users of the language can find out about security issues

01:36.980 --> 01:40.460
when they arise and respond to them.

01:40.460 --> 01:50.360
It's also needed for some industry certifications like ISO 27001 which is therefore also important

01:50.360 --> 01:54.560
for industry adoption.

01:54.560 --> 02:05.080
In August 2022 there was a tech proposal through the Haskell Foundation tech proposal procedures

02:05.080 --> 02:12.600
to establish a security advisory database and a team who would manage it.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.720
That proposal was refined and accepted.

02:16.720 --> 02:24.840
The database repository was created, bootstrapped if you will in November 2022 but as of now

02:24.840 --> 02:27.120
it's still empty.

02:27.120 --> 02:34.680
The next step is to assemble a security response team who will populate and manage that database.

02:34.680 --> 02:42.320
The call for nominations for the Haskell security response team will be going out in the next

02:42.320 --> 02:45.400
couple of days.

02:45.400 --> 02:52.960
The responsibilities of the security response team or SRT will be to triage and assess incoming

02:52.960 --> 03:03.080
security reports and for real vulnerabilities to move them into the database.

03:03.080 --> 03:10.480
We will update and maintain the advisory database and ensure that the data is in a form that

03:10.480 --> 03:14.120
is useful for downstream security tooling.

03:14.120 --> 03:19.720
These could be tools like Cabal install, we can implement an audit command to check whether

03:19.720 --> 03:25.840
your program or any of its dependencies have known security vulnerabilities.

03:25.840 --> 03:32.080
GitHub dependerbot is another tool on GitHub that can consume the data in the advisory

03:32.080 --> 03:39.440
database and automatically notify maintainers and project owners when there are security

03:39.440 --> 03:46.600
issues and potentially even do bumping of bounds and automatically creating pull requests

03:46.600 --> 03:54.600
and testing the projects in order to make life easier for maintainers to move when a

03:54.600 --> 03:59.000
security issue is found.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.440
Developing those tools is not the responsibility of the SRT but working with and liaising with

04:04.440 --> 04:09.400
the developers of those downstream tools is a responsibility.

04:09.400 --> 04:15.760
And there will be a quarterly report on the team's activities and on the trends in the

04:15.760 --> 04:18.760
reported security issues.

04:18.760 --> 04:25.240
So, who will be on the SRT?

04:25.240 --> 04:32.080
We're looking for five volunteers who can commit to an initial term of six or 12 months

04:32.080 --> 04:36.520
and in that way the terms will then be staggered.

04:36.520 --> 04:42.480
We're looking for people with experience in security topics such as, this is not an exhaustive

04:42.480 --> 04:50.360
list but topics like, secure development and web application security, pen testing, incident

04:50.360 --> 04:58.480
response and vulnerability research, cryptography, authentication, identity management, GRC,

04:58.480 --> 05:04.920
that's governance, risk and compliance and any other security related topics.

05:04.920 --> 05:11.600
Obviously no one has all of these but we're looking for people to bring different experience

05:11.600 --> 05:16.180
in these different topic areas so that we have a broad coverage within the security

05:16.180 --> 05:18.000
response team.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.480
So, as I mentioned the call for nominations will go out in the next day or so.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.880
We're looking for people to self nominate so if you know someone who you think would

05:26.880 --> 05:31.360
be great please encourage them to nominate themselves.

05:31.360 --> 05:38.640
The nomination process will be to email me on that address and say I want to do it and

05:38.640 --> 05:47.120
give a brief overview of your background in security and we will aim to announce the initial

05:47.120 --> 05:52.200
security response team around the end of February.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
And that's the update.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
Thanks for listening.

05:54.200 --> 06:19.620
ï¿½ Congratsverns.
