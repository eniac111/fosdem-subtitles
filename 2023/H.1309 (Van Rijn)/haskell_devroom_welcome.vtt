00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
So, welcome to the first Haskell dev room at FOSDEM and thank you for coming.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.000
We have a great line-up of speakers today on a diverse range of topics and a bunch of

00:19.000 --> 00:25.160
the topics are really aimed at newcomers to Haskell or people who haven't been programming

00:25.160 --> 00:27.840
Haskell for very long.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.640
So please encourage people you know here at FOSDEM to come along.

00:32.640 --> 00:39.040
I believe that there is a live stream, there is a matrix chat room where you can put questions

00:39.040 --> 00:49.560
or discuss the topics and we're going to have a raffle at the end of the dev room.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.760
We will hand out raffle tickets to people who are new to Haskell.

00:54.760 --> 01:02.720
So the prizes, we have three copies of Graham Hartons programming in Haskell second edition

01:02.720 --> 01:08.480
and we have the booby prize, jar of vegemite from my native country.

01:08.480 --> 01:17.240
We have stickers up the front here, come and grab some stickers to adorn your laptops or

01:17.240 --> 01:19.960
books or whatever you like.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.960
How many do we have?

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
Stickers?

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
Yep.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
A lot.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.160
A lot of stickers.

01:25.160 --> 01:30.160
So feel free to take a handful if you want.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.240
The first talk will be in just a few minutes.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.160
So I will introduce the speaker in a couple of minutes.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.160
Thank you.

01:39.160 --> 01:55.620
There we go...
