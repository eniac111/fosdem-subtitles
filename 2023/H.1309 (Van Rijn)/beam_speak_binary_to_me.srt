1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:16.400
Okay. Now we have Trolls Brozgad and he's going to speak to us of Biner pattern matching and

2
0:00:16.400 --> 0:00:21.360
Elixir and Erlang, one of the cool features of Erlang and Elixir. So, do you speak binary

3
0:00:21.360 --> 0:00:33.280
to me? Give it up for Trolls. Thank you. Don't worry, I'm not going to speak binary, but

4
0:00:33.280 --> 0:00:38.840
yes, this is talk about speaking binary to other devices. And this is me and you can

5
0:00:38.840 --> 0:00:50.520
find me around the web at TRARBR. Yes. I work as a software developer in Denmark and a company

6
0:00:50.520 --> 0:00:57.600
called IndieLab and part of my job is to work on innovations in the Internet of Things realm.

7
0:00:57.600 --> 0:01:05.120
So things like smart buildings, smart cities and smart factories. In practice, this involves

8
0:01:05.120 --> 0:01:10.360
building gateways that link many different kinds of stupid things together and then when

9
0:01:10.360 --> 0:01:15.520
we have a network of things, we can exchange information and we can embed the smartest

10
0:01:15.520 --> 0:01:21.440
into the system. And by many different stupid things, things like remote terminal units,

11
0:01:21.440 --> 0:01:27.320
which are used in the grid, electric grid and other utilities, PLCs, which are used heavily

12
0:01:27.320 --> 0:01:34.280
in factories for automation, solar inverters, heat pumps, thermostats, all kinds of smart

13
0:01:34.280 --> 0:01:42.000
home equipment and at the lowest level we have simple sensors and actuators. And the

14
0:01:42.000 --> 0:01:47.680
thing that all these things have in common is that we had to speak binary to them. They

15
0:01:47.680 --> 0:01:54.040
don't speak JSON, they don't know XML, they don't know protocol even. They had their own

16
0:01:54.040 --> 0:02:01.560
custom binary dialects depending on the protocol that they are using. And later in this talk

17
0:02:01.560 --> 0:02:09.240
I'll show an example of a simple binary dialect so that we all know what that is. When I'm

18
0:02:09.240 --> 0:02:14.040
building an integration for a system like this, I always read for Alexa first. This

19
0:02:14.040 --> 0:02:18.160
is because Alexa has a special authority system that makes it extremely good at this kind

20
0:02:18.160 --> 0:02:26.240
of work. This is also the case for Erlang and LFE and Beam and Gleam and the other languages

21
0:02:26.240 --> 0:02:33.040
on the Erlang virtual machine, but Alexa happens to be my happy space. Some of the Beam's

22
0:02:33.040 --> 0:02:39.480
known strong points in this area are fault tolerance, state machines and concurrency.

23
0:02:39.480 --> 0:02:44.520
And then there's bits and text. That's what I'll be talking about today. This is a beginner

24
0:02:44.520 --> 0:02:50.680
level talk. I don't assume you know anything about Alexa or the previously mentioned systems.

25
0:02:50.680 --> 0:02:54.120
But my hope is that if you should find yourself in a situation where you need to speak binary

26
0:02:54.120 --> 0:02:59.240
to something, this talk will help you get started.

27
0:02:59.240 --> 0:03:07.600
So binaries. Computers today work by manipulating electric signals. And a signal can be either

28
0:03:07.600 --> 0:03:12.920
a logic high or a logic low. Such a signal is known as a bit. And a sequence of eight

29
0:03:12.920 --> 0:03:19.480
bits is a byte. And this is also how computers communicate. No matter if it's ethernet or

30
0:03:19.480 --> 0:03:27.800
Wi-Fi or whatever, it's about transferring a logic signal of high and low bits. And there

31
0:03:27.800 --> 0:03:35.040
are different ways we can write down the sort of binary signals. The first notation that

32
0:03:35.040 --> 0:03:41.960
I highlighted here isn't binary, where we just take every bit in the sequence and we

33
0:03:41.960 --> 0:03:47.560
write it down as a zero or a one. And then it prefixes it with a zero or a B so that

34
0:03:47.560 --> 0:03:55.360
it's easier to tell from other numbers. And in this case, the sequence of eight bits,

35
0:03:55.360 --> 0:04:03.480
which is a byte, can also be turned into a decimal number. Because in a byte we can have

36
0:04:03.480 --> 0:04:12.360
256 different combinations. So it's a number from zero to 255. And in decimal notation,

37
0:04:12.360 --> 0:04:22.440
this sequence of bits is 75. There's also a hex notation where we use the characters

38
0:04:22.440 --> 0:04:29.240
zero to nine and A to F. This means we can have described the concept of a byte with

39
0:04:29.240 --> 0:04:37.800
just two characters. So this is very convenient when we are dealing with binary numbers. Just

40
0:04:37.800 --> 0:04:43.960
a common example of where we write the bytes as decimals. We do that with IPv4 addresses.

41
0:04:43.960 --> 0:04:48.760
Because an IPv4 address is just four bytes. But then for human consumption, we write it

42
0:04:48.760 --> 0:04:57.800
as a binary number. Or sorry, a decimal number. And Mac addresses use a hex notation instead

43
0:04:57.800 --> 0:05:10.860
of the binary notation. While all the operations in our computers are processing bits and bytes,

44
0:05:10.860 --> 0:05:17.560
we rarely think about them when we are programming. We think in terms of integers, floats, strings,

45
0:05:17.560 --> 0:05:26.720
lists, maps, and other structures. But binary data is just a flat stream of bits. There's

46
0:05:26.720 --> 0:05:33.080
nothing inherent in it to tell one field from the other. Or any kind of structure. It's

47
0:05:33.080 --> 0:05:39.240
all down to how we interpret those bits. This means that when we need to speak binary to

48
0:05:39.240 --> 0:05:44.120
something from our programs, we need to write a translation layer that can take whatever

49
0:05:44.120 --> 0:05:53.560
list of maps we have in our program and turn it into a binary sequence. I prefer calling

50
0:05:53.560 --> 0:05:59.720
this translation layer a codec because it's short to write. And you can say that a codec

51
0:05:59.720 --> 0:06:07.880
encodes our data structures in bytes for sending. And then we receive data, the codec decodes

52
0:06:07.880 --> 0:06:16.200
that data into our higher level data structures. And sometimes we're lucky we can find a library

53
0:06:16.200 --> 0:06:20.920
that will do that for us. But sometimes we need to do it ourselves. And that's where

54
0:06:20.920 --> 0:06:30.440
bits and text comes in handy. So let's take a look at that. Let's say I need to send a

55
0:06:30.440 --> 0:06:38.920
sequence of three bytes to some other system. They need to have values 10, 20, and 30. To

56
0:06:38.920 --> 0:06:48.760
do that, I use distance X. So I use double-ankle brackets to start the binary sequence. And

57
0:06:48.760 --> 0:06:54.920
then I write the bytes that I need in sequence and separate it by a comma. So that's pretty

58
0:06:54.920 --> 0:07:05.000
simple. Yes. And when I need to receive that data, like if I'm receiving the same sequence

59
0:07:05.000 --> 0:07:12.280
of bytes, I need to decode that into three variables, A, B, and C. Then I use distance

60
0:07:12.280 --> 0:07:18.520
X, again, double brackets. Then I put the variables instead of the numbers that I want

61
0:07:18.520 --> 0:07:30.520
to extract. So it's pretty simple. But of course, we're not really done yet. There's

62
0:07:30.520 --> 0:07:37.800
very few domains where we only work with integers in the sequence of 0 to 255. We need larger

63
0:07:37.800 --> 0:07:44.840
numbers. We need negative numbers. We need loads and strings. But many languages will

64
0:07:44.840 --> 0:07:51.480
just give a byte stream. And then you need to sort of do a lot of strange computations

65
0:07:51.480 --> 0:07:59.080
to turn that into lists and strings. But in Elixir and on the Beam, we have the distance

66
0:07:59.080 --> 0:08:09.960
X and we can do more. Specifically, with distance X, we have the option or the ability to specify

67
0:08:09.960 --> 0:08:25.720
modifiers. And the modifiers can specify the type, the size, unit, and indianness of the

68
0:08:25.720 --> 0:08:34.560
sequence of bits we want to extract from the binary. So here you see that the type is integer.

69
0:08:34.560 --> 0:08:40.720
It's unsigned, so it's positive numbers only. It has a size of eight units. And one unit

70
0:08:40.720 --> 0:08:48.440
is said to be one bit long. And it's big indian, which I will talk about later. So these are

71
0:08:48.440 --> 0:08:57.960
all equivalent, 10, 20, 30. They're encoded the same way as just different syntaxes. So

72
0:08:57.960 --> 0:09:07.720
you can see if you don't specify any modifiers, these are the defaults that I used instead.

73
0:09:07.720 --> 0:09:14.120
And in the second line, I omitted size of just row eight. That's something you can do

74
0:09:14.120 --> 0:09:19.640
when you know it has a constant at compile time. If the size is variable, you will need

75
0:09:19.640 --> 0:09:27.320
to use the full size modifier. And the modifiers can be combined in any order. So you can do

76
0:09:27.320 --> 0:09:34.360
whatever you like. And when we decode it, we use exactly the same syntax. We can say

77
0:09:34.360 --> 0:09:40.560
the same things like grab the first byte, tell it to compile it as an integer, and then

78
0:09:40.560 --> 0:09:50.120
it will extract it like this. And instead of just going through all the different modifiers

79
0:09:50.120 --> 0:09:56.000
and the combinations, I move on to showcasing some examples. But before we do that, I want

80
0:09:56.000 --> 0:10:04.840
to mention where the bits and text came from. Bits and text comes from a place of pain.

81
0:10:04.840 --> 0:10:15.080
These two guys, Claire, we're working at the computer science laboratory on implementing

82
0:10:15.080 --> 0:10:25.920
networking protocols for Erlang. And it was painful. And so they sat down since they were

83
0:10:25.920 --> 0:10:33.520
so close to the makers of the language, they could invent a new syntax for use in Erlang.

84
0:10:33.520 --> 0:10:38.800
And this paper, which is published in 1998, describes the first version of the syntax

85
0:10:38.800 --> 0:10:45.600
as it was implemented in an experimental version of Erlang. I think a few months later it was

86
0:10:45.600 --> 0:10:56.040
released with a slightly different syntax, but with all the same concepts. And that paper

87
0:10:56.040 --> 0:11:03.520
also explains what Indianness is. And it's actually just a fun word for byte order. Because

88
0:11:03.520 --> 0:11:08.760
if you have a 16-bit integer that you need to send to some other system, that's two bytes,

89
0:11:08.760 --> 0:11:15.640
right? And you have to figure out the one byte is A2 and the other byte is C1. And you

90
0:11:15.640 --> 0:11:23.840
have to figure out which byte do you send first. Some systems will send the most significant

91
0:11:23.840 --> 0:11:32.480
byte first. So that's A2. But other systems will send the least significant byte first.

92
0:11:32.480 --> 0:11:40.640
That's C1. And so this obviously has consequences because you need to know the byte order that

93
0:11:40.640 --> 0:11:49.240
the system you're talking to, what it expects. Otherwise, you just get confused. And yes,

94
0:11:49.240 --> 0:11:54.120
the byte ordering is said to be big Indian when you start with the most significant byte

95
0:11:54.120 --> 0:11:58.640
and it's said to be little Indian if you start with the least significant byte. And this

96
0:11:58.640 --> 0:12:04.480
is kind of a thing. I've been working with this for years, but I didn't really know what

97
0:12:04.480 --> 0:12:11.000
Indian means because it's a sort of weird name, right? But the paper by class and Tony

98
0:12:11.000 --> 0:12:16.160
hinted me in the direction of finding that by pointing me to this Internet experiment

99
0:12:16.160 --> 0:12:23.040
note from 1980, which is I think the first sort of place where Indian and byte order

100
0:12:23.040 --> 0:12:31.440
was used together on holy wars of the plea for peace. And that sort of shows that this

101
0:12:31.440 --> 0:12:40.920
is an important topic, sort of like VIM versus HEMEX, I guess. And it's actually just Indian

102
0:12:40.920 --> 0:12:47.160
is just a pop culture reference to a book called Golovac Travels where a seagull travels

103
0:12:47.160 --> 0:12:53.400
out into the world and meets the people of the Lilliput and Blya Fusco, I think, and

104
0:12:53.400 --> 0:13:00.720
the armed conflict because the emperor of Lilliput has commanded that X must be broken

105
0:13:00.720 --> 0:13:07.720
at the little end when you eat them for breakfast or whatever. So that's obviously absurd and

106
0:13:07.720 --> 0:13:14.240
so they wait a war. So big Indian means we send the big end of the number first and the

107
0:13:14.240 --> 0:13:24.320
little Indian means we send a little end of the number. So examples of bits and texts.

108
0:13:24.320 --> 0:13:29.560
For the purpose of this talk, I have invented the T-box, which is very simple device. It

109
0:13:29.560 --> 0:13:34.600
has a name and it can measure the temperature and it can tell you if there's an error in

110
0:13:34.600 --> 0:13:43.240
the timestamp or the measurement. It has a binary dialect or protocol, which I also invented.

111
0:13:43.240 --> 0:13:46.560
And this sort of mirrors what you will find in a real protocol description for some kind

112
0:13:46.560 --> 0:13:56.960
of device. A client can connect to a T-box and can send requests to the T-box and the

113
0:13:56.960 --> 0:14:03.800
T-box will respond with a reply. Every message that is sent includes a header, which is one

114
0:14:03.800 --> 0:14:15.160
byte long and replies from the T-box will also contain a value. The header starts with

115
0:14:15.160 --> 0:14:22.080
four bits of magic, which is a constant value that is always there and is used to sort of

116
0:14:22.080 --> 0:14:26.960
make sure this is the beginning of a message. Then there's a direction bit, which tells

117
0:14:26.960 --> 0:14:34.320
whether this message is a request or a reply. And there's the attribute free bits, which

118
0:14:34.320 --> 0:14:43.720
are used to tell if this is a name or temperature message. Yes, there are extra, we only use

119
0:14:43.720 --> 0:14:48.240
one bit in the attribute, but that's just because they expect to expand the protocol

120
0:14:48.240 --> 0:14:53.720
someday. So this is an example of a sequence request

121
0:14:53.720 --> 0:15:02.200
reply. First we send the request with the header with the magic bits first, then it's

122
0:15:02.200 --> 0:15:07.560
a zero because the direction is a request. And then we're requesting one, which means

123
0:15:07.560 --> 0:15:12.840
we're requesting the temperature. And then the reply has almost the same header at the

124
0:15:12.840 --> 0:15:25.680
beginning is just one in place of the direction and then the bytes with the value after that.

125
0:15:25.680 --> 0:15:33.440
If you're requesting the name of the T-box, then it will respond with 12 bytes and it's

126
0:15:33.440 --> 0:15:38.560
always 12 bytes. If the name is shorter than 12 bytes, then the rest of the bytes are just

127
0:15:38.560 --> 0:15:48.920
null bytes. And that looks like this. If the name of the box is first, then you have six

128
0:15:48.920 --> 0:15:57.360
bytes of actual characters and then null bytes for the rest.

129
0:15:57.360 --> 0:16:02.600
And the temperature is a little more complicated. It has three fields. There's the time, which

130
0:16:02.600 --> 0:16:09.600
is a 32 bit integer. Counting the number of seconds since 1st of January 1970. Then there's

131
0:16:09.600 --> 0:16:14.640
the temperature, which is a 16 bit float. And then there's a quality byte which tells you

132
0:16:14.640 --> 0:16:22.480
whether there's an error in some of the measurements. It's the two last bits in the cube byte that

133
0:16:22.480 --> 0:16:26.680
are used. The second to last bit tells you there's an error in the clock. And the last

134
0:16:26.680 --> 0:16:32.040
bit tells you there's an error in the temperature measurement. And it's important to note that

135
0:16:32.040 --> 0:16:38.720
the numbers are a little Indian. So this is what a temperature value looks like. First

136
0:16:38.720 --> 0:16:43.600
it has a time stamp, which is a couple days ago. Then the temperature, which is 32 degrees

137
0:16:43.600 --> 0:16:52.920
about that. And then both of the error bits are high, so you should not trust this sample.

138
0:16:52.920 --> 0:17:01.360
So bit syntax. We want to send a request to the T-box to get the name. I used the double

139
0:17:01.360 --> 0:17:06.840
anchor brackets again. It's all integers and it's all unsigned, so the only thing I have

140
0:17:06.840 --> 0:17:13.480
to specify is the size. And here I specify the magic is four bits. Then I have my direction,

141
0:17:13.480 --> 0:17:22.920
one bit. And the attribute, which is zero for getting the name. So this shows how we

142
0:17:22.920 --> 0:17:31.320
can use the bits and text to easily encode things which are smaller than bytes. And the

143
0:17:31.320 --> 0:17:41.040
reply that comes back looks like this. But when we receive the reply, I do it like this.

144
0:17:41.040 --> 0:17:51.600
First I assert that the message I get back is what I expect. So in place of the header,

145
0:17:51.600 --> 0:17:56.720
I assert that the values are what I expect. I assert that I get the magic bits first,

146
0:17:56.720 --> 0:18:05.440
that I get the direction bit is high so that I know it's a reply. And that the attribute

147
0:18:05.440 --> 0:18:11.280
is zero so that I know it's a name. And when this is all true, I know that the rest of

148
0:18:11.280 --> 0:18:21.400
the message is 12 bytes long. And I want to assign that to the variable name. And here

149
0:18:21.400 --> 0:18:28.480
you can see I used the bytes modifier. This changes the type. And it changes the size

150
0:18:28.480 --> 0:18:34.400
or the unit property. So before with integers, I would specify, like in the header, you can

151
0:18:34.400 --> 0:18:40.800
see it's the colon, colon four for the magic. That means four bits. But when I specify bytes,

152
0:18:40.800 --> 0:18:47.840
that the type of name is bytes, then I also say that it's the 12 means 12 bytes long and

153
0:18:47.840 --> 0:18:57.160
not 12 bits long. Yeah, so that's just interesting that the bytes is the type that has different

154
0:18:57.160 --> 0:19:06.160
defaults than integers. When I get the T box temperature, I request it like this. Pretty

155
0:19:06.160 --> 0:19:12.400
much the same as before, just with a one for the attribute. And for the reply, I again

156
0:19:12.400 --> 0:19:17.800
assert on the header that I expect what I get back what I expect. Then I have the timestamp

157
0:19:17.800 --> 0:19:24.960
which was the 32 bit integer, but little indian. So let's put that in there. And the temperature,

158
0:19:24.960 --> 0:19:32.640
which is a float, 16 bits, also little indian. Then I discard six bits from the Q byte because

159
0:19:32.640 --> 0:19:37.800
they were not used. And then I just pluck the second to last and the last bit out as

160
0:19:37.800 --> 0:19:48.800
clock error and temperature error. Yeah. So that's the basics of bits and text. There's

161
0:19:48.800 --> 0:19:54.760
so much more to cover with writing whole applications to libraries to do this kind of stuff. Like

162
0:19:54.760 --> 0:20:00.640
what do we do when you don't receive the entire message at once? You have to frame messages

163
0:20:00.640 --> 0:20:08.200
when you're streaming them or receiving them as a stream. There's generators. There's a

164
0:20:08.200 --> 0:20:13.360
special, it looks like just a normal four generator, but it actually has some interlanks

165
0:20:13.360 --> 0:20:18.720
and special optimizations for working with binaries when you need to generate a binary.

166
0:20:18.720 --> 0:20:23.720
We could talk about performance tuning, but as I said, I've been working with this for

167
0:20:23.720 --> 0:20:27.800
years and I've never had to really do any performance tuning. It's pretty performant

168
0:20:27.800 --> 0:20:38.960
as is. That's also one of the points in the paper by Claire and Tony is that this is performant.

169
0:20:38.960 --> 0:20:43.800
And yeah, there are many other tools for working with binaries that help us when we're looking

170
0:20:43.800 --> 0:20:49.800
at this data and not understanding why it's not doing what we expect. WhyShark is definitely

171
0:20:49.800 --> 0:20:58.440
one of them. I recommend checking that out. I also recommend if you want to explore more

172
0:20:58.440 --> 0:21:07.000
depth that you check out ProtoHackers, which is a sort of admin of code challenge thing,

173
0:21:07.000 --> 0:21:13.600
but about the networking protocols. And Andrea Lo Party from the Elixir core team has a live

174
0:21:13.600 --> 0:21:17.840
stream on YouTube or has streams on YouTube where he sort of goes through the problems

175
0:21:17.840 --> 0:21:23.760
one by one. So that's very good for learning that. And they also started writing a book

176
0:21:23.760 --> 0:21:37.680
about this kind of stuff. So that's it. Thank you.

177
0:21:37.680 --> 0:21:51.880
And for the thought, Charles, do you have any questions?

178
0:21:51.880 --> 0:21:58.640
So I've done, I've implemented a few binary protocols like network protocols, like HTTP2

179
0:21:58.640 --> 0:22:06.680
or other stuff like that. I'd love to know how you, if you have done any like streaming

180
0:22:06.680 --> 0:22:12.160
of data and passing of messages coming from streaming data and generators also would be

181
0:22:12.160 --> 0:22:17.920
interesting. Just know like how you approached it because I know I did something, but I don't

182
0:22:17.920 --> 0:22:23.840
know how we did it. I think I've implemented a few protocols that use, for example, TCP

183
0:22:23.840 --> 0:22:29.520
as the underlying transport and then that's like a stream. And then there are a few patterns

184
0:22:29.520 --> 0:22:38.320
for how you want to handle that. I think Frank and the NERF team wrote a sort of framing

185
0:22:38.320 --> 0:22:43.760
behavior which where you have a couple of callbacks that you need to implement in order

186
0:22:43.760 --> 0:22:49.120
to handle a stream so that they give you bytes and then you return back messages when you

187
0:22:49.120 --> 0:22:54.960
see a full message. It's actually a very good sort of guideline for how to do that. Another

188
0:22:54.960 --> 0:23:01.880
approach is taken by Andrei Luapati in his library for the Redis, where it's like you

189
0:23:01.880 --> 0:23:09.160
call off when you call the decoding function and it returns a result, the result will be

190
0:23:09.160 --> 0:23:14.360
whatever messages was in that binary you gave it and then a continuation function which

191
0:23:14.360 --> 0:23:31.840
you call next time with more bytes so that continues to return new messages. Any question?

192
0:23:31.840 --> 0:23:39.280
If I would buy a T-box from you, do I still get support in about 16 years from now? No.

193
0:23:39.280 --> 0:23:46.760
Maybe five minutes. I actually have a question for you if there are no other questions. Do

194
0:23:46.760 --> 0:23:57.600
you have a library you suggest to see because I implemented a library to decode the QOAI

195
0:23:57.600 --> 0:24:02.760
which is the quite okay image format which is a new image format just to get my ions

196
0:24:02.760 --> 0:24:09.520
dirty with binary pattern matching in Elixir but it gets very unwieldy very fast. So I

197
0:24:09.520 --> 0:24:14.560
saw like in JZone they have some macros that generate binary pattern matching. Do you have

198
0:24:14.560 --> 0:24:24.560
any libraries you recommend to check out? I think the Redis library is pretty nice.

199
0:24:24.560 --> 0:24:30.200
I also have a KNX library which is like a small home protocol which I don't know if

200
0:24:30.200 --> 0:24:38.880
I would recommend but when I wrote it I thought it made sense. Okay, thank you. Any other

201
0:24:38.880 --> 0:24:49.480
questions? Okay. The last one I guess. Maybe a word about exceptions when patterns don't

202
0:24:49.480 --> 0:24:56.440
match. You didn't talk about that if I'm correct. That's true. I mean sometimes we say we should

203
0:24:56.440 --> 0:25:01.600
just let it crash and this community that's not always the case. Sometimes the protocol

204
0:25:01.600 --> 0:25:08.120
will say that if you're unable to decode a message you must ignore it and just continue

205
0:25:08.120 --> 0:25:17.760
going. In that case what I usually do is I define functions where I match on the data

206
0:25:17.760 --> 0:25:23.000
I received and then I always need to have a fallback clause in case it didn't match

207
0:25:23.000 --> 0:25:32.640
anything and then just lock an error and continue. But I mean probably the proper thing to do

208
0:25:32.640 --> 0:25:39.360
in Erlang is to just try to die. There's also you could when you receive a message you could

209
0:25:39.360 --> 0:25:45.680
have a special process that is only for decoding so you start a task, decode message and get

210
0:25:45.680 --> 0:25:52.880
the data structure back. But I think it depends on the use case how you want to handle bad

211
0:25:52.880 --> 0:25:56.920
data. Okay. Thank you very much.
