0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.880
Hi and welcome everyone.

2
0:00:08.880 --> 0:00:15.520
I'm here today to speak to you a little bit about Wiki Media's open source ecosystem.

3
0:00:15.520 --> 0:00:19.960
So I assume all of you know what Wikipedia is.

4
0:00:19.960 --> 0:00:26.460
And maybe some of you know that it runs on a software that is called MediaWiki.

5
0:00:26.460 --> 0:00:32.780
So all the wikis run on this software but there's also tens of thousands of websites

6
0:00:32.780 --> 0:00:34.480
around the world that use this.

7
0:00:34.480 --> 0:00:40.880
A very cool example is NASA is using it for some other projects.

8
0:00:40.880 --> 0:00:45.760
But this is sort of the core of Wikipedia and the other projects and it's of course

9
0:00:45.760 --> 0:00:49.720
something that is open source that anyone can contribute to.

10
0:00:49.720 --> 0:00:53.480
But it's not what I'm going to be talking about today.

11
0:00:53.480 --> 0:00:59.400
Because surrounding Wikipedia and all the other projects there is a huge ecosystem of

12
0:00:59.400 --> 0:01:01.400
software tools.

13
0:01:01.400 --> 0:01:07.640
You can think of these as like third party integrations.

14
0:01:07.640 --> 0:01:13.200
People build bots that do edits on Wikipedia that fight vandalism.

15
0:01:13.200 --> 0:01:15.680
There are machine learning algorithms.

16
0:01:15.680 --> 0:01:20.640
There are pipelines for data that then go to research purposes.

17
0:01:20.640 --> 0:01:22.320
There's a lot going on.

18
0:01:22.320 --> 0:01:28.600
So I'm going to be talking about this part.

19
0:01:28.600 --> 0:01:30.320
Just a quick word about me.

20
0:01:30.320 --> 0:01:34.280
I'm a software engineer with a technical engagement team.

21
0:01:34.280 --> 0:01:37.440
You can see we're part of the technology department.

22
0:01:37.440 --> 0:01:41.000
And our team is kind of split into parts.

23
0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:46.760
We have the cloud services team, SREs and engineers that build services and platforms

24
0:01:46.760 --> 0:01:49.800
for all these tool developers.

25
0:01:49.800 --> 0:01:51.080
Then we have developer advocacy.

26
0:01:51.080 --> 0:01:52.200
They do a lot of things.

27
0:01:52.200 --> 0:01:58.320
They are writing documents and running outreach programs.

28
0:01:58.320 --> 0:02:04.760
And doing everything so that our technical contributors can build cool stuff on top of

29
0:02:04.760 --> 0:02:10.400
our platforms and content.

30
0:02:10.400 --> 0:02:18.240
So just to give you an idea of the scale of this, we have over 300,000 editors that contribute

31
0:02:18.240 --> 0:02:22.040
to Wikimedia projects every month.

32
0:02:22.040 --> 0:02:27.680
Wikimedia Commons, which is the project that is for free media files, videos, images, so

33
0:02:27.680 --> 0:02:28.680
on.

34
0:02:28.680 --> 0:02:33.000
There are now over 90 million media files on there.

35
0:02:33.000 --> 0:02:39.480
And we have 1.7 billion unique devices that access Wikimedia against statistics for every

36
0:02:39.480 --> 0:02:42.600
month.

37
0:02:42.600 --> 0:02:45.640
So some of you may recognize at least some of these projects.

38
0:02:45.640 --> 0:02:48.680
Of course, Wikipedia is the flagship.

39
0:02:48.680 --> 0:02:53.640
There are other ones like Wikidata, Commons that we just mentioned, the dictionary, and

40
0:02:53.640 --> 0:02:58.120
many more.

41
0:02:58.120 --> 0:03:01.920
So yeah, we're going to take a look at these tools, ecosystems that I mentioned in the

42
0:03:01.920 --> 0:03:02.920
beginning.

43
0:03:02.920 --> 0:03:06.240
And we're going to start from Wikipedia.

44
0:03:06.240 --> 0:03:11.880
This is the thing that most people know about us.

45
0:03:11.880 --> 0:03:15.000
And from there, we're going to explore the tools that are community created software

46
0:03:15.000 --> 0:03:20.160
that interacts with and contributes to Wikimedia project in some way.

47
0:03:20.160 --> 0:03:21.880
An example here is PyWikibot.

48
0:03:21.880 --> 0:03:24.620
It's a framework for building bots.

49
0:03:24.620 --> 0:03:29.680
So if you have a wiki and you want to run some kind of bot that does something, some

50
0:03:29.680 --> 0:03:37.880
type of edits, you would very likely use PyWikibot as a framework to develop this.

51
0:03:37.880 --> 0:03:40.720
And yeah.

52
0:03:40.720 --> 0:03:45.040
From the tools themselves, we're going to go and have a look at the services and the

53
0:03:45.040 --> 0:03:49.640
platforms that support them.

54
0:03:49.640 --> 0:03:56.720
And we're going to start with an example of a couple tools and how they actually integrate

55
0:03:56.720 --> 0:03:59.440
with one of the projects.

56
0:03:59.440 --> 0:04:03.480
So this is a wiki project called Women in Red.

57
0:04:03.480 --> 0:04:08.080
And a wiki project is a group of users from Wikipedia that decide that they want to work

58
0:04:08.080 --> 0:04:13.120
on something specific, they come together to work as a group.

59
0:04:13.120 --> 0:04:17.480
And in this case, it's to fight the content gender gap.

60
0:04:17.480 --> 0:04:24.440
So they observed that only around 15% of English Wikipedia biographies were about women.

61
0:04:24.440 --> 0:04:33.080
And as of the 23rd of January this year, they have managed to take this number up to around

62
0:04:33.080 --> 0:04:40.120
90.45% in about seven or eight years.

63
0:04:40.120 --> 0:04:44.160
And so where does this very precise statistic come from?

64
0:04:44.160 --> 0:04:49.840
You can see mentioned here and in red it's something called human nicking.

65
0:04:49.840 --> 0:04:52.000
And so this is what we would call a tool.

66
0:04:52.000 --> 0:04:53.960
And in this case, this is a dashboard.

67
0:04:53.960 --> 0:04:59.920
It provides statistics about the gender gap on all the Wikimedia projects.

68
0:04:59.920 --> 0:05:07.120
And you can see here that female content is the orange part and then the rest is male.

69
0:05:07.120 --> 0:05:13.280
And if you go to this website, you can see it in a more granular way by country, by project,

70
0:05:13.280 --> 0:05:25.240
by date of birth and so on.

71
0:05:25.240 --> 0:05:31.300
So if you want to contribute to this project, an easy way to do it is to go to this Wiki

72
0:05:31.300 --> 0:05:34.680
Project site and you can see different lists that have been curated.

73
0:05:34.680 --> 0:05:38.840
For instance, here we can see female activists.

74
0:05:38.840 --> 0:05:43.760
So you can get a list of all the female activists.

75
0:05:43.760 --> 0:05:45.600
And there are many, many categories like this.

76
0:05:45.600 --> 0:05:52.040
And some of these lists are curated by humans, but most of these lists actually come from

77
0:05:52.040 --> 0:05:59.440
a bot that's called a Stereobol, which makes queries on Wikidata, which is another one

78
0:05:59.440 --> 0:06:00.440
of the projects.

79
0:06:00.440 --> 0:06:06.920
You can think of it like a huge knowledge graph that you can query using a similar language

80
0:06:06.920 --> 0:06:08.880
to SQL.

81
0:06:08.880 --> 0:06:10.680
It's called Sparkle.

82
0:06:10.680 --> 0:06:17.920
So you can use Wikidata to get lists with very high granularity.

83
0:06:17.920 --> 0:06:22.880
You can have activists from Germany or activists from Germany that were born after a certain

84
0:06:22.880 --> 0:06:24.600
date.

85
0:06:24.600 --> 0:06:30.720
And so this is what the Stereobol does.

86
0:06:30.720 --> 0:06:33.440
So we have seen two different tools.

87
0:06:33.440 --> 0:06:35.920
One was a dashboard, one was a bot.

88
0:06:35.920 --> 0:06:37.480
And there are thousands of these tools.

89
0:06:37.480 --> 0:06:40.880
There are thousands of maintainers.

90
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:48.320
And we're going to take a look at how we sustain these people.

91
0:06:48.320 --> 0:06:51.200
So I mentioned that my team is the cloud services team.

92
0:06:51.200 --> 0:06:54.320
And what we do is we provide hosting.

93
0:06:54.320 --> 0:06:58.080
We provide compute, virtual machines.

94
0:06:58.080 --> 0:07:03.240
We provide data services for all these tools to function.

95
0:07:03.240 --> 0:07:08.320
So again, to give you an idea of the scale of this, 30% of all the edits on Wikipedia

96
0:07:08.320 --> 0:07:13.240
as of 2020 were made by bots hosted on our services.

97
0:07:13.240 --> 0:07:15.520
For Wikidata, that number is a little bit higher.

98
0:07:15.520 --> 0:07:19.280
It's around 50%.

99
0:07:19.280 --> 0:07:27.680
So just to make you aware that this is a quite important part of the ecosystem.

100
0:07:27.680 --> 0:07:31.200
So I mentioned there are thousands of tools.

101
0:07:31.200 --> 0:07:37.160
And as of a couple years ago, we now have a catalog where you can browse and search

102
0:07:37.160 --> 0:07:39.120
and find a tool you need for your project.

103
0:07:39.120 --> 0:07:45.200
Or if you are a tool maintainer, you can add it here so that people know it exists.

104
0:07:45.200 --> 0:07:49.280
Then what you see here are lists that have been curated.

105
0:07:49.280 --> 0:07:51.840
We have something called a Coolest Tool Award.

106
0:07:51.840 --> 0:08:03.080
If you look down, you can see that Humanike was one of the award-winning tools in 2021.

107
0:08:03.080 --> 0:08:06.040
Some of you may recognize this as a Jupyter notebook.

108
0:08:06.040 --> 0:08:12.320
So this is a Jupyter hub deployment that we have that is directly integrated with all

109
0:08:12.320 --> 0:08:18.120
of our data services so that people can access dumps, they can access Wiki Replicas, they

110
0:08:18.120 --> 0:08:24.920
can access a lot of things that otherwise would be gigabyte and gigabyte and gigabyte

111
0:08:24.920 --> 0:08:32.280
of data they would have to download onto their own computers.

112
0:08:32.280 --> 0:08:35.200
A similar tool is called Quarry.

113
0:08:35.200 --> 0:08:39.280
It's a public query interface for Wiki Replicas.

114
0:08:39.280 --> 0:08:40.960
Wiki Replicas, I didn't mention it.

115
0:08:40.960 --> 0:08:45.800
There are replicas of our production databases.

116
0:08:45.800 --> 0:08:49.760
And the cool thing about this is that all the queries are public.

117
0:08:49.760 --> 0:08:55.720
So people can actually search and see other people's queries and be inspired.

118
0:08:55.720 --> 0:09:01.720
Or if you're not very good with SQL, well, you can adapt someone's query to your needs.

119
0:09:01.720 --> 0:09:15.120
Here you can see a specific query.

120
0:09:15.120 --> 0:09:21.720
So these services are still kind of tools that serve this ecosystem, but we also need

121
0:09:21.720 --> 0:09:25.160
somewhere to host them.

122
0:09:25.160 --> 0:09:27.840
So we have a platform as a services offering.

123
0:09:27.840 --> 0:09:30.440
It's called Toolforge.

124
0:09:30.440 --> 0:09:34.880
It's not quite as fancy as Heroku or DigitalOcean or anything of this sort.

125
0:09:34.880 --> 0:09:38.840
If you look closely, you see that you have to actually SSH into it.

126
0:09:38.840 --> 0:09:43.240
But it's still very powerful and very convenient for our users.

127
0:09:43.240 --> 0:09:50.080
It integrates again with data sources and it has managed databases, a Redis instance,

128
0:09:50.080 --> 0:09:58.080
a Elasticsearch cluster that everyone can use without having to maintain all these systems

129
0:09:58.080 --> 0:10:00.360
themselves.

130
0:10:00.360 --> 0:10:05.160
So yeah, the back end here is Kubernetes.

131
0:10:05.160 --> 0:10:12.720
Then for more complicated projects, some projects need more compute, for instance.

132
0:10:12.720 --> 0:10:19.880
We also have a Cloud VPS offering so that people can spin up their own virtual machines

133
0:10:19.880 --> 0:10:23.440
and basically do what they want on them.

134
0:10:23.440 --> 0:10:32.000
So this runs on top of OpenStack.

135
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:36.040
And how could one get involved with this?

136
0:10:36.040 --> 0:10:44.320
So it's possible to get involved in any of these layers, either as a tool maintainer

137
0:10:44.320 --> 0:10:49.840
or as maintainer of any of these platforms.

138
0:10:49.840 --> 0:10:55.320
And that's kind of the thing I wanted to highlight a little bit today, is that this is kind of

139
0:10:55.320 --> 0:11:07.520
a unique opportunity to actually contribute to platform and to infrastructure.

140
0:11:07.520 --> 0:11:16.000
We have people that work with our team and they are on our IRC channels and they push

141
0:11:16.000 --> 0:11:17.800
patches just like everyone else.

142
0:11:17.800 --> 0:11:21.720
And if you don't know, you would think they are just another software engineer on the

143
0:11:21.720 --> 0:11:23.280
team.

144
0:11:23.280 --> 0:11:29.000
And I asked some of them, what brings you here?

145
0:11:29.000 --> 0:11:33.720
And of course, many of them associate with their free knowledge and free knowledge movement

146
0:11:33.720 --> 0:11:36.000
and open source and all of that.

147
0:11:36.000 --> 0:11:41.960
But many also said that this is a unique opportunity to actually play with things like OpenStack

148
0:11:41.960 --> 0:11:48.400
or Terraform or Kubernetes in a situation where actually you have real traffic and real

149
0:11:48.400 --> 0:11:53.120
users which is something that is kind of very difficult to do at home.

150
0:11:53.120 --> 0:12:01.040
And there are not many other projects where you would have this possibility.

151
0:12:01.040 --> 0:12:08.540
So some ways to get involved.

152
0:12:08.540 --> 0:12:11.300
We have several outreach programs.

153
0:12:11.300 --> 0:12:16.120
We have Outreachy which is an internship that runs twice a year.

154
0:12:16.120 --> 0:12:22.960
It's targeted more towards underrepresented demographic.

155
0:12:22.960 --> 0:12:26.000
Google Summer of Code, that's once a year.

156
0:12:26.000 --> 0:12:30.680
And both programs are open to anyone.

157
0:12:30.680 --> 0:12:32.320
So you don't have to be a student.

158
0:12:32.320 --> 0:12:37.720
You can be someone who is changing careers or doing some kind of a letter move.

159
0:12:37.720 --> 0:12:41.240
Google Summer of Code has also become more flexible.

160
0:12:41.240 --> 0:12:42.640
It's not just summer anymore.

161
0:12:42.640 --> 0:12:43.640
There are shorter projects.

162
0:12:43.640 --> 0:12:45.760
There are longer projects.

163
0:12:45.760 --> 0:12:54.920
So that could be a way to get involved and get some kind of hands-on mentorship.

164
0:12:54.920 --> 0:12:58.040
Another way would be to come to the Wikimedia Hackathons.

165
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:02.120
We have one in Athens in May this year.

166
0:13:02.120 --> 0:13:07.880
And then one is part of Wikimedia that takes part in Singapore, that is in Singapore in

167
0:13:07.880 --> 0:13:10.640
August.

168
0:13:10.640 --> 0:13:15.960
And of course if you are brave you can just dive right in because everything we do is

169
0:13:15.960 --> 0:13:20.280
open and it's out there on the internet.

170
0:13:20.280 --> 0:13:27.400
Documentation of course but like just even our project boards and fabricator that's a

171
0:13:27.400 --> 0:13:32.320
collaborative software for task management and such.

172
0:13:32.320 --> 0:13:35.720
So if you go there you will see that there is a huge variety of tasks.

173
0:13:35.720 --> 0:13:40.160
You can see the work boards of different teams at the foundation.

174
0:13:40.160 --> 0:13:46.800
You can see volunteer led projects and projects where people work together alongside each

175
0:13:46.800 --> 0:13:48.840
other.

So a way could be simply to find something that interests you and look at the documentation

177
0:13:55.720 --> 0:14:06.280
and then come on our IRC channels and contact us and that's it.

178
0:14:06.280 --> 0:14:13.760
So yeah I have added some links which can be helpful to get started.

179
0:14:13.760 --> 0:14:17.000
And you are of course free to just reach out to me.

180
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:19.280
I had my Twitter handle on the first slide.

181
0:14:19.280 --> 0:14:23.480
My slides are published on the website.

182
0:14:23.480 --> 0:14:31.040
We have 45 seconds for questions.

183
0:14:31.040 --> 0:14:32.040
Thank you.

184
0:14:32.040 --> 0:14:37.160
