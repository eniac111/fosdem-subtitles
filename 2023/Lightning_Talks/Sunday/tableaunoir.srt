1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.200
Okay, so hello everyone.

2
0:00:07.200 --> 0:00:08.200
I am Francois-Schwarz-Senterberg.

3
0:00:08.200 --> 0:00:18.140
I am really glad to be here and I will present to you Tablonoix, which is an online blackboard.

4
0:00:18.140 --> 0:00:28.480
So a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a mysterious virus attacked the population.

5
0:00:28.480 --> 0:00:35.200
So it attacked almost everybody.

6
0:00:35.200 --> 0:00:42.880
And that's why we decided to organize a lockdown, right?

7
0:00:42.880 --> 0:00:53.080
But we still had to teach and actually we did blackboards to teach and we are not able

8
0:00:53.080 --> 0:00:57.300
to use blackboards anymore.

9
0:00:57.300 --> 0:01:03.800
And actually there exists solutions online that enables to draw and share ideas, but

10
0:01:03.800 --> 0:01:08.920
they don't fit completely the needs.

11
0:01:08.920 --> 0:01:15.120
Some of them looks really like, I would say, graphical drawing softwares.

12
0:01:15.120 --> 0:01:21.200
So with many buttons and usually you need to get rid from all these buttons that are

13
0:01:21.200 --> 0:01:23.920
on the screen.

14
0:01:23.920 --> 0:01:33.280
So usually when you have to explain things, you need to make animations and to make students

15
0:01:33.280 --> 0:01:34.800
interact with you.

16
0:01:34.800 --> 0:01:44.580
So for instance, you know maybe sorting algorithms, like insertion, sort.

17
0:01:44.580 --> 0:01:46.880
And you can use Manette for that.

18
0:01:46.880 --> 0:01:48.620
It's very easy on a blackboard.

19
0:01:48.620 --> 0:01:53.800
You have Manette like that and you can teach, okay, you have to insert five in this.

20
0:01:53.800 --> 0:02:00.200
So you will move this and put five here and nine will be here, okay?

21
0:02:00.200 --> 0:02:10.000
And this is very difficult to use that with real blackboards, with existing tools, solutions

22
0:02:10.000 --> 0:02:11.000
that are online.

23
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:16.560
Also many of them, when you go on the website, you have to sign.

24
0:02:16.560 --> 0:02:24.920
And maybe you don't want to sign up and to give data to the services that offer some

25
0:02:24.920 --> 0:02:27.640
white or blackboards online.

26
0:02:27.640 --> 0:02:33.520
And also when you are using them, actually their server, they keep all your data maybe.

27
0:02:33.520 --> 0:02:37.500
They store your information and you don't want that.

28
0:02:37.500 --> 0:02:43.320
So that's why we decided to create Tableau Noir, which is available on this web page.

29
0:02:43.320 --> 0:02:47.960
You can, so it's online, it's also offline.

30
0:02:47.960 --> 0:02:54.680
You can also use Tableau Noir offline with Electron, which is a kind of software to make

31
0:02:54.680 --> 0:02:57.920
websites used like offline.

32
0:02:57.920 --> 0:03:00.920
It's collaborative and that's it.

33
0:03:00.920 --> 0:03:05.200
So now the rest of the presentation is divided in several parts.

34
0:03:05.200 --> 0:03:08.120
The first part I will discuss the philosophy of the tool.

35
0:03:08.120 --> 0:03:14.760
The second part I will explain a bit more the use of this fridge manniette here.

36
0:03:14.760 --> 0:03:18.360
Then we will discuss the collaborative board aspect of Tableau Noir.

37
0:03:18.360 --> 0:03:23.760
Then I will discuss how to make a presentation with Tableau Noir and finally we'll conclude.

38
0:03:23.760 --> 0:03:26.520
So what is the philosophy of Tableau Noir?

39
0:03:26.520 --> 0:03:28.520
The philosophy is kiss.

40
0:03:28.520 --> 0:03:30.800
So maybe you know this philosophy.

41
0:03:30.800 --> 0:03:35.560
This philosophy means keep it simple and stupid.

42
0:03:35.560 --> 0:03:38.200
This is a bit the philosophy behind Tableau Noir.

43
0:03:38.200 --> 0:03:43.600
So if you have a lot of tools like that in your drawing software, actually you don't

44
0:03:43.600 --> 0:03:49.320
need them because if you want to select a part of your board when you teach, you don't

45
0:03:49.320 --> 0:03:54.000
have time to select the correct tool selecting and then blah, blah, blah.

46
0:03:54.000 --> 0:03:56.120
You will use directly.

47
0:03:56.120 --> 0:04:02.160
Suppose you have this little guy and you want to move this guy on the board, but you just

48
0:04:02.160 --> 0:04:12.200
select with the shock you put around and then control X and boom you can move the little

49
0:04:12.200 --> 0:04:14.000
guy or little girl.

50
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:15.760
So we don't need this button.

51
0:04:15.760 --> 0:04:19.040
Now you have a button for shock and erase.

52
0:04:19.040 --> 0:04:21.320
You just have one button for toggling.

53
0:04:21.320 --> 0:04:22.720
It's sufficient.

54
0:04:22.720 --> 0:04:32.060
Then you have usually in drawing software you can draw more thick or thin lines.

55
0:04:32.060 --> 0:04:34.240
But with a shock you don't need.

56
0:04:34.240 --> 0:04:37.720
You do that.

57
0:04:37.720 --> 0:04:41.880
So let's get rid of these buttons too.

58
0:04:41.880 --> 0:04:43.600
Button for the type of line is the same.

59
0:04:43.600 --> 0:04:46.040
It's very easy to do that when you teach.

60
0:04:46.040 --> 0:04:47.920
So we don't need that.

61
0:04:47.920 --> 0:04:50.400
Zoom we don't need also.

62
0:04:50.400 --> 0:04:54.720
I will explain that later why we don't need that.

63
0:04:54.720 --> 0:04:58.280
So the tool Tableau Noir is teaching oriented.

64
0:04:58.280 --> 0:05:00.760
You can hide the toolbar.

65
0:05:00.760 --> 0:05:05.040
There is a toolbar but usually you hide it.

66
0:05:05.040 --> 0:05:06.960
We don't care about the toolbar.

67
0:05:06.960 --> 0:05:17.200
You have short keys like C. If you press C you can change the color of your shock and

68
0:05:17.200 --> 0:05:19.400
so on.

69
0:05:19.400 --> 0:05:21.280
Dynamic size of the eraser.

70
0:05:21.280 --> 0:05:28.560
Usually when you erase in drawing software you have to choose the size of your eraser.

71
0:05:28.560 --> 0:05:32.800
When you teach you don't have time, maybe this size is good.

72
0:05:32.800 --> 0:05:40.360
When you erase, if you do it slowly you erase not so much.

73
0:05:40.360 --> 0:05:46.000
And if you start to then it will be big.

74
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:50.960
Cool.

75
0:05:50.960 --> 0:05:52.480
Accessibility.

76
0:05:52.480 --> 0:05:56.920
Some persons are left handed and others are right handed.

77
0:05:56.920 --> 0:06:02.560
So on the project I had a request about that and I think it's important that everybody

78
0:06:02.560 --> 0:06:08.800
can use Tableau Noir so you can flip also the cursor.

79
0:06:08.800 --> 0:06:19.520
You can add text and also later formula in your lecture.

80
0:06:19.520 --> 0:06:21.080
So now let's talk about manettes.

81
0:06:21.080 --> 0:06:26.020
So manettes are things you can move on the board.

82
0:06:26.020 --> 0:06:36.800
So you can for instance explain the sort algorithms directly in Tableau Noir by moving the manettes.

83
0:06:36.800 --> 0:06:39.960
Actually you also have manettes from OpenMoji.

84
0:06:39.960 --> 0:06:41.520
This is a very nice project.

85
0:06:41.520 --> 0:06:46.280
I accidentally went on this.

86
0:06:46.280 --> 0:06:51.960
It's all like icons for.

87
0:06:51.960 --> 0:06:59.160
And Tableau Noir provides these icons in the interface so you can use this little picture

88
0:06:59.160 --> 0:07:03.160
for whatever you want.

89
0:07:03.160 --> 0:07:07.020
You can make interactive diagrams.

90
0:07:07.020 --> 0:07:13.960
So for instance you can draw graphs where the manettes are the nodes and you have edges

91
0:07:13.960 --> 0:07:16.440
that you have drawn by hand.

92
0:07:16.440 --> 0:07:27.480
And then interestingly you can move the manettes and the graph will be updated accordingly.

93
0:07:27.480 --> 0:07:30.360
You can also put a manette in the background.

94
0:07:30.360 --> 0:07:38.560
So if you have a grid and you want to draw on the top of the grid so you can transform

95
0:07:38.560 --> 0:07:44.680
that into a manette and then put the manettes in the background by pressing B and then you

96
0:07:44.680 --> 0:07:52.120
can draw on the top and especially when you erase you will not erase the grid.

97
0:07:52.120 --> 0:07:57.880
Otherwise you have to redraw it and it's boring.

98
0:07:57.880 --> 0:08:04.120
Let's talk now about the collaborative aspect of Tableau Noir.

99
0:08:04.120 --> 0:08:09.880
So interestingly if you are alone, if you use Tableau Noir alone, there is no communication

100
0:08:09.880 --> 0:08:11.720
with the server.

101
0:08:11.720 --> 0:08:13.320
Nothing.

102
0:08:13.320 --> 0:08:18.000
You're not just loading the HTML file and JavaScript otherwise.

103
0:08:18.000 --> 0:08:21.280
Then during the interaction there is no communication with the server.

104
0:08:21.280 --> 0:08:29.640
But as long as you click on this button which is here, you will share the board, right?

105
0:08:29.640 --> 0:08:32.840
And then it will contact the server.

106
0:08:32.840 --> 0:08:40.440
So in the Tableau Noir.github.io, the official address, it will contact the server that is

107
0:08:40.440 --> 0:08:43.080
located in my lab in REN.

108
0:08:43.080 --> 0:08:51.240
And it will create a shared board and you can share the URL with others.

109
0:08:51.240 --> 0:08:55.240
And then when you share the URL, they are all connected and when you draw something

110
0:08:55.240 --> 0:08:59.520
you have messages that are passing and giving the information that has been done on the

111
0:08:59.520 --> 0:09:00.520
board.

112
0:09:00.520 --> 0:09:04.040
That's somehow how it's implemented.

113
0:09:04.040 --> 0:09:06.600
So the server is written in JavaScript.

114
0:09:06.600 --> 0:09:10.160
It's very small in Node.js.

115
0:09:10.160 --> 0:09:17.040
And the client, so it's a bundle file and the entire project is written in TypeScript.

116
0:09:17.040 --> 0:09:25.320
Using some libraries to, yeah, I don't have the list here but, no.

117
0:09:25.320 --> 0:09:30.960
So the features of the, when you share the board, so you have no account, you can protect

118
0:09:30.960 --> 0:09:32.280
a board with a password.

119
0:09:32.280 --> 0:09:39.480
So by protect I mean some users may not have the right to draw on the blackboard.

120
0:09:39.480 --> 0:09:44.280
They only have the right to see the blackboard.

121
0:09:44.280 --> 0:09:50.120
And those data are stored on the server so it means if everybody is stopping the session,

122
0:09:50.120 --> 0:09:56.840
sorry for that, data are lost, so you have to save manually the blackboard when you want

123
0:09:56.840 --> 0:09:59.240
to.

124
0:09:59.240 --> 0:10:02.840
Ah, there is no zoom.

125
0:10:02.840 --> 0:10:03.840
Why?

126
0:10:03.840 --> 0:10:07.720
Because suppose we have zoom on a blackboard.

127
0:10:07.720 --> 0:10:13.920
If somebody is writing something, for instance, okay, everything is okay.

128
0:10:13.920 --> 0:10:17.960
And the other person is writing hello.

129
0:10:17.960 --> 0:10:23.080
But this person is not seeing it because the zoom is not the same.

130
0:10:23.080 --> 0:10:26.480
So if you introduce zoom, you will get troubles.

131
0:10:26.480 --> 0:10:32.480
So that's why we decided not to have zoom.

132
0:10:32.480 --> 0:10:36.240
So the solution, if you don't have zoom, everybody is seeing the same thing.

133
0:10:36.240 --> 0:10:40.960
We are happy and that's it.

134
0:10:40.960 --> 0:10:43.600
Okay.

135
0:10:43.600 --> 0:10:49.920
So with this tool actually, so this is a kind of new feature that has been added afterwards.

136
0:10:49.920 --> 0:10:53.840
We can now make presentation with tableau noir.

137
0:10:53.840 --> 0:11:01.800
And actually the presentation that you are seeing is made in tableau noir.

138
0:11:01.800 --> 0:11:10.640
So actually, so it's not completely clear, but it's like we have another way to do presentations.

139
0:11:10.640 --> 0:11:14.880
So I will divide the way to make presentation in three.

140
0:11:14.880 --> 0:11:20.000
You have Librefist style, Lattech Bimmer style and tableau noir.

141
0:11:20.000 --> 0:11:24.000
So how do you make animations?

142
0:11:24.000 --> 0:11:30.880
In Librefist, you have to navigate through a lot of menus to see, ah, I want to move

143
0:11:30.880 --> 0:11:36.680
this on the left, coming from the right and so on.

144
0:11:36.680 --> 0:11:39.640
Okay.

145
0:11:39.640 --> 0:11:46.360
In Lattech, you have to write, sorry, I write this type of codes many times.

146
0:11:46.360 --> 0:11:50.400
You have to write some obscure code to encode animations.

147
0:11:50.400 --> 0:11:54.600
You can say, ah, this is on the slide, not on the next slide and so on.

148
0:11:54.600 --> 0:11:59.920
And kind of in tableau noir, you just do it.

149
0:11:59.920 --> 0:12:04.960
So maybe we can make a demo.

150
0:12:04.960 --> 0:12:09.760
We have one minute for the demo.

151
0:12:09.760 --> 0:12:15.960
So let's suppose we are at the first demo.

152
0:12:15.960 --> 0:12:19.000
And we want to explain how we arrive at the first demo.

153
0:12:19.000 --> 0:12:21.840
So there is a little cat.

154
0:12:21.840 --> 0:12:22.840
This is not a cat.

155
0:12:22.840 --> 0:12:25.920
This is the cat, no?

156
0:12:25.920 --> 0:12:26.920
Okay.

157
0:12:26.920 --> 0:12:31.800
This is my first slide, okay?

158
0:12:31.800 --> 0:12:34.800
So now I create a new slide from here.

159
0:12:34.800 --> 0:12:36.160
Boom.

160
0:12:36.160 --> 0:12:38.280
And we have this cat.

161
0:12:38.280 --> 0:12:42.040
And this cat is going to the first demo.

162
0:12:42.040 --> 0:12:43.640
Okay.

163
0:12:43.640 --> 0:12:47.000
So now we have two slides, this one and this one.

164
0:12:47.000 --> 0:12:48.320
Okay.

165
0:12:48.320 --> 0:12:52.800
Now maybe we create a new slide where we erase everything.

166
0:12:52.800 --> 0:12:54.680
And you have, I don't know, this.

167
0:12:54.680 --> 0:12:55.680
I am improving.

168
0:12:55.680 --> 0:12:57.280
Sorry.

169
0:12:57.280 --> 0:12:59.960
Maybe if you have ideas, don't hesitate.

170
0:12:59.960 --> 0:13:00.960
T-shirt.

171
0:13:00.960 --> 0:13:01.960
Ah, T-shirt.

172
0:13:01.960 --> 0:13:02.960
Okay.

173
0:13:02.960 --> 0:13:04.960
So we have a T-shirt.

174
0:13:04.960 --> 0:13:13.520
And the cat.

175
0:13:13.520 --> 0:13:17.600
And then, so this is a slide, right?

176
0:13:17.600 --> 0:13:24.000
And then it takes the T-shirt and goes home.

177
0:13:24.000 --> 0:13:38.080
So let's see the presentation.

178
0:13:38.080 --> 0:13:39.640
So hello, I'm a cat.

179
0:13:39.640 --> 0:13:41.120
I want to go to the first demo.

180
0:13:41.120 --> 0:13:42.560
I enter it.

181
0:13:42.560 --> 0:13:44.000
And I want to have a T-shirt.

182
0:13:44.000 --> 0:13:45.640
So you have a T-shirt here.

183
0:13:45.640 --> 0:13:47.760
The cat is quite happy.

184
0:13:47.760 --> 0:13:51.440
And he gets home with the T-shirt.

185
0:13:51.440 --> 0:13:53.440
Okay.

186
0:13:53.440 --> 0:13:57.840
So conclusion.

187
0:13:57.840 --> 0:14:08.480
So kind of table noir can be summed up.

188
0:14:08.480 --> 0:14:11.200
It fits the teachers and students' need.

189
0:14:11.200 --> 0:14:14.440
Plus the kiss principle, keep it simple, stupid.

190
0:14:14.440 --> 0:14:16.880
Plus a bit of nostalgia.

191
0:14:16.880 --> 0:14:23.160
You have the real blackboard aspects, which is not completely clean, but you have like

192
0:14:23.160 --> 0:14:24.160
of dust.

193
0:14:24.160 --> 0:14:27.600
Dust that is a bit of dust.

194
0:14:27.600 --> 0:14:28.600
Yes.

195
0:14:28.600 --> 0:14:32.600
Video game aspects with a circular menu.

196
0:14:32.600 --> 0:14:39.680
With also, like if you draw something very far like this, you will have the overview

197
0:14:39.680 --> 0:14:42.840
of the map of the board.

198
0:14:42.840 --> 0:14:48.440
So kind of Zelda games or whatever.

199
0:14:48.440 --> 0:14:54.040
So now I am tempted to add new features.

200
0:14:54.040 --> 0:14:59.120
But this is the opposite of kiss.

201
0:14:59.120 --> 0:15:06.200
So I would be very glad to discuss with you about some features that I would like to add.

202
0:15:06.200 --> 0:15:07.200
And that's it.

203
0:15:07.200 --> 0:15:09.920
Thank you for your attention.

204
0:15:09.920 --> 0:15:11.920
Thank you.

205
0:15:11.920 --> 0:15:18.080
Really cool project.

206
0:15:18.080 --> 0:15:19.280
I think we all agree.

207
0:15:19.280 --> 0:15:20.280
So thank you.

208
0:15:20.280 --> 0:15:22.000
Thanks a lot for the presentation.

209
0:15:22.000 --> 0:15:27.760
And if you guys have any questions, feel free to grab them outside and ask your questions.

210
0:15:27.760 --> 0:15:28.760
Thank you.

211
0:15:28.760 --> 0:15:49.440
Thank you.
