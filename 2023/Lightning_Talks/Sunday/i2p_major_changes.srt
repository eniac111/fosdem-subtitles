0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.080
Hi everyone, this is I2P major changes of the Peer2Peer network by Konrad BÃ¤chler.

2
0:00:13.080 --> 0:00:15.920
Almost close enough.

3
0:00:15.920 --> 0:00:16.920
Enjoy.

4
0:00:16.920 --> 0:00:17.920
Hello everyone.

5
0:00:17.920 --> 0:00:19.360
Thank you for being here.

6
0:00:19.360 --> 0:00:22.240
That's my third I2P talk at Fosstem.

7
0:00:22.240 --> 0:00:23.240
First one was about DNS.

8
0:00:23.240 --> 0:00:25.680
That was the most difficult for me personally.

9
0:00:25.680 --> 0:00:31.040
That was JavaScript which was also difficult for me and now a major changes of the Peer2Peer

10
0:00:31.040 --> 0:00:40.840
network of a bunch of programmers which are creating I2P which is an overlay network.

11
0:00:40.840 --> 0:00:47.080
I'm an independent researcher and software architect and developer and I'm developing

12
0:00:47.080 --> 0:00:55.120
libraries and I'm working full time for D.W.Xchange which is a small non-profit association in

13
0:00:55.120 --> 0:00:57.440
the world.

14
0:00:57.440 --> 0:01:01.280
There is nothing like a centralized model involved because I'm totally living in the

15
0:01:01.280 --> 0:01:06.800
Peer2Peer I2P world because I really love what the I2P developers and the open-source

16
0:01:06.800 --> 0:01:10.480
space are doing since the last 20 years.

17
0:01:10.480 --> 0:01:14.240
I suggest we're looking now at the agenda.

18
0:01:14.240 --> 0:01:18.920
I give you a short introduction of I2P and then we're looking at what the developers

19
0:01:18.920 --> 0:01:28.480
did as the latest changes of the code and we'll focus since I'm an application developer

20
0:01:28.480 --> 0:01:31.840
based on the I2P network, what is the impact?

21
0:01:31.840 --> 0:01:37.720
We're looking at the summary and I understood that there are no questions so if you have

22
0:01:37.720 --> 0:01:42.840
questions I'll be outside in the hall for a few minutes and I'm happy to get in touch

23
0:01:42.840 --> 0:01:49.480
with you if you have critical and skeptical questions.

24
0:01:49.480 --> 0:01:52.600
Sure thing, what is the role of D.W.Xchange within I2P?

25
0:01:52.600 --> 0:01:59.220
I2P is a developer team, D.W.Xchange is a developer team and the I2P developers are

26
0:01:59.220 --> 0:02:00.720
spread all over the world.

27
0:02:00.720 --> 0:02:03.560
The D.W. developers are spread all over the world.

28
0:02:03.560 --> 0:02:06.840
We're cooperating friendly but we're not the same.

29
0:02:06.840 --> 0:02:15.920
D.W.Xchange is primarily a library developer and is supporting so-called official open

30
0:02:15.920 --> 0:02:18.200
source to Docker images.

31
0:02:18.200 --> 0:02:19.200
That's what we're doing.

32
0:02:19.200 --> 0:02:24.640
Myself, since I'm a researcher I'm cooperating with Swiss universities and I'm open for all

33
0:02:24.640 --> 0:02:31.760
corporations with any university to take a very skeptical perspective towards our own

34
0:02:31.760 --> 0:02:33.960
work.

35
0:02:33.960 --> 0:02:35.440
Now what is the I2P network?

36
0:02:35.440 --> 0:02:38.280
I2P network is an overlay network.

37
0:02:38.280 --> 0:02:44.720
An overlay network and now please jump to the very last line of this slide.

38
0:02:44.720 --> 0:02:51.300
I2P gives you privacy by design, serious privacy by design.

39
0:02:51.300 --> 0:02:55.720
It means you get confidentiality and total anonymity.

40
0:02:55.720 --> 0:03:03.700
Just an example, this statement that the network gives you total anonymity is something which

41
0:03:03.700 --> 0:03:08.880
we do research in Switzerland whether we can break this anonymity and that's one of our

42
0:03:08.880 --> 0:03:10.200
research approaches.

43
0:03:10.200 --> 0:03:20.440
But currently, at the current stage of knowledge and since I2P is existing since 20 years,

44
0:03:20.440 --> 0:03:23.400
we can say it's confidential and anonymous.

45
0:03:23.400 --> 0:03:29.240
Now a question, whoever in this room in the past presentations there was around 5% of

46
0:03:29.240 --> 0:03:33.680
the audience have ever got in touch and used I2P in their life.

47
0:03:33.680 --> 0:03:35.680
Please hands up.

48
0:03:35.680 --> 0:03:38.400
Wow, that's close to 20%.

49
0:03:38.400 --> 0:03:40.800
Cool, thank you.

50
0:03:40.800 --> 0:03:47.960
For the others which do not know it, anonymity has a cost attached and this cost is called

51
0:03:47.960 --> 0:03:49.520
latency.

52
0:03:49.520 --> 0:03:54.600
When I'm talking about an anonymous network which gives you full confidentiality, then

53
0:03:54.600 --> 0:04:02.920
these messages are multiple time encrypted and hop from peer to peer to its destination

54
0:04:02.920 --> 0:04:08.120
and through another tunnel they hop back, the reply hops back.

55
0:04:08.120 --> 0:04:13.960
And this is giving anonymity on a very, very, very high level.

56
0:04:13.960 --> 0:04:21.740
A word to be clear here, I2P has no storage capability by itself.

57
0:04:21.740 --> 0:04:26.080
It's a transport layer.

58
0:04:26.080 --> 0:04:28.740
Now how to get I2P?

59
0:04:28.740 --> 0:04:31.600
Those which got in touch with it, they know that.

60
0:04:31.600 --> 0:04:35.700
There are the Linux Red Pose and then there are PPAs and then there are the container

61
0:04:35.700 --> 0:04:40.000
maintained by DevoExchange which you find on Docker.

62
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:43.680
Now why is there I2P and why is there I2PD?

63
0:04:43.680 --> 0:04:49.140
Because there are two versions available from two development teams.

64
0:04:49.140 --> 0:04:55.880
In short, I2P is written in Java, it has a user interface and there are a lot of fans

65
0:04:55.880 --> 0:05:01.480
around there which really like that and then there is a smaller version which is I2PD which

66
0:05:01.480 --> 0:05:06.920
is written in C++ and which is a daemon only so it's rather a bit more for odd means.

67
0:05:06.920 --> 0:05:13.360
Devo uses I2PD and there's also the image maintainer on Docker for this version.

68
0:05:13.360 --> 0:05:17.600
From my point of view, both are equally valid.

69
0:05:17.600 --> 0:05:22.640
Bit of warning, please don't trust any binaries which are floating around here and there which

70
0:05:22.640 --> 0:05:25.360
you can't reproduce locally by yourself.

71
0:05:25.360 --> 0:05:32.680
Please build it yourself if you can and sure you can because this gives power to the open

72
0:05:32.680 --> 0:05:34.480
source developers.

73
0:05:34.480 --> 0:05:38.240
If you just consume some binaries, please don't.

74
0:05:38.240 --> 0:05:44.080
It's also dangerous because you have a router running on your local machine.

75
0:05:44.080 --> 0:05:49.440
The whole thing here is it's a peer-to-peer network without any central authority, without

76
0:05:49.440 --> 0:05:52.880
any trust involved.

77
0:05:52.880 --> 0:05:58.400
Now the latest changes.

78
0:05:58.400 --> 0:06:12.040
Since 20 years, I2P is existing and gets developed and there are two transport protocols, TCP

79
0:06:12.040 --> 0:06:14.280
and UDP.

80
0:06:14.280 --> 0:06:18.760
TCP is also used within other overlay networks.

81
0:06:18.760 --> 0:06:26.480
Was along a while so around four years already upgraded to so-called NTCP2 which is much

82
0:06:26.480 --> 0:06:32.920
modernized so the TCP communication was already pretty well done in the last four years.

83
0:06:32.920 --> 0:06:39.400
But UDP which is something where you just blow out messages to the network and I'll

84
0:06:39.400 --> 0:06:48.200
talk about that in a minute which is fast for I2P in an I2P context was not modernized

85
0:06:48.200 --> 0:06:50.800
since 15 years.

86
0:06:50.800 --> 0:06:59.720
The developer of I2P, they worked one full year on modernizing UDP and they call it SSU2.

87
0:06:59.720 --> 0:07:06.840
When you hear SSU2 in the context of I2P, it's UDP.

88
0:07:06.840 --> 0:07:13.240
If you want to dig deeper, deeper, then please take a look at noiseprotocol.org.

89
0:07:13.240 --> 0:07:20.800
That's very important also for other overlay networks you might heard of.

90
0:07:20.800 --> 0:07:29.040
The developer team of I2P has borrowed quite some things from WireGuard, VPN and also from

91
0:07:29.040 --> 0:07:36.840
Quick and there are some RFCs around so please dig deeper by using these hints.

92
0:07:36.840 --> 0:07:42.160
Then the cryptography had to be updated too.

93
0:07:42.160 --> 0:07:47.560
There will be more work coming in the upcoming years I know for sure.

94
0:07:47.560 --> 0:07:50.320
But it's now already on a quite good state.

95
0:07:50.320 --> 0:07:52.600
Right, seven minutes to go.

96
0:07:52.600 --> 0:07:54.960
What were the goals?

97
0:07:54.960 --> 0:08:05.720
UDP, the performance, is simply much better in an overlay network than TCP.

98
0:08:05.720 --> 0:08:13.800
Me as an application developer which is creating a fully distributed storage layer on top of

99
0:08:13.800 --> 0:08:21.520
the I2P network, performance to communicate between the notes in the peer-to-peer network

100
0:08:21.520 --> 0:08:23.480
is an issue.

101
0:08:23.480 --> 0:08:32.080
For me it was always the choice to take UDP and I implemented a gossiping protocol to

102
0:08:32.080 --> 0:08:36.760
realize this fully anonymous blockchain.

103
0:08:36.760 --> 0:08:39.000
This distributed storage layer.

104
0:08:39.000 --> 0:08:44.360
I needed UDP so that the peers could communicate within each other.

105
0:08:44.360 --> 0:08:50.960
For me this was really an important goal that they could improve the performance a lot.

106
0:08:50.960 --> 0:08:56.720
Additionally, as you know, there are countries in this world where communication is not that

107
0:08:56.720 --> 0:09:00.640
easy as we have the luck to be here in Europe.

108
0:09:00.640 --> 0:09:03.760
So obfuscation is a topic.

109
0:09:03.760 --> 0:09:09.040
For all those people, for all the whistleblowers and the journalists which are using I2P in

110
0:09:09.040 --> 0:09:13.040
critical countries, they must not be detected.

111
0:09:13.040 --> 0:09:20.120
And I2P is one of the premier solutions for such people which need communication on a

112
0:09:20.120 --> 0:09:23.840
very confidential level.

113
0:09:23.840 --> 0:09:34.880
The obfuscation was a big topic and additionally UDP is easily attackable so the developers

114
0:09:34.880 --> 0:09:37.760
had to look into the security problems they had.

115
0:09:37.760 --> 0:09:46.520
And they did a good job.

116
0:09:46.520 --> 0:09:50.960
There are a few other challenges of UDP like the fragmentation of messages.

117
0:09:50.960 --> 0:09:54.920
You have a long message, you want to send it through the network but it gets chopped

118
0:09:54.920 --> 0:10:01.760
up into pieces and UDP is not reliable so the developers really had some challenges

119
0:10:01.760 --> 0:10:04.600
to solve in the last 12 months.

120
0:10:04.600 --> 0:10:12.000
But the fact is they have implemented strong solutions and today if you look at the release

121
0:10:12.000 --> 0:10:20.480
notes of I2P, I2P is in a much better state.

122
0:10:20.480 --> 0:10:28.320
And this is what I want you as a core take out of this presentation.

123
0:10:28.320 --> 0:10:37.120
I2P gives users 20 years real privacy by design and the developers did a good job the last

124
0:10:37.120 --> 0:10:38.120
20 years.

125
0:10:38.120 --> 0:10:46.280
But now with this performance improvement and that's my personal view on their work,

126
0:10:46.280 --> 0:10:49.280
they really made a major step forward.

127
0:10:49.280 --> 0:10:55.760
Because UDP is for application developers really important within the I2P network.

128
0:10:55.760 --> 0:10:57.840
That's my personal view on it.

129
0:10:57.840 --> 0:11:03.240
Please feel free to criticize me afterwards in the Q&A session outside if you see this

130
0:11:03.240 --> 0:11:08.160
differently or if you have a different view on it, I'm happy to hear that.

131
0:11:08.160 --> 0:11:16.360
But these reductions, they are relevant.

132
0:11:16.360 --> 0:11:23.280
For us as application developers we directly felt this performance impact.

133
0:11:23.280 --> 0:11:28.800
In November when the release was, so four months ago or three and a half months ago,

134
0:11:28.800 --> 0:11:35.120
the performance in our blockchain test network improved very much.

135
0:11:35.120 --> 0:11:41.640
And although I believe from research point of view we have quite some work ahead of us

136
0:11:41.640 --> 0:11:49.720
to skeptically and very critically looking at the latest changes to see whether some

137
0:11:49.720 --> 0:11:56.880
weird box have been introduced, the first impression of the two months is woohoo, that's

138
0:11:56.880 --> 0:11:58.640
a new generation of I2P.

139
0:11:58.640 --> 0:12:03.800
So for me the performance impact is really, really relevant.

140
0:12:03.800 --> 0:12:11.160
Okay, we're on the target, we're seeing the target line.

141
0:12:11.160 --> 0:12:13.360
Takeouts.

142
0:12:13.360 --> 0:12:23.080
After 20 years of development I2P is the leading peer to peer privacy by design network which

143
0:12:23.080 --> 0:12:29.040
is a transport layer only which gives you today very modern cryptography, very modern

144
0:12:29.040 --> 0:12:36.160
possibilities to use as an application developer.

145
0:12:36.160 --> 0:12:51.560
The performance increased significantly since last November and if you feel as a researcher

146
0:12:51.560 --> 0:12:57.800
too or as an application developer to take a closer look at I2P I believe now it's a

147
0:12:57.800 --> 0:12:58.800
good time.

148
0:12:58.800 --> 0:13:05.080
Either you can invest as a researcher trying to break the anonymity and present it at

149
0:13:05.080 --> 0:13:11.200
an upcoming conference or you try to create some applications on top of it.

150
0:13:11.200 --> 0:13:18.000
I believe currently it's a good point to take a look again at I2P because now it's really

151
0:13:18.000 --> 0:13:22.080
quite fast to use and it's also fun to use.

152
0:13:22.080 --> 0:13:27.120
On GitHub, so that's in the lower right corner and you'll find it online on GitHub, you'll

153
0:13:27.120 --> 0:13:34.760
find Docker images which help you to get started with I2P really quickly.

154
0:13:34.760 --> 0:13:39.280
Because a peer to peer network to create it as a test network is quite complex but we

155
0:13:39.280 --> 0:13:44.680
created here simple images for you which you can start with Docker Compose, you have all

156
0:13:44.680 --> 0:13:50.280
the containers running and tada, you're a member of the I2P network and you can write

157
0:13:50.280 --> 0:13:57.280
your application on top of this network.

158
0:13:57.280 --> 0:14:00.240
Here is a list of sources.

159
0:14:00.240 --> 0:14:11.200
Please do your own research too because privacy by design also means that we hope to motivate

160
0:14:11.200 --> 0:14:17.760
US developers to take a look, a very close look at the documentation, a very close look

161
0:14:17.760 --> 0:14:25.720
at the source code to be sceptical because privacy is such an important topic for us

162
0:14:25.720 --> 0:14:26.720
as developers.

163
0:14:26.720 --> 0:14:33.720
So we're always very, very pleased if we get critical feedbacks on the development of the

164
0:14:33.720 --> 0:14:37.040
stuff we're doing.

165
0:14:37.040 --> 0:14:39.960
Thank you very much for your time.

166
0:14:39.960 --> 0:14:41.800
Have a great Fostem.

167
0:14:41.800 --> 0:14:42.800
Thank you.

168
0:14:42.800 --> 0:14:43.800
Thanks, Corin.

169
0:14:43.800 --> 0:14:44.800
Really nice talk.

170
0:14:44.800 --> 0:14:56.040
Again, if you have questions, please grab them outside and I'd be happy to answer.

171
0:14:56.040 --> 0:14:58.720
