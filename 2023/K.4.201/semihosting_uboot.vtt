00:00.000 --> 00:07.160
Hi, I'm Sean.

00:07.160 --> 00:12.960
Today I'm going to talk about semi-hosting in the context of U-Boot and what it is and

00:12.960 --> 00:17.280
how it works and maybe why you might want to use it.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.120
So first I want to ask how do you bootstrap a system?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.280
So you might do this for two reasons.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.800
One, you have a new board right from the factory and it has nothing on it at all and you have

00:27.800 --> 00:29.640
to get something on it.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.400
And the other one is maybe you bricked it and this happens to me sometimes, actually

00:33.400 --> 00:41.080
happens quite a lot, especially when I'm working on U-Boot and the board will no longer boot.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.760
So there's two basic steps usually.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.560
The first one is you want to get something running on your board and the second one is

00:48.560 --> 00:53.420
you want to then write something to storage so you don't have to do the process again.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.960
So there's a variety of protocols you can use.

00:55.960 --> 01:03.000
USB, of course, I like UMS, it's very nice, it makes your device look like a USB flash

01:03.000 --> 01:06.560
drive which is very, very convenient.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.480
There's also a bunch of Ethernet stuff, the classic TFTP.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.200
Fast Boot makes an appearance twice because it can do both.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.640
If you have an SD card, bootstrapping is super easy, you just pop out the SD card and put

01:18.640 --> 01:21.040
whatever you want on it and put the SD card back in.

01:21.040 --> 01:26.600
But a lot of boards don't have SD cards, so this is not always an option.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.960
There's serial.

01:27.960 --> 01:32.320
This is usually kind of slow, so you might only want to use it for the code execution

01:32.320 --> 01:34.720
part but it's definitely there.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.700
Some boards have it built into the bootloader, you can just flash something over serial.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.860
And there's also JTAG.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.640
And JTAG is kind of a classic one.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.700
Also slow, you probably wouldn't want to flash your whole root file system over it but it's

01:48.700 --> 01:53.720
pretty reliable and a lot of boards have it.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.980
What if you only have JTAG and you don't have any of these other nice protocols?

01:58.980 --> 02:05.400
So I'd like to take a little bit of a different approach to the problem and let's talk about

02:05.400 --> 02:11.320
something totally different which is the NXP Core IQ line of communications processors.

02:11.320 --> 02:20.840
These are the newest iterations of a very old line which stretches to the M68K and there's

02:20.840 --> 02:24.740
a very long lineage of power PC stuff in there.

02:24.740 --> 02:31.300
And they tend to have lots of Ethernet, some PCIe, some USB, but not any display interfaces,

02:31.300 --> 02:34.000
so they're not really media socks.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.180
And they often have hardware accelerated networking.

02:37.180 --> 02:41.400
So you can do some stuff in hardware which you would normally do in software.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.220
And this is kind of the main selling point on why you might want to use these.

02:46.220 --> 02:51.440
So all of these have something they call a reset configuration word or RCW.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.520
And this started back in the power PC days as just basic initialization.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.880
What NDS ministry sock is going to be, maybe what dividers you're going to have on some

03:00.880 --> 03:05.460
clocks, how wide your boot bus is, what are you going to do with your debug pins.

03:05.460 --> 03:11.240
This is kind of a small amount of data so they stuck it on some pull ups and pull downs

03:11.240 --> 03:12.240
on some of the pins.

03:12.240 --> 03:18.160
And this is a very standard thing you'll see on a lot of different socks.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.880
And then they wanted some pin muxing because when they originally started with this, all

03:21.880 --> 03:26.720
the pins were fixed function and you can sell more chips if you can change the function

03:26.720 --> 03:32.520
of some of the pins so that you can use USB on one chip and maybe Ethernet on another.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.160
So they added some pin muxing and they added it to the RCW.

03:37.160 --> 03:41.120
And then they added a lot more pin muxing because the more pin muxing you have, the

03:41.120 --> 03:44.040
more applications your chip can fit into.

03:44.040 --> 03:49.640
And so they started running out of pins because they started getting maybe like 128, 256,

03:49.640 --> 03:54.920
512 bits of stuff that they needed to configure.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.220
And so they decided they were going to put the RCW on the boot device.

03:59.220 --> 04:04.000
So the first thing the sock does when it boots up is it reads off this RCW and it configures

04:04.000 --> 04:07.260
all the pins and then it continues with the boot.

04:07.260 --> 04:13.600
And this is kind of convenient but it creates a chicken and egg problem where in order for

04:13.600 --> 04:18.860
your sock to boot up there has to be something on your initial device.

04:18.860 --> 04:23.440
And if you're in a situation where you have to boot strap it, there's nothing there.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.420
So the sock won't boot up.

04:25.420 --> 04:30.040
So what they did is they created a hard coded reset configuration board.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.280
This is for maximum compatibility.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.260
They would disable all the peripherals and you would just have your boot device.

04:36.260 --> 04:40.940
And so you could always boot into this and be safe and not break your board.

04:40.940 --> 04:46.620
But this is not so great because they never added runtime pin muxing.

04:46.620 --> 04:51.380
So this chip you select a function for your pins and you can't change it.

04:51.380 --> 04:55.340
There are a few pins where you can change it but for the most of them you're stuck.

04:55.340 --> 05:00.060
So when you have this maximum compatibility RCW with everything disabled, you have no

05:00.060 --> 05:05.660
Ethernet, you have no USB, you have no serial even and all you get is JTAG and your boot

05:05.660 --> 05:07.440
device.

05:07.440 --> 05:15.300
So NXP knew they had a problem and they decided to solve it by introducing this override.

05:15.300 --> 05:20.300
So you would boot via the hard coded reset configuration board and then you would program

05:20.300 --> 05:24.300
via JTAG the values that you actually wanted that would enable all your peripherals for

05:24.300 --> 05:29.180
your board and then you would do a partial reset and it would come up and it would load

05:29.180 --> 05:31.060
everything like it was supposed to.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.620
But there's a couple problems with this.

05:33.620 --> 05:39.380
The main one is that they never documented this stuff so in order to use it you have

05:39.380 --> 05:46.600
to use the JTAG probe which is like most JTAG probes kind of a gouge because they know you're

05:46.600 --> 05:50.380
buying the chips so you got to have the JTAG probe and you have to use their IDE which

05:50.380 --> 05:54.860
is a yearly subscription and they're not cheap.

05:54.860 --> 06:00.220
So this is not a great situation and if you didn't think this was great, here's a glowing

06:00.220 --> 06:02.140
review I found on the forums.

06:02.140 --> 06:06.060
Our manufacturer uses a single PC to perform the initial programming.

06:06.060 --> 06:10.420
On this PC they have an evaluation copy of CodeWarrior which is their IDE.

06:10.420 --> 06:14.620
Every time that evaluation copy expires they erase the hard drive of the PC, install the

06:14.620 --> 06:18.420
OS again and load another evaluation copy.

06:18.420 --> 06:26.260
So this is not ideal and I thought about how I might address this and make it better and

06:26.260 --> 06:30.900
I remembered something that I had learned about a couple months ago which is called

06:30.900 --> 06:35.960
semi-hosting and the basic idea of semi-hosting is that you attach a debugger, in my case

06:35.960 --> 06:41.980
it's over JTAG and your code is going to execute a special breakpoint instruction and

06:41.980 --> 06:47.460
when your debugger sees this it will read out their an opcode in R0 and an argument

06:47.460 --> 06:51.740
in R1 and it will do something for you and then it will give you a return code back in

06:51.740 --> 06:53.540
R0.

06:53.540 --> 06:58.300
And this is very very similar to how sys calls work because your program will execute a special

06:58.300 --> 07:02.980
instruction, the operating system will read out your registers, it will do something for

07:02.980 --> 07:06.860
you and give you a return code.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.860
So what do you get?

07:07.860 --> 07:11.980
Well the thing that I wanted most is serial because I didn't have any.

07:11.980 --> 07:19.180
So first I looked at some of the sys write C and sys write C is basically put char.

07:19.180 --> 07:23.460
So we can implement put S here and so we're going to take in a string and we're going

07:23.460 --> 07:28.140
to loop over all the characters in the string and for each character we're going to trap

07:28.140 --> 07:33.340
or execute our breakpoint instruction and we're going to pass for our opcode write C

07:33.340 --> 07:39.100
and we're also going to pass a pointer to the character and if you may know that put

07:39.100 --> 07:45.900
char actually just takes the character and so this is kind of an unfortunate performance

07:45.900 --> 07:50.780
implication because we have one breakpoint and one memory access per character in the

07:50.780 --> 07:56.480
string and for JTAG this is not very performant.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.320
If you've ever used a 300 baud modem you know that it's very slow.

08:00.320 --> 08:05.060
This is even slower so this is really not useful if you actually want to use your serial

08:05.060 --> 08:06.580
output.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.500
So we can do better though.

08:08.500 --> 08:13.820
They also have something called sys write zero and this is basically put S. So our PIDUS

08:13.820 --> 08:16.260
implementation gets very simple.

08:16.260 --> 08:22.740
We're just going to trap with write zero and now we get one breakpoint per string but we

08:22.740 --> 08:27.740
still have to do one memory access per character and the problem is that we don't want to read

08:27.740 --> 08:28.900
off the end of the string.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.540
We have to make sure that we don't go past the null terminator.

08:31.540 --> 08:36.340
So the debugger has to read a character and then see is it the null terminator and if

08:36.340 --> 08:40.260
it's not you read another character and you keep doing this and we really don't want to

08:40.260 --> 08:42.380
go off the end.

08:42.380 --> 08:47.580
But the problem is that for JTAG setting up a read is a pretty intensive process.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.460
There's a lot of overhead and it can be still pretty slow.

08:51.460 --> 08:56.860
So this is faster, about ten times as fast but it's still slow.

08:56.860 --> 08:58.300
Really not usable.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.700
But we can do even better.

09:00.700 --> 09:06.300
So we're going to use sys write which is basically the write system call and for this

09:06.300 --> 09:10.740
one because we have multiple parameters, the previous ones only had one parameter so it

09:10.740 --> 09:12.060
just goes in the argument.

09:12.060 --> 09:16.380
But for this one we're going to fill in our arguments inside of a struct and we're going

09:16.380 --> 09:21.020
to take the file descriptor and the buffer and the length of the buffer and we're going

09:21.020 --> 09:27.020
to fill this in with standard out and our string and the length of our string and then

09:27.020 --> 09:32.120
we're going to trap and we're going to pass a pointer to our struct and this is generally

09:32.120 --> 09:38.620
how we pass multiple arguments to semi-hosting because there's only one argument register

09:38.620 --> 09:41.580
so they will take a pointer to the struct.

09:41.580 --> 09:46.460
And so now we get one breakpoint per string and two memory accesses per string and this

09:46.460 --> 09:48.500
is reasonably fast.

09:48.500 --> 09:53.200
We can do stuff with this and it's not glacially slow.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.620
So this is the kind of implementation I ended up using it.

09:56.620 --> 10:00.840
And if you've been paying attention you'll note that sys write kind of implies the existence

10:00.840 --> 10:08.540
of sys open and you can open any file on your host system which is pretty convenient and

10:08.540 --> 10:13.840
you can do all the standard stuff like seeking it and reading it and closing it.

10:13.840 --> 10:19.320
We don't get stat but we do get the file length which is mostly what we want because usually

10:19.320 --> 10:24.780
we just want to open it, find out how long it is and then read the whole thing.

10:24.780 --> 10:28.420
So in U-Boot you may classically do something like this.

10:28.420 --> 10:32.340
If you want to load your Linux and then boot it, you're going to load it from MMC0, add

10:32.340 --> 10:35.580
a particular address and then you're going to give it a file name and then you'll boot

10:35.580 --> 10:37.820
it.

10:37.820 --> 10:45.140
And so we can replace this with load hostfs which is the something on your host debugger

10:45.140 --> 10:50.180
file system and that Linux image will get read from the directory that you're running

10:50.180 --> 10:52.600
your debugger from.

10:52.600 --> 10:59.300
And it's the same structure because under the hood it's using the same API.

10:59.300 --> 11:04.760
And there's a dash because there's only one hostfs and we don't need to have multiple

11:04.760 --> 11:07.220
debugger support.

11:07.220 --> 11:12.020
And there's a special file called colon TT which I think stands for teletype and this

11:12.020 --> 11:14.020
is your standard in and standard out.

11:14.020 --> 11:19.340
And almost everybody uses this except QMU because QMU doesn't have this huge overhead

11:19.340 --> 11:24.740
for memory accesses so they don't actually care if you can use your console with read

11:24.740 --> 11:32.940
and write and so you just use write zero with them and it works.

11:32.940 --> 11:38.660
So one classic problem with booting with JTAG is that your regular boot process is going

11:38.660 --> 11:43.820
to look something like load SPL and SPL is going to initialize DRAM and then SPL is going

11:43.820 --> 11:48.060
to load regular U-Boot into DRAM and execute it.

11:48.060 --> 11:53.140
And when you do this with JTAG instead you have to load SPL over JTAG and JTAG is going

11:53.140 --> 12:03.560
to run and initialize DRAM and sometime you have to load U-Boot into DRAM over JTAG.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.360
But we don't really know when.

12:06.360 --> 12:12.860
And so a really classic way to do this is you just pick a time and you wait that long

12:12.860 --> 12:14.940
and then you load U-Boot.

12:14.940 --> 12:19.940
But this is kind of awful because if you have any kind of variance in how long DRAM initialization

12:19.940 --> 12:25.220
takes or how long it takes, especially if you're doing other hardware initialization,

12:25.220 --> 12:29.380
you have to just wait a lot longer and in the average case you're going to be doing

12:29.380 --> 12:30.380
nothing.

12:30.380 --> 12:34.100
And this can really drive you nuts as a developer because you might be waiting like 20 seconds

12:34.100 --> 12:39.740
because sometimes it takes 20 seconds but most of the time it doesn't.

12:39.740 --> 12:46.980
So you can also re-implement DRAM in TCL and this is a really common thing for vendors

12:46.980 --> 12:50.280
to do because they love just, you know, it's very simple for them.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.960
They just write all the registers and it happens over JTAG.

12:53.960 --> 12:59.540
And this avoids the whole timing problem because we know exactly when DRAM has been initialized.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.620
But it's a totally different process from normal.

13:01.620 --> 13:05.740
You have to specify your parameters in a different format, in a different language.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.620
It's not going to be tested as much and it probably won't initialize things in the same

13:09.620 --> 13:10.620
way.

13:10.620 --> 13:17.780
So it can be more buggy and it's kind of worrisome, especially when you have to, your regular

13:17.780 --> 13:21.600
U-Boot will work fine and maybe this doesn't work so well.

13:21.600 --> 13:27.780
But semi-hosting makes this really simple because SPL can load and then it will, over

13:27.780 --> 13:32.980
JTAG, initialize DRAM and it says to your host, please load U-Boot at this address and

13:32.980 --> 13:36.740
your host will do that and then it continues on its way.

13:36.740 --> 13:42.100
And it's extremely simple to use and it solves this whole timing problem, which can be very

13:42.100 --> 13:43.820
annoying.

13:43.820 --> 13:44.820
So what else do you get?

13:44.820 --> 13:46.980
Well, we get some error handling.

13:46.980 --> 13:51.260
Error know is practically essential to find out why something failed.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.940
Is error is not.

13:52.940 --> 13:57.060
The idea of is error is that you will pass in a return code and is error will tell you

13:57.060 --> 13:59.020
if it's an error or not.

13:59.020 --> 14:04.100
But the problem is that some of these semi-hosting commands have different semantics for the return

14:04.100 --> 14:05.100
code.

14:05.100 --> 14:09.020
But most of the time, the semantic is negative numbers are errors.

14:09.020 --> 14:15.380
So effectively, you're doing this whole big semi-hosting call just to compare to zero.

14:15.380 --> 14:16.980
So I don't really know why this is in here.

14:16.980 --> 14:20.600
And there's actually several functions that are kind of like that.

14:20.600 --> 14:27.180
For example, sys time will get you the real time, which can be helpful if your device

14:27.180 --> 14:30.580
doesn't have an RTC or you don't want to initialize it.

14:30.580 --> 14:34.520
But sys elapsed will get you the number of ticks that your program has been running.

14:34.520 --> 14:38.000
So maybe you would use this for benchmarking.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.180
But the overhead of doing semi-hosting is a lot larger than the amount of precision

14:45.180 --> 14:46.180
that you're going to get.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.340
So I'm not really sure why you use that one either.

14:49.340 --> 14:51.000
There's some libc emulation.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.860
You can pass it in a command line.

14:52.860 --> 14:55.860
U-Boot, we don't really need this because we have the environment and we have the device

14:55.860 --> 14:56.860
tree.

14:56.860 --> 14:59.820
And those are kind of classic ways to pass in parameters.

14:59.820 --> 15:04.860
But if you're not using U-Boot and you don't have this sort of system set up, you can get

15:04.860 --> 15:07.140
command line parameters pretty easily.

15:07.140 --> 15:11.580
There's also assist heap, which is where you tell the device where it thinks the heap is

15:11.580 --> 15:14.400
and where it should malloc stuff.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.500
But usually you know this when you compile.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.700
You say this address range is going to be where I'm going to stick my heap.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.020
So also I'm not really sure why that's in there.

15:23.020 --> 15:28.020
And as you may have noticed, you can write files.

15:28.020 --> 15:32.900
So of course you can mess things up, especially on Unix, where you can open up a lot of files

15:32.900 --> 15:35.900
that aren't really files and do some fun stuff with them.

15:35.900 --> 15:40.120
But you can also just run arbitrary commands and you can remove files too.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.220
So you have to really trust this stuff that you're going to run.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.380
Because as far as I know, no one does sandboxing.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.140
They just implement all this stuff.

15:49.140 --> 15:54.120
So maybe they shouldn't, but that's how it is.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.860
So if you've ever used semi-hosting before, you may be familiar with this problem.

15:58.860 --> 16:03.220
Breakpoints are actually invalid instructions and your program will crash unless there is

16:03.220 --> 16:07.180
a debugger attached and the debugger will handle it for you and you won't end up executing

16:07.180 --> 16:08.980
it.

16:08.980 --> 16:11.640
So typically you would have to have two programs.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.180
One with semi-hosting enabled and one with semi-hosting not enabled.

16:15.180 --> 16:18.740
And the one with semi-hosting enabled you'd have to run with a debugger.

16:18.740 --> 16:22.860
But we can get around this using a pretty simple trick.

16:22.860 --> 16:25.980
This one is from Tom Verbuehr.

16:25.980 --> 16:32.020
And the idea is that in your synchronous support handler, you first check to make sure that

16:32.020 --> 16:36.160
we have an invalid instruction and otherwise you panic which probably involves printing

16:36.160 --> 16:43.580
out the registers or doing something complaining loudly on the serial which you might not have.

16:43.580 --> 16:49.220
Then you would do, we need to check to make sure our instruction which is held in ELR

16:49.220 --> 16:56.700
is the semi-hosting ARM64 HALT instruction which is the special breakpoint.

16:56.700 --> 17:04.260
And the lower bits of the PC are actually not the PC on ARM because they have stuff

17:04.260 --> 17:06.700
like are you in thumb mode or not.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.620
So we need to mask those off.

17:08.620 --> 17:13.420
You could probably just do and tilde 3.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.900
And if we actually find out that it wasn't supposed to be a semi-hosting instruction,

17:16.900 --> 17:20.540
we're going to disable semi-hosting which on your processor can do whatever it wants

17:20.540 --> 17:24.100
but on U-Boot it just sets a global variable that says we don't have semi-hosting, don't

17:24.100 --> 17:25.700
try it again.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.340
And then we pretend that we get a failure.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.740
Negative one is almost always a failure.

17:30.740 --> 17:35.940
And then we advance the PC by 4 bytes.

17:35.940 --> 17:40.500
So if you want to use semi-hosting in U-Boot, you can enable these configs.

17:40.500 --> 17:47.180
The first one enables semi-hosting of any kind and also enables this command.

17:47.180 --> 17:51.020
The second one, semi-hosting serial, will get you some serial input and output.

17:51.020 --> 17:55.360
And you'll probably want this serial put s because normally U-Boot will print a character

17:55.360 --> 18:02.180
at a time and put s will group those characters into strings and print them all at once.

18:02.180 --> 18:07.500
And if you want to have this thing, you will need to enable config semi-hosting fallback.

18:07.500 --> 18:11.260
And if you want to use it in SPL, then you can enable the SPL versions.

18:11.260 --> 18:16.220
There's no serial version because U-Boot always enables the serial device in SPL that it's

18:16.220 --> 18:19.420
using in the regular U-Boot.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.980
And these are the things that I worked on adding.

18:21.980 --> 18:27.580
And I also worked on config semi-hosting a lot but the basic support was already there.

18:27.580 --> 18:31.580
There's also RISC-V support from Kautok console.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.860
And this is pretty recently added so it's either in the January release or maybe the

18:35.860 --> 18:38.580
March release, I'm not sure.

18:38.580 --> 18:43.100
And if you want to know more about how to enable this, we have a documentation link.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.380
And of course you're also going to need a debugger.

18:46.380 --> 18:52.780
So I like to use OpenOCD, maybe because I'm a masochist.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.900
And OpenOCD is a debug server for JTAG.

18:55.900 --> 19:02.560
So the idea is you launch OpenOCD and it connects to your debug probe and then you can tell

19:02.560 --> 19:07.420
the debug probe to do things like start or stop your processor and you can also attach

19:07.420 --> 19:10.580
the GDB to it like it's a running process.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.980
So this is pretty simple for OpenOCD.

19:12.980 --> 19:16.980
You just halt the processor, you enable semi-hosting and then you resume it.

19:16.980 --> 19:21.140
And typically what you would do is in between this enabling semi-hosting and resuming, you

19:21.140 --> 19:24.660
would load your program and then resume at a particular address.

19:24.660 --> 19:30.700
And this you could stick in a script and just run and automate the whole thing.

19:30.700 --> 19:35.180
So there's a couple of downsides to OpenOCD.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.900
You can kind of think of this as like a wish list or things that annoy me but not enough

19:38.900 --> 19:41.580
that I fix them.

19:41.580 --> 19:46.460
The one of them is that it uses the same terminal for regular logging messages like I attached

19:46.460 --> 19:50.780
to the debugger and that sort of thing as semi-hosting output so they can be kind of

19:50.780 --> 19:51.780
get intermixed.

19:51.780 --> 19:54.580
So you have to watch out for that.

19:54.580 --> 19:59.340
The serial is cooked, which means that when you type something, nothing happens until

19:59.340 --> 20:02.700
you hit enter and then everything happens.

20:02.700 --> 20:09.100
And this is kind of okay because if you're editing a command line, it's generally really

20:09.100 --> 20:14.580
slow if you hit backspace and then you have to go to U-Boot and U-Boot interprets the

20:14.580 --> 20:18.620
backspace and echoes it back and then it gets displayed on your terminal.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.380
So cooked is nice here.

20:20.380 --> 20:25.740
The problem is that OpenOCD is single-threaded so while it's waiting for you to input, it's

20:25.740 --> 20:26.900
not doing anything.

20:26.900 --> 20:32.060
So if you unplug the device or you hit control C in your debugger, it won't notice until

20:32.060 --> 20:33.860
you hit enter.

20:33.860 --> 20:41.060
So this can be kind of fun especially because even if you know about it, you might forget.

20:41.060 --> 20:44.940
And this single-threaded thing also ties into there's no sandboxing.

20:44.940 --> 20:49.380
So ideally you would do something like fork off another process and maybe unshare some

20:49.380 --> 20:54.880
stuff or put it in a CH root and then that would be where you would run all your semi-hosting

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
stuff.

20:55.880 --> 21:00.700
You could run the file and you could limit it to just a few files but there's no sandboxing.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.060
So your whole system is there.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.980
Once again, you have to trust your stuff.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.420
So should you use semi-hosting?

21:07.420 --> 21:11.960
I would say not unless you have to, especially not the serial stuff.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.240
But it's good to have.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.620
If you have to use it, it's nice.

21:16.620 --> 21:17.780
And sometimes it's convenient.

21:17.780 --> 21:21.740
If you're doing emulation, it can be really simple because you don't have to emulate an

21:21.740 --> 21:22.740
MMC device.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.600
You don't have to write a driver for an MMC device.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.220
You just call your semi-hosting instruction and you can load the file right into where

21:29.220 --> 21:30.220
you want it.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.780
And you don't have to do any hardware.

21:32.780 --> 21:36.780
And if you're already using JTAG boot, this can be really nice to solve some of your sequencing

21:36.780 --> 21:38.380
stuff.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.300
But I wouldn't recommend it in general.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.660
So I'd like to thank a couple people.

21:43.660 --> 21:48.740
Tom Verbuheir wrote a blog post on this stuff that got me thinking about the whole thing.

21:48.740 --> 21:55.160
Andre Pshivara did the initial semi-hosting and he also worked with me when I was upstreaming

21:55.160 --> 21:57.180
my stuff, so I'm grateful for that.

21:57.180 --> 22:02.220
And of course, Tom Reaney and Simon Glass, who reviewed and merged all of this code and

22:02.220 --> 22:04.780
a lot of other patches along the years.

22:04.780 --> 22:07.380
And of course Merrick, who put me up to this talk.

22:07.380 --> 22:11.480
And Seiko, who employed me while I was writing the code.

22:11.480 --> 22:15.820
And if you're interested in this, there's that blog post I was talking about.

22:15.820 --> 22:21.180
There is the RISC-V software spec, which is just the ARM software spec, but they use a

22:21.180 --> 22:23.880
different instruction and different registers.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.440
And of course the ARM software spec.

22:25.440 --> 22:32.220
And this link may die because ARM has a tendency to rearrange things, but for now it works.

22:32.220 --> 22:35.220
Thank you.

22:35.220 --> 22:46.300
Does anyone have a question?

22:46.300 --> 22:47.300
Questions?

22:47.300 --> 22:54.780
Yes, I do.

22:54.780 --> 22:55.780
Can you actually use semi-hosting for serial bundle in Linux?

22:55.780 --> 23:00.700
Yes, but only for debug prints and I haven't looked into it that closely.

23:00.700 --> 23:06.660
I think the whole stopping Linux to do a breakpoint is kind of invasive because Linux tends

23:06.660 --> 23:11.500
not to like that because your interrupts for that core will just not happen while it's

23:11.500 --> 23:13.260
stuck on the debugger.

23:13.260 --> 23:16.980
And you can kind of break your devices that expect there to be an interrupt that gets

23:16.980 --> 23:19.840
handled in a reasonable manner.

23:19.840 --> 23:26.640
So typically when you stop the processor in Linux, like your EMMC will just break.

23:26.640 --> 23:31.260
So generally I've only seen it for debug prints and usually only if like you can't get to

23:31.260 --> 23:33.260
the real serial console.

23:33.260 --> 23:52.060
Yeah.

23:52.060 --> 23:57.460
Okay since we have a couple minutes I have a one more slide.

23:57.460 --> 24:03.460
So normally when you will print something this is what it gets, it'll get like hello

24:03.460 --> 24:08.700
and it'll normally print this like H E L L O slash R slash N and it inserts the slash

24:08.700 --> 24:11.220
R and it'll do it one character at a time.

24:11.220 --> 24:16.000
But as we've established earlier this is gleefully slow on semi-hosted hardware.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.540
So what I initially did was this and I printed out hello slash N and then I added the dash

24:21.540 --> 24:27.420
slash R. But this will actually break things because they expect it to be R N and not

24:27.420 --> 24:31.420
N R even though like functionally they're the same.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.400
So I ended up having to do it the other way.

24:34.400 --> 24:39.580
So if you ever implement this stuff be aware of that.

24:39.580 --> 24:45.400
Although if you are doing this like on a microcontroller you can probably just put hello R N in your

24:45.400 --> 24:59.180
strings and maybe that's better.
