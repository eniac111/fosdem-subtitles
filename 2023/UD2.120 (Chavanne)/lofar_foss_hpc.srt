1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:17.880
We are ready for the next talk by Courtney, who is going to talk about open source radio

2
0:00:17.880 --> 0:00:18.880
astronomy.

3
0:00:18.880 --> 0:00:19.880
Hi, everyone.

4
0:00:19.880 --> 0:00:25.600
I work for Ostrone, which is the Dutch Institute for Radio Astronomy.

5
0:00:25.600 --> 0:00:30.440
We are a government institute, so we are publicly funded.

6
0:00:30.440 --> 0:00:34.600
Apart from being publicly funded, we have a lot of research grants, and that's basically

7
0:00:34.600 --> 0:00:36.600
what pays my salary.

8
0:00:36.600 --> 0:00:42.040
I'm going to talk about our biggest instrument that we have, which is called LOFAR, and we

9
0:00:42.040 --> 0:00:46.120
actually utilize a lot of open source software there, almost exclusively.

10
0:00:46.120 --> 0:00:48.000
There are some caveats.

11
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:49.320
My name is Courtney Luecker, by the way.

12
0:00:49.320 --> 0:00:51.720
I am also into amateur radio.

13
0:00:51.720 --> 0:00:54.840
My call sign is Papa Delta 3 Sierra Uniform.

14
0:00:54.840 --> 0:00:56.600
This is going to be quite a relaxed talk.

15
0:00:56.600 --> 0:01:00.920
We're going to give a high-level overview of all the different components that are there.

16
0:01:00.920 --> 0:01:04.920
There's quite a lot of them, actually, so it's not possible to go into detail with the

17
0:01:04.920 --> 0:01:05.920
time we have.

18
0:01:05.920 --> 0:01:11.840
This is my first post-em talk ever, and also my first talk ever in a lecture hall, so that's

19
0:01:11.840 --> 0:01:13.720
quite interesting.

20
0:01:13.720 --> 0:01:15.760
Now, some background.

21
0:01:15.760 --> 0:01:18.440
I mentioned that we are a government institute.

22
0:01:18.440 --> 0:01:23.160
We firmly believe public money means public code, and we stand by that in almost everything

23
0:01:23.160 --> 0:01:25.040
we do already.

24
0:01:25.040 --> 0:01:29.120
We have an open source committee that also ensures that we do that, and we have basically

25
0:01:29.120 --> 0:01:30.840
two very big telescopes.

26
0:01:30.840 --> 0:01:36.160
One's called LOFAR, which stands for low frequency array, and the other is the Westerbork Synthetist

27
0:01:36.160 --> 0:01:39.440
Telescope, also called WSRT.

28
0:01:39.440 --> 0:01:45.000
There's some sister institutes that we work closely with or are related to us.

29
0:01:45.000 --> 0:01:50.520
One is called COMRAS, which maintains a telescope that we've stopped using, and the others are

30
0:01:50.520 --> 0:01:51.640
JIVE and EVN.

31
0:01:51.640 --> 0:01:54.760
I'm not going to talk too much about those today.

32
0:01:54.760 --> 0:01:59.640
What I want to show you is that there is this principle that our radio telescopes work on

33
0:01:59.640 --> 0:02:05.720
that is called very long baseline interferometry, and this enables us to do radio astronomy

34
0:02:05.720 --> 0:02:11.560
in a way that wasn't possible with traditional radio telescopes.

35
0:02:11.560 --> 0:02:13.160
This is the whole map of LOFAR.

36
0:02:13.160 --> 0:02:15.920
There's 54 stations in total.

37
0:02:15.920 --> 0:02:18.880
Roughly 25 of those are located in the Netherlands.

38
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:24.320
I say it's around 2,000 kilometres in diameter, but that's no longer true because the one

39
0:02:24.320 --> 0:02:30.000
in Rosen is new and we're now about 2,500 kilometres in diameter.

40
0:02:30.000 --> 0:02:35.480
This diameter is also called the baseline, which is where the very long baseline interferometry

41
0:02:35.480 --> 0:02:36.480
comes from.

42
0:02:36.480 --> 0:02:43.200
If we then zoom into a station, you see all these tiles, and you see these little squares.

43
0:02:43.200 --> 0:02:50.040
Those are the different types of antenna, and that is what makes this type of radio

44
0:02:50.040 --> 0:02:54.720
astronomy so interesting, is that we don't have a single antenna to catch radio waves.

45
0:02:54.720 --> 0:03:00.760
We have lots of them, about 20,000 in total, actually, which is quite substantial.

46
0:03:00.760 --> 0:03:07.240
This centre is called the SuperTurb, and it's located in Ex-Lode, the Netherlands.

47
0:03:07.240 --> 0:03:09.160
How can we actually combine this data?

48
0:03:09.160 --> 0:03:14.800
I told you that traditional radio astronomy relies on a parabolic dish or a single antenna,

49
0:03:14.800 --> 0:03:17.800
and we try to scale those up, make them bigger and bigger.

50
0:03:17.800 --> 0:03:20.360
Of course, physics are at the limits at some point.

51
0:03:20.360 --> 0:03:25.120
You can't make a structure from steel that's like 500 metres in diameter.

52
0:03:25.120 --> 0:03:33.440
What we do instead is we combine smaller antennas to act as if they are a parabolic antenna.

53
0:03:33.440 --> 0:03:38.120
The trick about a parabolic antenna is that all radio waves, no matter where they are

54
0:03:38.120 --> 0:03:42.600
incoming from, they all have an equal distance to the receiver.

55
0:03:42.600 --> 0:03:45.520
We need to emulate that with our antennas.

56
0:03:45.520 --> 0:03:47.400
We do that in two ways.

57
0:03:47.400 --> 0:03:52.920
There is an artificial delay, an analogue artificial delay, by just making the line

58
0:03:52.920 --> 0:03:57.960
that it needs to travel across on the PCB or the coax cable longer, but we can also

59
0:03:57.960 --> 0:04:01.920
do it digitally after the data is being sampled.

60
0:04:01.920 --> 0:04:07.440
Then we can aim into the sky and create a very narrow beam that observes a very small

61
0:04:07.440 --> 0:04:09.320
portion of the sky.

62
0:04:09.320 --> 0:04:16.520
That allows us to zoom really deep into space and make very detailed images.

63
0:04:16.520 --> 0:04:18.820
But what is this radio waves actually?

64
0:04:18.820 --> 0:04:19.820
What are those?

65
0:04:19.820 --> 0:04:20.820
What are we observing?

66
0:04:20.820 --> 0:04:25.760
There are two types of radio waves that are being emitted by objects in space and the

67
0:04:25.760 --> 0:04:26.760
galaxy.

68
0:04:26.760 --> 0:04:31.440
We're only going to describe one phenomena today that's called synchrotron radiation.

69
0:04:31.440 --> 0:04:36.680
Basically, if you have an ion, a charged particle, and you accelerate that, then it starts creating

70
0:04:36.680 --> 0:04:38.600
radio wave emissions.

71
0:04:38.600 --> 0:04:44.280
The frequency and the intensity at the frequency that is actually very dependent, that's all

72
0:04:44.280 --> 0:04:47.400
details that are not very interesting for this talk.

73
0:04:47.400 --> 0:04:52.440
But one of these entities that emit these types of charged particles are sometimes black

74
0:04:52.440 --> 0:04:53.440
holes.

75
0:04:53.440 --> 0:04:56.520
We'll see an example of that at the end.

76
0:04:56.520 --> 0:04:57.960
I mentioned black holes.

77
0:04:57.960 --> 0:05:01.040
There's other types of radio astronomy that are very interesting.

78
0:05:01.040 --> 0:05:06.360
We can also model our own ionosphere, so there's more enlightening.

79
0:05:06.360 --> 0:05:07.480
Stars are pretty interesting.

80
0:05:07.480 --> 0:05:11.080
These are stars that are rotating at a periodic interval.

81
0:05:11.080 --> 0:05:16.800
They have very strong radio waves coming from the poles of those stars.

82
0:05:16.800 --> 0:05:18.200
What does Loewe actually look like?

83
0:05:18.200 --> 0:05:20.640
It's a very small antenna, as I told you.

84
0:05:20.640 --> 0:05:25.200
We can see on the left that there's wires attached to those poles.

85
0:05:25.200 --> 0:05:27.420
Those are actually dipole antennas.

86
0:05:27.420 --> 0:05:31.800
If you configure them like this, where they are like a V shape, they are called inverted

87
0:05:31.800 --> 0:05:33.000
V's.

88
0:05:33.000 --> 0:05:35.160
These are the low band antennas.

89
0:05:35.160 --> 0:05:36.920
On the right side, you see the high band antennas.

90
0:05:36.920 --> 0:05:41.720
They're like a clover shape, like a tie shape.

91
0:05:41.720 --> 0:05:48.600
Then we combine all these low band antennas and 69 high band antennas in a station, and

92
0:05:48.600 --> 0:05:53.440
we send the data at around 3 gigabits per second to our HPC clusters.

93
0:05:53.440 --> 0:05:55.240
There's a two-phase cluster here.

94
0:05:55.240 --> 0:06:00.160
The first is GPU processing, where we do correlation and beamforming.

95
0:06:00.160 --> 0:06:06.480
The second is central processing, which is more like CPU based.

96
0:06:06.480 --> 0:06:11.440
In the early days, our computing cluster looked something like this.

97
0:06:11.440 --> 0:06:17.120
We had IBM BlueJeans machines, which were based on PowerPC, and they had a 3D Torus

98
0:06:17.120 --> 0:06:22.160
interconnect, which is actually quite interesting interconnect.

99
0:06:22.160 --> 0:06:27.240
This was problematic because utilizing the floating point vector extensions required

100
0:06:27.240 --> 0:06:31.920
manually rewriting assembly, which wasn't that nice and was pretty hard to find developers

101
0:06:31.920 --> 0:06:35.000
who were willing or capable to do that.

102
0:06:35.000 --> 0:06:46.960
We moved to commodity hardware, two CPUs per socket, two sockets per server, two GPUs per

103
0:06:46.960 --> 0:06:51.520
server, lots of networking.

104
0:06:51.520 --> 0:06:53.960
That is really what you see here.

105
0:06:53.960 --> 0:07:00.360
We had 32 gigabytes of 10 gigabit Ethernet, and then in 2018, when we upgraded, we had

106
0:07:00.360 --> 0:07:07.960
24 times or 23 times of 100 gigabits in FiniBand, but you also see that there's a lot of 10

107
0:07:07.960 --> 0:07:10.360
gigabit Ethernet per device.

108
0:07:10.360 --> 0:07:16.440
I'm going to go into that while it is in a minute.

109
0:07:16.440 --> 0:07:22.360
If you look at the data flow or more like a software site, then you see that the antennas

110
0:07:22.360 --> 0:07:28.800
have ADC, so these convert the analog waves that are incoming to digital signals, and

111
0:07:28.800 --> 0:07:35.840
then we do beamforming on the stations, and we send data to the correlator.

112
0:07:35.840 --> 0:07:43.000
This correlator also does the correlation afterwards.

113
0:07:43.000 --> 0:07:48.160
You can see that once the correlator is done with it, we store this to disk, and once it's

114
0:07:48.160 --> 0:07:52.880
stored on disk, then it's made available to the central processing.

115
0:07:52.880 --> 0:07:58.400
The correlator and our GPU cluster, Cobalt, are doing streaming, and the central processing

116
0:07:58.400 --> 0:08:02.720
is more like your traditional HPC.

117
0:08:02.720 --> 0:08:07.160
When we look at the data flow in Cobalt, there's all this incoming 10 gigabit Ethernet, and

118
0:08:07.160 --> 0:08:13.760
this is why we have four or three 10 gigabit Ethernet links per Cobalt server.

119
0:08:13.760 --> 0:08:19.120
They are streaming the data, and we configure a per station where it needs to send its data

120
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:20.120
to.

121
0:08:20.120 --> 0:08:28.520
Then, once it's there, it's being transposed at roughly 240 gigabits, and once it's transposed,

122
0:08:28.520 --> 0:08:32.340
we do have two pipelines that essentially run in parallel.

123
0:08:32.340 --> 0:08:35.680
One is correlation, and one is additional beamforming.

124
0:08:35.680 --> 0:08:38.280
We actually beamform twice in a sense.

125
0:08:38.280 --> 0:08:43.000
It's a little bit more complicated than I'm sketching here, but I'm keeping things simple

126
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:48.920
because stations also have the capability to not beamform and send un-beamform data.

127
0:08:48.920 --> 0:08:52.880
We have a special buffer that's called the transient buffer, where we dump raw samples

128
0:08:52.880 --> 0:09:00.160
and can send those two clusters, but the general pipeline is what I'm sketching here.

129
0:09:00.160 --> 0:09:05.760
If I zoom into these two pipelines, the correlator pipeline and the beamformer pipeline, I don't

130
0:09:05.760 --> 0:09:09.700
want you to look at the details too much here because that's not interesting and I really

131
0:09:09.700 --> 0:09:12.080
don't have time to explain it.

132
0:09:12.080 --> 0:09:17.320
The trick is almost everything you see here is based on signal processing, digital signal

133
0:09:17.320 --> 0:09:18.320
processing.

134
0:09:18.320 --> 0:09:19.840
That's what we're doing.

135
0:09:19.840 --> 0:09:25.120
We're using the fast Fourier transform, finite input response filters, and transforming the

136
0:09:25.120 --> 0:09:30.160
data in the frequency domain, if you will.

137
0:09:30.160 --> 0:09:34.200
Then it's put back into CPU memory at Cobalt.

138
0:09:34.200 --> 0:09:38.320
Some final transformations are being placed, and then it's put into the disk so that CEP

139
0:09:38.320 --> 0:09:41.360
can work on it.

140
0:09:41.360 --> 0:09:47.440
At Ostrone, we do a lot with software, and I've showed you now how the data flows, but

141
0:09:47.440 --> 0:09:52.680
I haven't told you what software components are making that data flow happen.

142
0:09:52.680 --> 0:09:58.600
For Cobalt, it's actually one solid product that lives in the Loafer repository.

143
0:09:58.600 --> 0:10:04.960
Please don't all now visit or get lab instance at once because it will die if you do that.

144
0:10:04.960 --> 0:10:08.560
Try to spread that out a little bit over the day.

145
0:10:08.560 --> 0:10:17.000
I'm sure I will upload the slides soon after, so you don't have to remember all this.

146
0:10:17.000 --> 0:10:22.920
All these tools that are listed here, except for Cobalt with lives in the Loafer repo,

147
0:10:22.920 --> 0:10:26.480
those are more like what you would find on the CEP side of things.

148
0:10:26.480 --> 0:10:32.400
I'm going to explain, I want to address that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

149
0:10:32.400 --> 0:10:37.440
On our GitHub repo, you can find a lot of more stuff that you can play with, and I would

150
0:10:37.440 --> 0:10:40.480
encourage you to do so because it's quite interesting.

151
0:10:40.480 --> 0:10:45.320
Then there's also CasaCore, which is heavily being developed at Ostrone as well, but it's

152
0:10:45.320 --> 0:10:48.240
not actually just a product just by us.

153
0:10:48.240 --> 0:10:52.280
A competitor or like a friend of CasaCore would be Ostropy.

154
0:10:52.280 --> 0:10:58.840
Very widely known packages in the industry.

155
0:10:58.840 --> 0:11:03.280
If you look at the radio astronomy toolkit, so the necessary things to go from antenna

156
0:11:03.280 --> 0:11:06.960
to image, if you will, then these are your friends.

157
0:11:06.960 --> 0:11:15.320
There's DP cubed, W clean, and IDG, and Rattler, AO flagger, and I'm not going to talk too

158
0:11:15.320 --> 0:11:17.120
much about every beam.

159
0:11:17.120 --> 0:11:19.000
What do these things do?

160
0:11:19.000 --> 0:11:20.480
What are we looking at here?

161
0:11:20.480 --> 0:11:23.400
DP cubed is where you define a complete pipeline.

162
0:11:23.400 --> 0:11:27.800
You have the incoming data, you need to do some transformations on the data, maybe you

163
0:11:27.800 --> 0:11:34.320
want to identify some noise sources that might be in your data, and eventually you want to

164
0:11:34.320 --> 0:11:38.200
create an image, and for this imaging you need deconvolution as well.

165
0:11:38.200 --> 0:11:40.320
You also need gridding and degridding.

166
0:11:40.320 --> 0:11:44.040
AO flagger is where you identify noise sources.

167
0:11:44.040 --> 0:11:45.840
This can be anything.

168
0:11:45.840 --> 0:11:48.160
Radio instruments are very sensitive.

169
0:11:48.160 --> 0:11:54.360
One noise source in particular would be electric fences, windmills, solar farms, bed quality

170
0:11:54.360 --> 0:11:58.120
LED lighting.

171
0:11:58.120 --> 0:12:04.880
Then we move to the imaging part with W clean, because when you have a radio telescope consisting

172
0:12:04.880 --> 0:12:11.840
of many small antennas, in between your antennas there are holes, and that means that you're

173
0:12:11.840 --> 0:12:16.080
not receiving the data as if you would have a very large parabolic dish.

174
0:12:16.080 --> 0:12:17.600
There's some differences.

175
0:12:17.600 --> 0:12:23.640
This creates some kind of fringing in the image that you need to filter out, and that's

176
0:12:23.640 --> 0:12:28.440
what the W clean together with RATLAR and IDG are doing.

177
0:12:28.440 --> 0:12:36.520
In IDG is your translation from the data domain to a domain that is useful for radio astronomical

178
0:12:36.520 --> 0:12:37.520
imaging.

179
0:12:37.520 --> 0:12:43.800
I talked a little bit about CasaCore, now it was industry widely used.

180
0:12:43.800 --> 0:12:48.840
It's based on all the packages that have been around for a very long time, but we've actually

181
0:12:48.840 --> 0:12:55.080
switched to the route now, so now CasaCore is built on top of these other packages rather

182
0:12:55.080 --> 0:12:59.560
than CasaCore depending on these other packages.

183
0:12:59.560 --> 0:13:02.280
There's several unique features here.

184
0:13:02.280 --> 0:13:09.800
The UV domain is pretty interesting, so that's the domain about the plane that is filled,

185
0:13:09.800 --> 0:13:16.560
so those holes in your surface area, if you will.

186
0:13:16.560 --> 0:13:20.840
There's some Python bindings here, so these are all very nice tools that you can just

187
0:13:20.840 --> 0:13:23.880
play with.

188
0:13:23.880 --> 0:13:27.880
We also use a lot of open source tools, and we're doing quite well.

189
0:13:27.880 --> 0:13:32.600
There's still some close source software, I'll get into that in a minute.

190
0:13:32.600 --> 0:13:40.200
We use OpenMPI, OpenMP, SLURM, GitLab, Grafana, and actually the part that I work on is PyTangle,

191
0:13:40.200 --> 0:13:42.360
which is a SCADA system.

192
0:13:42.360 --> 0:13:47.320
With supervisory control and data acquisition, that's basically your interface that we have

193
0:13:47.320 --> 0:13:49.880
on the individual stations.

194
0:13:49.880 --> 0:13:56.240
Those stations then configure underlying hardware with the antennas and the ADCs, and they report

195
0:13:56.240 --> 0:14:00.920
how they are configured to a higher level system.

196
0:14:00.920 --> 0:14:07.000
We also use Prometheus, Docker, and a variety of interesting open source tools.

197
0:14:07.000 --> 0:14:12.080
This is just the tip of the iceberg as well, there's much more.

198
0:14:12.080 --> 0:14:16.520
Next to our SEP cluster is also pretty interesting, which is actually very useful, and we also

199
0:14:16.520 --> 0:14:23.800
have a dust disk cluster, which is a cluster shared with many universities within the country.

200
0:14:23.800 --> 0:14:25.520
Things where we can improve.

201
0:14:25.520 --> 0:14:33.160
Well, we use CUDA, so that's not really open source compared to OpenCL or Falcon.

202
0:14:33.160 --> 0:14:35.880
We're using WinCC for monitoring.

203
0:14:35.880 --> 0:14:41.360
Maybe you've heard of that package, it's Windows-based, hence why it's called WinCC.

204
0:14:41.360 --> 0:14:44.920
We're trying to face that out for Gervana and Prometheus.

205
0:14:44.920 --> 0:14:47.800
That's going quite well, I'd say.

206
0:14:47.800 --> 0:14:53.880
We have a lot of closed source SPEDA fender blocks, so if you have your Xilinx or your

207
0:14:53.880 --> 0:15:01.360
Altera, then they, for instance, offer IP blocks to implement 100 gigabit internet interfaces,

208
0:15:01.360 --> 0:15:06.800
and they're not too keen on you sharing those with the whole wide world.

209
0:15:06.800 --> 0:15:09.040
Then InfiniBand firmware is pretty closed source.

210
0:15:09.040 --> 0:15:12.960
I believe there's open source versions of that, but I don't think I know if they work

211
0:15:12.960 --> 0:15:13.960
quite well.

212
0:15:13.960 --> 0:15:21.440
Then the main area that we're actually struggling is with office management tools.

213
0:15:21.440 --> 0:15:24.640
This is definitely the area that we can improve the most at Ostrone.

214
0:15:24.640 --> 0:15:27.680
We use Office 365, Slack, and Zoom.

215
0:15:27.680 --> 0:15:31.480
As you can see, Kupan, Omato, Moast, Jitsi, there's definitely open source alternatives

216
0:15:31.480 --> 0:15:36.040
to this, so there's no real reason why we should be using this.

217
0:15:36.040 --> 0:15:40.560
Of course, you need to host the infrastructure, and that also costs money, so there's some

218
0:15:40.560 --> 0:15:41.560
little way there.

219
0:15:41.560 --> 0:15:46.880
I'm not saying that it's definitely cheaper, but there's open source alternatives to this.

220
0:15:46.880 --> 0:15:52.160
Now I want to show you, I told you about IDG that does the gridding and de-gridding.

221
0:15:52.160 --> 0:15:57.880
I told you about VSWClean and the Dravata part that does the deconvolution now, and

222
0:15:57.880 --> 0:16:01.760
I want to show you how those tools work in practice.

223
0:16:01.760 --> 0:16:03.820
We have an ideal point source.

224
0:16:03.820 --> 0:16:07.880
This is our most ideal radio source that can possibly exist.

225
0:16:07.880 --> 0:16:10.840
It creates a very sharp point in the sky.

226
0:16:10.840 --> 0:16:14.440
We put it toward the gridding, and we get a point function.

227
0:16:14.440 --> 0:16:17.840
What this basically is, is this is the error of our telescope.

228
0:16:17.840 --> 0:16:23.200
We now know, okay, this is the error it's going to generate in our images, because we

229
0:16:23.200 --> 0:16:25.520
don't have complete filling of the UV plane.

230
0:16:25.520 --> 0:16:31.440
There are holes in between our antennae, and then we can use the VSWClean image together

231
0:16:31.440 --> 0:16:37.320
with Radler for deconvolution to create an iterative process in which we iteratively

232
0:16:37.320 --> 0:16:40.360
remove the noise from the image.

233
0:16:40.360 --> 0:16:41.520
Actually I'm going to see...

234
0:16:41.520 --> 0:16:44.240
Oh yeah, that's nice.

235
0:16:44.240 --> 0:16:46.000
Here you see these lines.

236
0:16:46.000 --> 0:16:51.760
These lines are the fringes that I've told, and if you then perform these iterative cleaning

237
0:16:51.760 --> 0:16:57.780
process on what are called calibrated visibilities, then we iteratively see that this image is

238
0:16:57.780 --> 0:16:59.880
drastically improved.

239
0:16:59.880 --> 0:17:02.880
Now, some example of this.

240
0:17:02.880 --> 0:17:05.560
What is the science that we do with LoFAR?

241
0:17:05.560 --> 0:17:06.960
How does this look like?

242
0:17:06.960 --> 0:17:13.320
Well, this is a paper by Eric Timmerman, so you can look at it when you spare time.

243
0:17:13.320 --> 0:17:18.240
What we're basically seeing here is we're seeing huge jets of these synchrotron radiation

244
0:17:18.240 --> 0:17:20.400
emissions that are talked about.

245
0:17:20.400 --> 0:17:25.320
You can see that they actually over millions of years, they vary in intensity.

246
0:17:25.320 --> 0:17:29.080
At the center of this image is actually a black hole, but you can't see that because

247
0:17:29.080 --> 0:17:30.600
it's a black hole.

248
0:17:30.600 --> 0:17:37.240
And then on the background of this image, there is an overlay of what's the optical

249
0:17:37.240 --> 0:17:42.040
domain, so not the radio domain, from the Hubble Space Telescope.

250
0:17:42.040 --> 0:17:45.440
This is what we've been able to capture with LoFAR.

251
0:17:45.440 --> 0:17:49.120
So we're doing groundbreaking science, and we're going to do a lot more.

252
0:17:49.120 --> 0:17:53.720
We're in the middle of a big upgrade that's scheduled for the end of 2014.

253
0:17:53.720 --> 0:17:55.760
WinCEC is going to be replaced with Kefana.

254
0:17:55.760 --> 0:18:01.840
We're thinking about Olerta, but I've heard that Kefana has persistent alarms during actually

255
0:18:01.840 --> 0:18:05.520
for STEM today, so we might not need Olerta.

256
0:18:05.520 --> 0:18:07.440
And we're using Prometheus.

257
0:18:07.440 --> 0:18:10.160
We had these low-band antennas, and the high-band antennas.

258
0:18:10.160 --> 0:18:16.760
I briefly skimped over that because the details, yeah, you have to cut some corners somewhere.

259
0:18:16.760 --> 0:18:21.960
But basically with LoFAR 2, we'll be able to use both of them in a single observation.

260
0:18:21.960 --> 0:18:26.680
We'll also be able to use multiple beams, so I talked about the beam forming currently.

261
0:18:26.680 --> 0:18:30.440
LoFAR is only able to have a single beam per observation.

262
0:18:30.440 --> 0:18:37.760
And we will also be able to point at different points in the sky, change that during an observation.

263
0:18:37.760 --> 0:18:40.040
And we call this Mega Mode.

264
0:18:40.040 --> 0:18:42.040
Don't ask me why.

265
0:18:42.040 --> 0:18:45.440
Yeah, we're completely refamping the SCADA system.

266
0:18:45.440 --> 0:18:46.440
We're now using Patango.

267
0:18:46.440 --> 0:18:49.720
We have sufficiently upgraded hardware, Unibore 2s.

268
0:18:49.720 --> 0:18:54.680
We actually sell those to external institutes as well, so they're available.

269
0:18:54.680 --> 0:18:59.680
And we're drastically improving the timing distribution, so we're currently GPS-based.

270
0:18:59.680 --> 0:19:04.120
Everything is synchronized using GPS, all the stations across Europe.

271
0:19:04.120 --> 0:19:07.160
And we're going to use the White Rabbit protocol that's made by CERN.

272
0:19:07.160 --> 0:19:11.040
That's based on the Precision Time protocol.

273
0:19:11.040 --> 0:19:15.040
Now very briefly, this Mega Mode, what would this schematically look like?

274
0:19:15.040 --> 0:19:20.160
So this is basically what's running on Cobalt or GPU cluster, and we do imaging and beam

275
0:19:20.160 --> 0:19:21.160
forming.

276
0:19:21.160 --> 0:19:25.080
And now we have one beam and several pointings.

277
0:19:25.080 --> 0:19:27.880
And they stay the same during observations.

278
0:19:27.880 --> 0:19:32.960
Now we can have multiple beams, and we can re-point during the observation.

279
0:19:32.960 --> 0:19:36.600
That's going to create a lot of flexibility for the astronomers, and I'm going to be very

280
0:19:36.600 --> 0:19:40.600
excited with the science that is going to come from this.

281
0:19:40.600 --> 0:19:47.480
I want to leave you with some links, as mentioned, our Ostrone repo, the Ostrone website.

282
0:19:47.480 --> 0:19:52.200
There's a very interesting page about 10 years of LOFR, because we've actually existed,

283
0:19:52.200 --> 0:19:57.040
LOFR has been in production since 2008, so that's been since quite some time.

284
0:19:57.040 --> 0:20:00.880
There's this very nice map on which you can actually see all the physical locations of

285
0:20:00.880 --> 0:20:06.440
all the stations, how many antennas are active or working or broken.

286
0:20:06.440 --> 0:20:07.900
So this is all open data.

287
0:20:07.900 --> 0:20:11.960
You can just look at this, and there's some history about all these presentations that

288
0:20:11.960 --> 0:20:14.200
have done in the past.

289
0:20:14.200 --> 0:20:17.360
So any questions?

290
0:20:17.360 --> 0:20:23.520
Any questions for Poutet?

291
0:20:23.520 --> 0:20:37.160
I see one.

292
0:20:37.160 --> 0:20:39.920
We first a short comment.

293
0:20:39.920 --> 0:20:46.320
The Chinese built a 500-meter dish, but that's just...

294
0:20:46.320 --> 0:20:51.560
But what I really wanted to ask is whether you have collaboration with other astrophysical

295
0:20:51.560 --> 0:20:55.640
observations like square kilometer array or something like that?

296
0:20:55.640 --> 0:21:01.080
Well actually we collaborate on the square kilometer array, so there's definitely...

297
0:21:01.080 --> 0:21:05.720
Can you repeat part of your question, because people were just leaving?

298
0:21:05.720 --> 0:21:10.160
Well, whether there is shared development in software and stuff?

299
0:21:10.160 --> 0:21:11.480
Yeah, for sure.

300
0:21:11.480 --> 0:21:16.680
For instance on CasaCore, as I mentioned, but also WSClean, we see contributions from

301
0:21:16.680 --> 0:21:26.600
external collaborators, and especially the part of Jive that I showed at the very beginning.

302
0:21:26.600 --> 0:21:28.360
Let me see.

303
0:21:28.360 --> 0:21:31.480
Shouldn't be too long.

304
0:21:31.480 --> 0:21:34.240
So here I mentioned Jive and EPN.

305
0:21:34.240 --> 0:21:39.000
This is a huge collaboration of parabolic dishes that are all connected, and all the

306
0:21:39.000 --> 0:21:49.200
data centrally to Dringalo at the headquarters of Asturong.

307
0:21:49.200 --> 0:21:53.720
And that's actually where the EPN network processes all this data.

308
0:21:53.720 --> 0:21:58.480
But all these dishes that we use, those are not ours, right?

309
0:21:58.480 --> 0:22:00.480
Those are from other parties.

310
0:22:00.480 --> 0:22:07.840
Another question from the Jack and Ralph.

311
0:22:07.840 --> 0:22:13.560
Someone's asking, since everything's processed digitally, can these telescopes focus on multiple

312
0:22:13.560 --> 0:22:18.000
targets at once by processing the data multiple times?

313
0:22:18.000 --> 0:22:20.880
That's an interesting question, and that depends.

314
0:22:20.880 --> 0:22:25.080
As I said, you have to transient buffers, which dump raw samples.

315
0:22:25.080 --> 0:22:29.840
But typically what we do is we already do beamforming on the station.

316
0:22:29.840 --> 0:22:33.080
And if you do the beamforming on the station, you're already looking at some point in the

317
0:22:33.080 --> 0:22:34.080
sky.

318
0:22:34.080 --> 0:22:38.720
You're only sending the result data from that beamforming to this cobalt cluster, and you

319
0:22:38.720 --> 0:22:40.520
can't beamform again then.

320
0:22:40.520 --> 0:22:41.520
The data is lost.

321
0:22:41.520 --> 0:22:43.160
It's reductive in nature.

322
0:22:43.160 --> 0:22:48.640
But if you would send the raw sample data to cobalt, and it could somehow process all

323
0:22:48.640 --> 0:22:56.160
the data, which I don't think it has the bandwidth to do so, then you could, at a later point

324
0:22:56.160 --> 0:23:00.800
in time, point at any point in the sky again.

325
0:23:00.800 --> 0:23:04.120
That's the job of the transient buffers.

326
0:23:04.120 --> 0:23:06.160
Thanks.

327
0:23:06.160 --> 0:23:11.840
Maybe a question here.

328
0:23:11.840 --> 0:23:20.040
Would there be any ways or interests for amateur astronomers or radio astronomers, of course,

329
0:23:20.040 --> 0:23:26.280
to help or work with astronomy?

330
0:23:26.280 --> 0:23:31.400
Well, there's definitely job positions on our page all the time, I think.

331
0:23:31.400 --> 0:23:35.960
I don't know if most are in the field of radio astronomy, but what typically happens, and

332
0:23:35.960 --> 0:23:41.280
I can briefly explain, is we have a system called NordStar in which astronomers submit

333
0:23:41.280 --> 0:23:45.400
their proposals and describe what they want to do with their instrument.

334
0:23:45.400 --> 0:23:49.960
And then we have a community that looks at that, and that actually accepts these proposals,

335
0:23:49.960 --> 0:23:50.960
and then they are scheduled.

336
0:23:50.960 --> 0:23:54.880
This is actually a very good question, because I completely skipped this in the talk, but

337
0:23:54.880 --> 0:23:56.720
I wanted to talk about this.

338
0:23:56.720 --> 0:24:01.880
And then things are scheduled in a system called TMS, and that basically looks at, okay,

339
0:24:01.880 --> 0:24:08.520
what part of these stations are required to do these observations and collect these data.

340
0:24:08.520 --> 0:24:12.440
Then these data are collected and processed on cobalt and sap, and the data products are

341
0:24:12.440 --> 0:24:16.360
made available to these individual astronomers who've done that, and they get exclusive access

342
0:24:16.360 --> 0:24:20.200
for a period of time to do their research.

343
0:24:20.200 --> 0:24:21.200
Okay, thanks.

344
0:24:21.200 --> 0:24:31.160
I was more thinking about just if someone is like in Africa with a homemade dish, is

345
0:24:31.160 --> 0:24:38.960
there any way to maybe capture something with an SDR and add a little bit to this data,

346
0:24:38.960 --> 0:24:42.400
or the scale of things is so different that...

347
0:24:42.400 --> 0:24:47.080
It's actually very important, or it's rather we need to model a lot of things and calibrate

348
0:24:47.080 --> 0:24:48.440
a lot of things.

349
0:24:48.440 --> 0:24:54.000
So that's why all the stations are roughly similar in shape, have similar hardware, so

350
0:24:54.000 --> 0:24:58.600
it would be definitely possible to buy your own station, build your own station, and have

351
0:24:58.600 --> 0:25:00.480
the same hardware, and then hook it up.

352
0:25:00.480 --> 0:25:02.720
That happens all the time.

353
0:25:02.720 --> 0:25:06.360
Different countries do that, buy stations, and then we add them.

354
0:25:06.360 --> 0:25:11.160
But having very fastly different hardware and then hooking this up to this system would

355
0:25:11.160 --> 0:25:12.160
be very difficult.

356
0:25:12.160 --> 0:25:13.440
It's not designed to do that.

357
0:25:13.440 --> 0:25:21.720
Okay, so if you would make a very cheap station that could be built by amateur astronomers,

358
0:25:21.720 --> 0:25:27.520
you could deploy that a bit everywhere in the world, and then make your public radio

359
0:25:27.520 --> 0:25:28.520
astronomy like that.

360
0:25:28.520 --> 0:25:29.520
Interesting.

361
0:25:29.520 --> 0:25:30.520
Thanks.

362
0:25:30.520 --> 0:25:31.520
Any more questions?

363
0:25:31.520 --> 0:25:32.520
Okay, we'll wrap it up.

364
0:25:32.520 --> 0:25:33.520
Okay.

365
0:25:33.520 --> 0:25:34.520
Okay.

366
0:25:34.520 --> 0:25:35.520
Okay.

367
0:25:35.520 --> 0:25:36.520
Okay.

368
0:25:36.520 --> 0:25:37.520
Okay.

369
0:25:37.520 --> 0:25:38.520
Okay.

370
0:25:38.520 --> 0:25:39.520
Okay.

371
0:25:39.520 --> 0:25:40.520
Okay.

372
0:25:40.520 --> 0:25:41.520
Okay.

373
0:25:41.520 --> 0:25:42.520
Okay.

374
0:25:42.520 --> 0:25:43.520
All right.

375
0:25:43.520 --> 0:25:44.520
Okay.

376
0:25:44.520 --> 0:25:45.520
Okay.

377
0:25:45.520 --> 0:25:46.520
Okay.

378
0:25:46.520 --> 0:25:47.520
All right.
