1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.880
Yeah, so let's start with this talk.

2
0:00:08.880 --> 0:00:14.640
My name is Marek Wachud and this talk is about U-Boot as a BSCI provider.

3
0:00:14.640 --> 0:00:18.960
Now BSCI stands for a Power State Coordination Interface.

4
0:00:18.960 --> 0:00:23.560
It's a standard drafted by ARM and it is used on ARM system.

5
0:00:23.560 --> 0:00:29.960
It defines a software interface that's used by things like bootloader as operating system.

6
0:00:29.960 --> 0:00:42.480
To bring up CPU cores, stop the CPU cores, do a system suspend, resume, perform, reboot and power off.

7
0:00:42.480 --> 0:00:47.760
The presence of the BSCI interface is mandatory on ARMv8.

8
0:00:47.760 --> 0:00:54.000
It is optional on ARMv7 although you can find ARMv7 systems which do also provide BSCI.

9
0:00:54.000 --> 0:01:03.000
There is a related interface which is called an SCMI and this is used for clock management,

10
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:06.360
power domain management of devices.

11
0:01:06.360 --> 0:01:13.080
You may sometimes see that there are systems which misuse BSCI for this kind of functionality

12
0:01:13.080 --> 0:01:17.160
like power domain on and off and this is wrong.

13
0:01:17.160 --> 0:01:20.880
So that all goes into SCMI.

14
0:01:20.880 --> 0:01:24.600
We will not talk about SCMI however right now.

15
0:01:24.600 --> 0:01:31.260
The reason why BSCI exists is multiple fault.

16
0:01:31.260 --> 0:01:32.600
One of them is convenience.

17
0:01:32.600 --> 0:01:39.700
The thing is doing these things like CPU core on, off, suspend, resume, this is a really

18
0:01:39.700 --> 0:01:45.160
horribly complex process and hardware is full of bugs so implementing it correctly so that

19
0:01:45.160 --> 0:01:51.480
your system doesn't randomly crash during suspend for example, the code is very complex.

20
0:01:51.480 --> 0:01:59.240
If you want to run multiple OSs on an ARM machine, there is a balancing act in place.

21
0:01:59.240 --> 0:02:06.400
Basically what ARM decided was to implement this once, implement it properly and then

22
0:02:06.400 --> 0:02:11.840
expose to the operating system an interface which allows it to say okay, well, now suspend

23
0:02:11.840 --> 0:02:15.120
or now bring up a CPU core.

24
0:02:15.120 --> 0:02:19.720
And all this horrible complexity and all the work arounds for the hardware bugs, they are

25
0:02:19.720 --> 0:02:25.120
hidden in this sort of an interface which is implemented once.

26
0:02:25.120 --> 0:02:28.920
So it pretty much covers the convenience, the complexity.

27
0:02:28.920 --> 0:02:35.440
The other thing is the thing which brings up CPU cores may interact with say regulators

28
0:02:35.440 --> 0:02:39.740
and this could potentially damage the hardware if you do it wrong.

29
0:02:39.740 --> 0:02:43.320
So if the hardware is very fragile, it may also be a good idea to hide this from the

30
0:02:43.320 --> 0:02:48.240
operating system which may crash and do something wrong and then potentially damage the hardware.

31
0:02:48.240 --> 0:02:51.440
That's why it's hidden in the firmware.

32
0:02:51.440 --> 0:02:57.120
However, what you may argue is that if we put this functionality in the firmware, what

33
0:02:57.120 --> 0:02:58.440
happens if the firmware is buggy?

34
0:02:58.440 --> 0:03:04.400
Then you have to update the firmware which essentially means updating your bootloader

35
0:03:04.400 --> 0:03:09.360
which is dangerous operation unless you are very well prepared for that.

36
0:03:09.360 --> 0:03:13.160
So it can break your machine if you do it wrong.

37
0:03:13.160 --> 0:03:16.080
So all of this is really a balancing act.

38
0:03:16.080 --> 0:03:21.640
Why not put it into the OS or into the bootloader?

39
0:03:21.640 --> 0:03:26.880
One completely separate reason for existence of this API is virtualization.

40
0:03:26.880 --> 0:03:33.640
So in a virtualized setup on ARM, the secure monitor firmware which is running in the highest

41
0:03:33.640 --> 0:03:39.480
privilege level provides a PSCI interface to the OS running in lower privilege mode

42
0:03:39.480 --> 0:03:41.960
which is like the EL2.

43
0:03:41.960 --> 0:03:49.480
And that OS itself can provide the same looking PSCI interface to the OS running in virtualization

44
0:03:49.480 --> 0:03:51.680
so in EL1.

45
0:03:51.680 --> 0:03:56.160
And to the OS this looks very much identical whether it's running in virtualization or

46
0:03:56.160 --> 0:03:58.400
whether it's running on bare metal.

47
0:03:58.400 --> 0:04:03.640
So for that purpose also there is the PSCI interface which allows you to bring up CPU

48
0:04:03.640 --> 0:04:08.240
cores which in one case may be virtual and in the other case they are the actual real

49
0:04:08.240 --> 0:04:11.840
CPU cores hardware ones.

50
0:04:11.840 --> 0:04:18.760
Now the way PSCI is implemented is by means of SMCCC which stands for SMCCole convention

51
0:04:18.760 --> 0:04:24.400
which is another standard drafted by ARM and it basically tells you that on ARM64 there

52
0:04:24.400 --> 0:04:31.760
are two instructions, one of them SMCC the other HVC instruction and they both trigger

53
0:04:31.760 --> 0:04:35.080
a synchronous exception.

54
0:04:35.080 --> 0:04:41.820
In case of the SMCC instruction the synchronous exception lands in exception level 3 in case

55
0:04:41.820 --> 0:04:48.820
of the HVC the synchronous exception lands in EL2 and the SMCCC also tells you which

56
0:04:48.820 --> 0:04:55.920
CPU registers to set up before you call the SMCC and which CPU registers are then used

57
0:04:55.920 --> 0:05:01.120
as a return value from the SMCC or HVC instruction.

58
0:05:01.120 --> 0:05:07.920
As for the exception levels there is four of them on ARM64 EL3 to EL0, the EL3 is the

59
0:05:07.920 --> 0:05:11.200
most privileged one.

60
0:05:11.200 --> 0:05:15.560
This is where the secure monitor firmware runs and this is also where the code which

61
0:05:15.560 --> 0:05:20.800
brings up the CPU cores and does the suspender zoom and all this is running.

62
0:05:20.800 --> 0:05:26.560
EL2 is the less privileged and this is where operating system is running, the one which

63
0:05:26.560 --> 0:05:28.760
is running on bare metal.

64
0:05:28.760 --> 0:05:34.480
You can use SMCC from the EL2 into the EL3 to request services from the secure monitor.

65
0:05:34.480 --> 0:05:44.120
EL1 is used for virtualized OS so an OS which is running in virtualization can do HVC which

66
0:05:44.120 --> 0:05:48.600
would trigger a synchronous exception in EL2 in the OS which is running on the bare metal

67
0:05:48.600 --> 0:05:54.560
and the OS running on the bare metal may provide some services to the virtualized OS this way.

68
0:05:54.560 --> 0:05:58.880
You can read all about these exception levels in the ARM specification.

69
0:05:58.880 --> 0:06:03.920
If you download the slides which are in Penta you can use all these links which will redirect

70
0:06:03.920 --> 0:06:08.200
you to all the specifications so we can just read all about that.

71
0:06:08.200 --> 0:06:13.480
Suffice to say there are these four exception levels on ARM for now.

72
0:06:13.480 --> 0:06:20.040
The way the SMCC actually works is that if you want to do an SMCC request you're supposed

73
0:06:20.040 --> 0:06:27.920
to set up CPU register zero with a function ID which basically says what kind of request

74
0:06:27.920 --> 0:06:34.800
you want performed by the secure monitor or by the OS.

75
0:06:34.800 --> 0:06:40.040
And then you're supposed to set up six additional parameters, X1 all the way to X6 which are

76
0:06:40.040 --> 0:06:45.080
parameters for this function which you want to trigger.

77
0:06:45.080 --> 0:06:50.400
With this set up you have to do the SMCC or HVC instruction.

78
0:06:50.400 --> 0:06:53.060
This instruction triggers synchronous exception.

79
0:06:53.060 --> 0:07:00.080
This synchronous exception then makes the CPU elevate its exception level to the higher

80
0:07:00.080 --> 0:07:06.960
one and trigger the exception handler which validates that the function ID is even okay

81
0:07:06.960 --> 0:07:12.760
for you to call, that the parameters for the function are okay at all.

82
0:07:12.760 --> 0:07:18.200
If all of this is correct then the request which is represented by this function ID is

83
0:07:18.200 --> 0:07:23.920
then performed by the secure monitor firmware or by the OS.

84
0:07:23.920 --> 0:07:30.320
Once the request is performed the secure monitor firmware or the OS will set up four additional

85
0:07:30.320 --> 0:07:39.440
registers X0 to X3 with the return values and will return just past the SMCC or HVC

86
0:07:39.440 --> 0:07:46.280
instruction into the calling software and resume execution at the exception level of

87
0:07:46.280 --> 0:07:48.200
the calling software.

88
0:07:48.200 --> 0:07:52.200
And then the calling software can collect the result of this call in the register of

89
0:07:52.200 --> 0:07:58.120
X0 to X3 and do something about this.

90
0:07:58.120 --> 0:08:00.480
This is roughly how it works.

91
0:08:00.480 --> 0:08:02.160
About these function IDs.

92
0:08:02.160 --> 0:08:07.320
These function IDs are the requests you can do to the secure monitor firmware or to the

93
0:08:07.320 --> 0:08:10.600
OS running in the bare metal.

94
0:08:10.600 --> 0:08:16.200
You can actually not find them in the SMCC specification because the SMCC specification

95
0:08:16.200 --> 0:08:22.680
just says there are function IDs but the blocks of these function IDs are distributed across

96
0:08:22.680 --> 0:08:28.040
various specifications like the BSCI specification which has two blocks carved out of the function

97
0:08:28.040 --> 0:08:34.680
IDs or the SCMI specification which has its own set of function IDs.

98
0:08:34.680 --> 0:08:41.720
The BSCI specification has two sets of function IDs, one is for 32-bit BSCI calls, the other

99
0:08:41.720 --> 0:08:45.120
is for 64-bit BSCI calls.

100
0:08:45.120 --> 0:08:51.600
The only reason for this is that 64-bit BSCI calls just take 64-bit parameters so the function

101
0:08:51.600 --> 0:08:54.560
signature is slightly different.

102
0:08:54.560 --> 0:09:00.640
But beyond that it's very much compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit BSCI functions and

103
0:09:00.640 --> 0:09:04.000
function implementations.

104
0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:07.760
So you can look up the function IDs obviously in the BSCI specification.

105
0:09:07.760 --> 0:09:13.080
You can also look them up in the U-Boot sources, you can look them up in the Linux kernel sources.

106
0:09:13.080 --> 0:09:16.440
This stuff here is coming from the U-Boot sources.

107
0:09:16.440 --> 0:09:19.760
Hello.

108
0:09:19.760 --> 0:09:26.240
So what you can see here is for example CPU on BSCI function which is actually a macro

109
0:09:26.240 --> 0:09:36.440
which is expanded to like E4 or C4 I'm sorry C4 plus 3.

110
0:09:36.440 --> 0:09:46.240
So this would actually go into the SMC register X0 before you call the SMC instruction.

111
0:09:46.240 --> 0:09:55.080
Now there are multiple callers of the SMC instruction as well as multiple handlers.

112
0:09:55.080 --> 0:09:57.440
There are callers in U-Boot.

113
0:09:57.440 --> 0:10:03.680
This is all built around this as we call it the SMC call and HVC call implementation.

114
0:10:03.680 --> 0:10:09.600
In Linux the BSCI implementation lives in driver's firmware BSCI, BSCI.C.

115
0:10:09.600 --> 0:10:15.720
The handlers are either in ATF or in U-Boot itself.

116
0:10:15.720 --> 0:10:23.120
The U-Boot SMC callers are all built around this SMC call function.

117
0:10:23.120 --> 0:10:29.720
So like anything in U-Boot which does BSCI interaction is essentially SMC call, BSCI

118
0:10:29.720 --> 0:10:34.000
function name and then some parameters for the BSCI function.

119
0:10:34.000 --> 0:10:39.720
If you look at the SMC call in U-Boot actually it very much copies what's in the SMC C-C.

120
0:10:39.720 --> 0:10:45.880
So that means set up register X0 with function ID, set up a couple of parameter registers

121
0:10:45.880 --> 0:10:53.360
X1 to X6 then trigger the SMC instruction, once the SMC instruction request is done the

122
0:10:53.360 --> 0:11:01.040
execution will return past the SMC instruction and continue here where the U-Boot code will

123
0:11:01.040 --> 0:11:07.120
collect the registers which were set up by the secure monitor firmware as the written

124
0:11:07.120 --> 0:11:12.520
values from the SMC instruction and then you can use them in the U-Boot code.

125
0:11:12.520 --> 0:11:19.120
There is a matching HVC call a little bit further in this FVC call.C in U-Boot if you

126
0:11:19.120 --> 0:11:25.440
want to look it up which is used for the EL2 HVC call.

127
0:11:25.440 --> 0:11:30.240
U-Boot has the bonus thing that it actually has a command which is called an SMC.

128
0:11:30.240 --> 0:11:37.980
So in the U-Boot command line you can experiment with the SMC calls and it's a command which

129
0:11:37.980 --> 0:11:41.800
takes seven parameters up to seven parameters.

130
0:11:41.800 --> 0:11:48.040
The first parameter is the SMC function ID and then the six additional parameters are

131
0:11:48.040 --> 0:11:49.920
the parameters for the SMC function.

132
0:11:49.920 --> 0:11:55.840
So if you want to do like a PSCI call I think this one is like PSCI version here you can

133
0:11:55.840 --> 0:12:00.960
do it like from the U-Boot command line and you can experiment with this all you want.

134
0:12:00.960 --> 0:12:16.640
The return value from the SMC command is four values which is the X0, X1, X2 and X3 CPU registers.

135
0:12:16.640 --> 0:12:25.640
So you can then analyze what you got out of the SMC call if it didn't fail obviously.

136
0:12:25.640 --> 0:12:33.320
As for the Linux kernel there is this additional thing in Linux than when the PSCI firmware

137
0:12:33.320 --> 0:12:37.480
driver is probing Linux has to figure out whether it is running on bare metal or in

138
0:12:37.480 --> 0:12:39.200
virtualization.

139
0:12:39.200 --> 0:12:44.160
So if Linux is running on bare metal then it uses the SMC instruction to communicate

140
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:48.480
with the secure monitor firmware otherwise it's using the HVC instruction if it's running

141
0:12:48.480 --> 0:12:53.660
in virtualization to communicate with the OS that's running on the bare metal.

142
0:12:53.660 --> 0:13:01.920
But beyond that the PSCI firmware driver in Linux just exposes the PSCI functions as a

143
0:13:01.920 --> 0:13:11.840
wrapper around SMC calls and the actual SMC instruction call and the setup of the X0 all

144
0:13:11.840 --> 0:13:13.880
the way to X6 registers.

145
0:13:13.880 --> 0:13:19.560
This is implemented in SMCC call.s in R64.

146
0:13:19.560 --> 0:13:25.480
So it's very much yet again a wrapper around the SMC instruction no matter whether it's

147
0:13:25.480 --> 0:13:30.160
U-Boot, whether it's Linux.

148
0:13:30.160 --> 0:13:35.320
But now let's talk about the more interesting part which are the handlers.

149
0:13:35.320 --> 0:13:44.000
And for one to be an SMC handler the CPU core has to fulfill a couple of requirements.

150
0:13:44.000 --> 0:13:51.520
The main requirement to handle SMC exceptions is to be able to even receive the exceptions.

151
0:13:51.520 --> 0:13:57.400
So the CPU core basically has to be able to receive exception in EL3 if it wants to handle

152
0:13:57.400 --> 0:13:59.120
SMC.

153
0:13:59.120 --> 0:14:04.120
If you are on an SMP system you also have to be able to receive IPIs, interprocessor

154
0:14:04.120 --> 0:14:11.280
interrupts because in order to bring up secondary cores it is necessary for the secondary cores

155
0:14:11.280 --> 0:14:22.600
to be able to receive IPIs to break them out of a loop in the PSCI provider firmware because

156
0:14:22.600 --> 0:14:25.280
the OS is not immediately ready for the secondary cores.

157
0:14:25.280 --> 0:14:28.760
I'll explain that in a bit.

158
0:14:28.760 --> 0:14:35.960
In U-Boot most of this PSCI and synchronous exception handling code is actually in place

159
0:14:35.960 --> 0:14:39.280
already and it's all generic code.

160
0:14:39.280 --> 0:14:47.600
So the U-Boot entry point is very much here in the stub.s and the PSCI synchronous exception

161
0:14:47.600 --> 0:14:51.280
handling code is here in PSCI.s.

162
0:14:51.280 --> 0:14:56.120
It's there both for ARM32 and ARM64, it's just in different subdirectories.

163
0:14:56.120 --> 0:15:01.960
All you as a user actually have to implement is the PSCI.c which are the C callbacks of

164
0:15:01.960 --> 0:15:10.360
the actual PSCI functions functionality which perform the stuff which the PSCI function

165
0:15:10.360 --> 0:15:17.640
are supposed to do with the hardware like start the CPU core, stop the CPU core.

166
0:15:17.640 --> 0:15:24.400
So all this stuff is generic, all this stuff is SOAK specific and if you decide to implement

167
0:15:24.400 --> 0:15:30.200
PSCI provider in U-Boot you have to fill that in.

168
0:15:30.200 --> 0:15:37.280
Now if a U-Boot is configured as a PSCI provider then U-Boot is running in EL3, that means

169
0:15:37.280 --> 0:15:41.940
in the highest execution level, exception level.

170
0:15:41.940 --> 0:15:48.200
That means U-Boot is not able to perform any SMC calls so you have to make sure there are

171
0:15:48.200 --> 0:15:52.640
none because otherwise the system would just hang on boot.

172
0:15:52.640 --> 0:15:58.200
The OS will be running in EL2 and it will be able to do SMC calls into the U-Boot synchronous

173
0:15:58.200 --> 0:15:59.200
exception handler.

174
0:15:59.200 --> 0:16:01.920
So this is something to keep in mind.

175
0:16:01.920 --> 0:16:08.200
Beyond that if U-Boot is configured to be a PSCI provider there is only really a little

176
0:16:08.200 --> 0:16:15.400
bit of additional setup when the U-Boot starts up in this MV8 setup PSCI and this code does

177
0:16:15.400 --> 0:16:25.200
basically that it takes parts of U-Boot which are marked with attribute secure which is

178
0:16:25.200 --> 0:16:27.220
essentially the PSCI handling code.

179
0:16:27.220 --> 0:16:33.600
It copies it into an SRAM, then it set up some M-U tables and flags this SRAM with a

180
0:16:33.600 --> 0:16:35.160
secure bit.

181
0:16:35.160 --> 0:16:42.160
That means no code running in not EL3, that means anything lower than EL3 will be able

182
0:16:42.160 --> 0:16:45.240
to modify this secure handling code.

183
0:16:45.240 --> 0:16:52.600
And finally the U-Boot sets up an exception vector so that when the synchronous exception

184
0:16:52.600 --> 0:17:00.160
happens it will land in the U-Boot synchronous exception handler and then enter the PSCI code.

185
0:17:00.160 --> 0:17:10.280
So when such a synchronous exception happens the U-Boot synchronous exception handler is

186
0:17:10.280 --> 0:17:11.280
entered.

187
0:17:11.280 --> 0:17:23.400
So when like an OS does SMC call it will land here in the MV8-PSCI.S handle thing and at

188
0:17:23.400 --> 0:17:26.680
that point the synchronous exception can be anything.

189
0:17:26.680 --> 0:17:31.160
So first we have to figure out whether this is even an SMC at all or it could be a hardware

190
0:17:31.160 --> 0:17:37.040
fault, it could be an unknown SMC exception which we cannot even handle.

191
0:17:37.040 --> 0:17:43.240
If it is an SMC exception we need to figure out whether it's a 32-bit one or 64-bit one.

192
0:17:43.240 --> 0:17:52.880
Assuming it's an SMC64 on MV8 we still need to figure out whether this is even a PSCI

193
0:17:52.880 --> 0:17:56.160
exception or it could be another type of an SMC.

194
0:17:56.160 --> 0:18:05.360
If it is a PSCI then U-Boot looks up the callback function which implements the PSCI function

195
0:18:05.360 --> 0:18:12.080
ID if it even exists in U-Boot and if it does then it sets up a C runtime environment and

196
0:18:12.080 --> 0:18:18.960
jumps onto the C function which then looks very much like this and in this C function

197
0:18:18.960 --> 0:18:24.400
you can just do like a write into a register and for example in this case power of the

198
0:18:24.400 --> 0:18:28.920
system and like you don't have to care about the assembler before that all you have to

199
0:18:28.920 --> 0:18:33.880
care about whether the PSCI provider is very much this because this is so specific and

200
0:18:33.880 --> 0:18:36.800
this is something you have to implement.

201
0:18:36.800 --> 0:18:46.320
Now on S&P there is this additional problem in that when the operating system running

202
0:18:46.320 --> 0:18:52.120
in EL2 requests from the PSCI provider that it wants to bring up secondary core the operating

203
0:18:52.120 --> 0:18:58.840
system will pass through the PSCI pointer for the OS entry point but you cannot just

204
0:18:58.840 --> 0:19:04.680
turn on the secondary core which will start up in EL3 and point it into the OS entry point

205
0:19:04.680 --> 0:19:06.640
because this would be a security violation.

206
0:19:06.640 --> 0:19:11.360
You would essentially start the CPU core which is running at the highest privilege level

207
0:19:11.360 --> 0:19:15.680
and make it enter the operating system in some sort of a highest privilege level state

208
0:19:15.680 --> 0:19:18.840
even though the OS is running in lower privilege state.

209
0:19:18.840 --> 0:19:24.120
So what happens there is the CPU core actually has to enter U-Boot.

210
0:19:24.120 --> 0:19:30.720
In the U-Boot init code the CPU core gets configured, gets set in a defined state so

211
0:19:30.720 --> 0:19:33.120
that it can enter the OS.

212
0:19:33.120 --> 0:19:40.840
The CPU core GIC the interrupt controller registers are configured so that it can receive

213
0:19:40.840 --> 0:19:48.340
an IPI then the CPU core drops into EL2 and then the CPU core starts spinning and waiting

214
0:19:48.340 --> 0:19:54.600
for an IPI so that when the operating system is actually ready to receive the CPU core

215
0:19:54.600 --> 0:20:02.120
it can ping it with an IPI and the CPU core will then be released to the operating system

216
0:20:02.120 --> 0:20:06.080
and it jumps to the operating system entry point and then the operating system runs on

217
0:20:06.080 --> 0:20:07.880
two cores.

218
0:20:07.880 --> 0:20:12.560
So this is the detail with an SMP.

219
0:20:12.560 --> 0:20:20.080
Finally here is a summary of what to do in case you want to use U-Boot as a PSCI provider.

220
0:20:20.080 --> 0:20:25.040
So you have to look up the GIC distributor and redistributor base.

221
0:20:25.040 --> 0:20:28.920
This is something which you find out in your SOC data sheet or if there is a Linux device

222
0:20:28.920 --> 0:20:35.640
today it's already there and define these two macros GIC debase and GIGR base.

223
0:20:35.640 --> 0:20:39.240
Then you have to make sure that your Drem is marked as non-secure because sometimes

224
0:20:39.240 --> 0:20:45.760
it is marked as secure and if it is marked as secure in the MMU tables then your OS will

225
0:20:45.760 --> 0:20:49.480
not be able to access Drem and it will crash.

226
0:20:49.480 --> 0:20:53.440
You potentially have to configure other security related registers of the CPU.

227
0:20:53.440 --> 0:20:56.260
This is again SOC specific.

228
0:20:56.260 --> 0:20:59.640
You have to look it up in your SOC data sheet.

229
0:20:59.640 --> 0:21:06.520
Then finally the main part of the implementation is fill in your PSCI.C callback implementation

230
0:21:06.520 --> 0:21:15.300
again SOC specific and then remove the previews PL31 PSCI implementation block which potentially

231
0:21:15.300 --> 0:21:17.720
was ATF.

232
0:21:17.720 --> 0:21:23.520
Enable these U-Boot config options give or take in the U-Boot port config and compile

233
0:21:23.520 --> 0:21:28.960
and then it should basically work.

234
0:21:28.960 --> 0:21:33.360
And in case it doesn't work U-Boot has the debug UART functionality.

235
0:21:33.360 --> 0:21:38.320
So if you have two UARTs on your machine you can point the debug UART into the other UART

236
0:21:38.320 --> 0:21:44.680
not the console UART and use this dedicated lightweight printing mechanism to essentially

237
0:21:44.680 --> 0:21:52.580
print some sort of debug output from the U-Boot PSCI provider the secure part even while the

238
0:21:52.580 --> 0:21:59.160
Linux kernel is running it is possible to get some debug UART prints out of this.

239
0:21:59.160 --> 0:22:02.320
Here are the config options which you used for that.

240
0:22:02.320 --> 0:22:08.080
And now since I'm through my slides I promised an example.

241
0:22:08.080 --> 0:22:10.280
So this will be very boring.

242
0:22:10.280 --> 0:22:17.160
Here is U-Boot and if you are familiar with U-Boot this is how it looks and it just looks

243
0:22:17.160 --> 0:22:23.800
all the same except if you are familiar with U-Boot on iamix 8M plus or iamix 8M in general

244
0:22:23.800 --> 0:22:26.800
you may notice that there is no notice here.

245
0:22:26.800 --> 0:22:31.800
The notice comes from the ATF PL31 blob and the blob is not there because the U-Boot is

246
0:22:31.800 --> 0:22:34.200
the provider of that functionality now.

247
0:22:34.200 --> 0:22:37.560
But beyond that I can boot the Linux kernel the same.

248
0:22:37.560 --> 0:22:42.320
The Linux kernel detects that there is a PSCI interface in the firmware which is now provided

249
0:22:42.320 --> 0:22:44.400
by the U-Boot.

250
0:22:44.400 --> 0:22:47.240
The Linux kernel brings up the CPU cores.

251
0:22:47.240 --> 0:22:52.880
The CPU cores show up in pro CPU info and the CPU cores just work.

252
0:22:52.880 --> 0:22:55.440
And that's actually all there is to show.

253
0:22:55.440 --> 0:23:00.640
It's exactly the same as it was with the blob except now you have one less entry in the

254
0:23:00.640 --> 0:23:03.120
S-Boot.

255
0:23:03.120 --> 0:23:08.000
So you no longer need the ATF PL31 blob which is bundled with U-Boot because U-Boot can

256
0:23:08.000 --> 0:23:09.520
do it now for you.

257
0:23:09.520 --> 0:23:14.640
And by the way this stuff is now upstream since two days ago.

258
0:23:14.640 --> 0:23:21.760
In case you enable a debug UART you will see some sort of a debug print out of the secure

259
0:23:21.760 --> 0:23:23.040
part of U-Boot.

260
0:23:23.040 --> 0:23:27.720
For example here is a PSCI CPU164.

261
0:23:27.720 --> 0:23:34.000
This is the Linux kernel sending the PSCI request to U-Boot and you would just bring

262
0:23:34.000 --> 0:23:37.560
up the CPU core down for the Linux kernel.

263
0:23:37.560 --> 0:23:38.560
And that's it.

264
0:23:38.560 --> 0:23:49.560
Thank you for your attention.

265
0:23:49.560 --> 0:23:50.560
Questions?

266
0:23:50.560 --> 0:23:51.560
Yeah.

267
0:23:51.560 --> 0:23:58.320
So, if you have an existing ATF implementing PSCI and you want to move to U-Boot you have

268
0:23:58.320 --> 0:24:00.120
to convert everything at once.

269
0:24:00.120 --> 0:24:05.400
There's no way to like step by step move functionality over.

270
0:24:05.400 --> 0:24:07.920
So you see the functionality is actually super simple.

271
0:24:07.920 --> 0:24:12.720
I mean all you have to do is like turn on CPU core, turn off CPU core and suspend and

272
0:24:12.720 --> 0:24:14.680
power off and reset.

273
0:24:14.680 --> 0:24:17.760
And this is like 200 lines of code.

274
0:24:17.760 --> 0:24:21.920
So it's like super simple really.

275
0:24:21.920 --> 0:24:26.080
And it's actually all now upstream for iMix ADAM plus.

276
0:24:26.080 --> 0:24:48.840
So we can actually just use that as an inspiration.
