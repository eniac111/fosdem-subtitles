1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Okay, now we come down.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:08.000
All right.

3
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:10.000
So last talk.

4
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:11.000
All right.

5
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:13.000
Testing, testing.

6
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:14.000
Okay.

7
0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:21.000
So, starting here, my talk is about developing effective testing pipelines for HPC applications.

8
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:27.000
Just to give a short introduction about who I am, relatively new here.

9
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:31.000
So, you know, I first started in the HPC industry while I was in college.

10
0:00:31.000 --> 0:00:37.000
I joined my university's HPC institute as a software consultant.

11
0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:40.000
So largely in that role, I was kind of more focused on support.

12
0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:45.000
So in that case, I was working on, like, singularity deployments, you know, helping debug Fortran.

13
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:50.000
Not very good at writing Fortran, you know, helping build custom kernels for Jupyter, all that good stuff.

14
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:58.000
And then I left for a bit to go work at another university to do some adversarial machine learning workflow orchestration framework.

15
0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:04.000
And then eventually I came back to my university's HPC site then as an engineer instead of a kind of support role.

16
0:01:04.000 --> 0:01:11.000
So more in that case, what I worked on was, like, building, you know, a suite of singularity containers that clients could consume.

17
0:01:11.000 --> 0:01:17.000
And then also working on, like, debugging tools that interfaced with, like, MOAB and Torque and PBS and all that.

18
0:01:17.000 --> 0:01:20.000
And then after I graduated university, I joined Canonical.

19
0:01:20.000 --> 0:01:24.000
So that was probably, like, nine months ago now.

20
0:01:24.000 --> 0:01:34.000
So, you know, kind of the start then, you know, what sent me down this path of wanting to develop effective testing pipelines for HPC applications?

21
0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:39.000
Well, first, when I started at Canonical, to be frank, I wasn't very good at Debian packaging.

22
0:01:39.000 --> 0:01:44.000
I had mostly deployed most of my software using batch scripts, compiling from source.

23
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:47.000
So part of that is I had to write provisioning scripts.

24
0:01:47.000 --> 0:01:53.000
So I mostly work in cloud orchestration, deploying, like, nodes and whatnot onto clouds.

25
0:01:53.000 --> 0:01:56.000
And so I had to, you know, develop dangerous code.

26
0:01:56.000 --> 0:02:03.000
You know, so it's installing packages, making configurations, kind of setting pre-seats in, what is it, Debian Ubuntu.

27
0:02:03.000 --> 0:02:13.000
And so basically I kind of had this, you know, dilemma of where, okay, I want an easy way to test these provisioning scripts without kind of having to go through all this manual effort.

28
0:02:13.000 --> 0:02:23.000
So originally, you know, I just, you know, typed in Vagrant virtual box or any real kind of virtual machine hypervisor, bring it up, install the script, and then once I was done with it, blow it out.

29
0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:36.000
And then kind of also had this issue of where I had a desire for reproducible tests, because even though, like, you know, I know how to bring up, like, a virtual machine on my system, you know, I might be working with someone who's off of Windows or Mac,

30
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:41.000
and so they don't have the same setup that I do, or they're using a different distribution, in fact.

31
0:02:41.000 --> 0:02:56.000
So this gave me the idea of, you know, kind of if I'm on my personal workstation here, so my laptop, unfortunately my current laptop's X server isn't working, so the HDMI cable gets all screwed up, so thank you EasyBuild folks for lending me your computer.

32
0:02:56.000 --> 0:03:14.000
But basically I had the idea that what if I take a test that's written on my system, and then have the ability to run it using any hypervisor I want on any operating system that I need to test that code on without any extra hassle of having to really go through supporting or teaching someone else how to bring up that instance.

33
0:03:14.000 --> 0:03:23.000
And basically the case of like, oh, I have the right code, like Python or anything else that needs to run like Ubuntu, CentOS, Alma, or Rocky.

34
0:03:23.000 --> 0:03:39.000
And then kind of after working for that a bit, you know, I had kind of an initial prototype that would bring up, you know, basic operating system image, and then kind of as I, you know, got more into my HPC work at Canonical, I kind of realized like, oh, okay, you know, maybe

35
0:03:39.000 --> 0:03:58.000
don't want to rack up the cloud bill trying to test and deploy to AWS or, you know, Azure or, you know, even our own private internal public cloud use or private cloud using OpenStack for, you know, just trying to provision HPC nodes. So for example, have like identity management, OpenLDAP, shared file system using MFS, you know, have other options.

36
0:03:58.000 --> 0:04:12.000
And then also working in the case of just setting up and configuring a CIRM cluster all kind of headless without any kind of manual user intervention. And so I kind of had this revelation where I'm like, why waste precious compute time on your HPC cluster?

37
0:04:12.000 --> 0:04:27.000
Because the fact is, it's expensive, you know, you're kind of paying for that tenancy. And what if you could test your simulations, jobs, applications, or applications and whatnot on a mini HPC cluster that's kind of similar to the target platform that you're deploying, but it's more of a mock so that you can kind of get the general

38
0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:34.000
feel for the platform before moving on to the more expensive resources.

39
0:04:34.000 --> 0:04:52.000
So in this case, you know, I started working on a custom testing framework called clean test, which is basically a fancy Python testing library that allows you to bring up many HPC clusters on your local system. And, you know, just kind of in general usage for developers who are in a hurry.

40
0:04:52.000 --> 0:05:05.000
So kind of then breaking into question, you know, what exactly is a clean test? Because, you know, originally I named it simple test because I just wanted it to be really dead simple. But for some reason, PyPI wouldn't let me register that name.

41
0:05:05.000 --> 0:05:21.000
So clean test it is. So basically, it comes in three parts. There's kind of a different breakdown. So first you have the bootstrap and configuration stage. So for that, it's kind of where you can register hooks and whatnot for configuring the instances that you're bringing up or

42
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:38.000
do some more advanced bootstrapping. So the example I showed in the previous slide of where you're able to bring up NFS, open LDAP, and then be able to inject scriptlets into that. So kind of that's when we get to the second part here, which is a testlet.

43
0:05:38.000 --> 0:05:56.000
Kind of interesting little word that I came up with joking with some of my colleagues. But basically, a testlet is an entire Python program that's wrapped into a regular function. And kind of the idea is that they contain the full body of the test that you want to be able to run inside this virtual machine container or, you know, test mini cluster.

44
0:05:56.000 --> 0:06:11.000
And then kind of the last part here is the evaluation reporting aspects. And then kind of with that, you know, I took a test, you know, sub test framework agnostic approach where I know that everyone kind of has their own taste that they like. Some people like Py tests, some like unit tests.

45
0:06:11.000 --> 0:06:20.000
You know, I don't want to sit here and make opinions for you. So, you know, I want you to be able to write tests in the format that you're most comfortable with.

46
0:06:20.000 --> 0:06:36.000
Oh, that came out small, but that's okay. So kind of the first part here is the going more advanced into like what exactly is the bootstrap and configuration is that you're able to bring up example nodes, you're able to provision them.

47
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:47.000
What is it? You can also register hooks. So kind of similar to anyone who's done any Debian packaging. Listening to Todd, I don't think he's still here. Yeah, you seem to have some experience with Debian developers.

48
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:51.000
Oh, but it's okay.

49
0:06:51.000 --> 0:06:53.000
It's cool.

50
0:06:53.000 --> 0:07:07.000
But yeah, so if anyone's ever like worked with P builder before I'm kind of one of the features that I really like about P builder for building Debian packages is that you can have different hooks that you can ingest so that or you can create that run at certain parts of the package build.

51
0:07:07.000 --> 0:07:22.000
I kind of wanted to replicate that same functionality and then kind of the general process is instantiating a configure instance. So that's like a Python singleton class object that basically takes in all that info shares it across, you know, the whole test suite.

52
0:07:22.000 --> 0:07:36.000
It can bring up nodes that you need to and then you define your hooks. So that's kind of like, what do I want to run when I start the environment and then register them so that, you know, when you run the tasks, the program knows about it.

53
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:52.000
And then kind of the next part here is the testlets. So that part is kind of uses some little bit more tricky programming. So in this case, I use Python decorators and metaprogramming so kind of reading class descriptors and whatnot assessing the current state of the program.

54
0:07:52.000 --> 0:08:09.000
And what the decorators do in this case with the metaprogramming is that rather than having that function run locally instead, it kind of takes out the body of that function that you defined and then it was it injects it inside of the container instance and runs it there.

55
0:08:09.000 --> 0:08:20.000
So the idea is that like, oh, you could be working off of a new bunch of machine, but you're developing for a cluster that's running a rocky Linux. So in that case, you can just easily bring it up, inject it in there, get the results back.

56
0:08:20.000 --> 0:08:30.000
And then finally, kind of the last part evaluation slash reporting, it's like each testlet kind of returns this results object. So that kind of contains an exit code standard out standard error.

57
0:08:30.000 --> 0:08:42.000
And from there you can evaluate the results locally instead of having to kind of instead do it inside of the container. So you could say like, oh, in this case, if you like doing a spread test.

58
0:08:42.000 --> 0:08:53.000
So kind of if you have like, oh, you know, I need to test this on Ubuntu 2204, 2004 and 1804, it returns a generator object of the name and the result.

59
0:08:53.000 --> 0:09:04.000
So, you know, let's say that your code works on 2204 and 2004, but the version of Python on 1804 is too old for what you're trying to do. So report back as an error.

60
0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:13.000
So kind of then, you know, breaking into how does it exactly work. So the idea is that you kind of start on your local host. So that's kind of your computer there.

61
0:09:13.000 --> 0:09:21.000
So you have the host operating system and then you have the clean test package installed as you know, I'm part of your Python interpreter, just regular Python package.

62
0:09:21.000 --> 0:09:33.000
The idea is that then, as you see that dotted line in the middle there, it then makes the request, the hypervisor of your choice and tells it like, hey, so, you know, the user who wrote this test told me that I need to bring this up.

63
0:09:33.000 --> 0:09:37.000
Told me that I need to bring up a certain instance.

64
0:09:37.000 --> 0:09:52.000
You know, says that they need like a CentOS image. So bring up a CentOS image for me. And then once that's done, you know, what clean test does is that it takes that test body function and it kind of creates a simple JSON packet, which is a checksum to verify the authenticity of the testlet.

65
0:09:52.000 --> 0:10:04.000
The data, which is just basically the testlet encoded and then or any data necessary for the Tesla and then the injectable, which is basically like, hey, you know, when you get this data packet, here's what you need to do with it.

66
0:10:04.000 --> 0:10:21.000
And then once that happens, then, you know, clean test, what it does is that it copies itself onto the container image and then from there it ingest that data packet does the evaluation that you requested and then it returns that result object back to the clean test that's on local host.

67
0:10:21.000 --> 0:10:33.000
So kind of two different ways that it works then for like, how do you control the hypervisor? The first way is kind of Archon, which is a fancy word for director. You know, I kind of wanted to have a buzzword in there somewhere.

68
0:10:33.000 --> 0:10:54.000
But the idea is that what the Archon does is that's kind of more declarative approach to doing clean tests. So rather than, you know, saying like, oh, you know, automatically do this rapid, you know, you can kind of direct the deployment of said mini HPC cluster. And then what harness does is that instead of, you know, having to explicitly declare like this is the infrastructure that I want for my deployment.

69
0:10:54.000 --> 0:11:00.000
It just brings up an instance based on the function that it's been wrapped around.

70
0:11:00.000 --> 0:11:06.000
So this is a short demo video. Let's see if I can choose better quality here.

71
0:11:06.000 --> 0:11:14.000
Don't tell me. Came as a PDF, but let's see here. All right. YouTube. Sweet.

72
0:11:14.000 --> 0:11:17.000
They go full spring. There we go.

73
0:11:17.000 --> 0:11:20.000
Settings playback.

74
0:11:20.000 --> 0:11:22.000
There we go.

75
0:11:22.000 --> 0:11:31.000
It's a little interesting. Yeah. So basically what happens here is that just using like simple talks in that case I use talks as kind of the test administrator.

76
0:11:31.000 --> 0:11:41.000
I started tests just called the Archon, which basically says bring up a test environment instance. So first it starts with LDAP. So it's provisioning an LDAP node on top of LXD hypervisor. That's what I'm using here.

77
0:11:41.000 --> 0:11:43.000
So first it starts with LDAP.

78
0:11:43.000 --> 0:11:46.000
And then after a few minutes, takes a few minutes for it to boot.

79
0:11:46.000 --> 0:11:50.000
Crappy hotel Wi-Fi was when I was doing this.

80
0:11:50.000 --> 0:11:55.000
And then see there now you have the NFS image.

81
0:11:55.000 --> 0:12:06.000
That starts provisioning and then somewhere in here. Now you have the slurm CT LD node that comes up.

82
0:12:06.000 --> 0:12:10.000
And now you have the slurm three storm compute nodes that come up.

83
0:12:10.000 --> 0:12:23.000
And the idea is that then what the framework does is that it injects a testlet inside of slurm CT LD and then from there it uses s batch to submit the job off to the test cluster.

84
0:12:23.000 --> 0:12:31.000
Takes a bit.

85
0:12:31.000 --> 0:12:33.000
A little too far ahead.

86
0:12:33.000 --> 0:12:36.000
Give it a few seconds.

87
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:44.000
Yep. And then it cleans up the cluster so that it doesn't linger on afterwards.

88
0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:49.000
Oh, goodbye.

89
0:12:49.000 --> 0:12:51.000
Oh, God.

90
0:12:51.000 --> 0:12:57.000
What happened here?

91
0:12:57.000 --> 0:12:59.000
All right. Okay.

92
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:06.000
That's not fun.

93
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:15.000
I want to go back to the video. I don't know why I jumped at the other video.

94
0:13:15.000 --> 0:13:17.000
I just had an auto play moment.

95
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:28.000
Wow. I feel like a school teacher.

96
0:13:28.000 --> 0:13:38.000
This is like right for the end. Okay. All right. Thank you.

97
0:13:38.000 --> 0:13:40.000
Yeah. All right. Okay.

98
0:13:40.000 --> 0:13:49.000
No auto play. All right. So basically what happens here. I'm going to full screen it so it's a little bit bigger.

99
0:13:49.000 --> 0:13:52.000
What? Come on.

100
0:13:52.000 --> 0:13:58.000
I'm an engineer, not a YouTube video player on a projector kind of guy. But what is it? Yeah.

101
0:13:58.000 --> 0:14:04.000
So basically what I've seen here is that the test starts, brings up the nodes that you need to use.

102
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:10.000
So in that case it was just LDAP for basic identity management and a FES for shared file system

103
0:14:10.000 --> 0:14:13.000
and then just like slurm for kind of resource management services.

104
0:14:13.000 --> 0:14:17.000
And then from there it just like injects like a little test script to run.

105
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:22.000
And then, yeah, once the job succeeds it kind of copies back to the results.

106
0:14:22.000 --> 0:14:27.000
And then, yeah, and then it says like, okay, did we get the result that we expect?

107
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:34.000
So in the case of the test that I wrote, it just prints out basically like I love doing research.

108
0:14:34.000 --> 0:14:38.000
And then it says like is I love doing research in the log file for standard out.

109
0:14:38.000 --> 0:14:44.000
So yeah. Pretty low fidelity right now is mostly a lot of work went into just getting it to work and all that.

110
0:14:44.000 --> 0:14:50.000
Okay. Now I want to go back to the slides. There we go.

111
0:14:50.000 --> 0:14:56.000
Hey. So now you saw that video, you know, kind of over going some of the current limitations.

112
0:14:56.000 --> 0:15:00.000
The first is that I'm kind of bad at playing YouTube videos and presentations.

113
0:15:00.000 --> 0:15:08.000
But the next part here is that kind of right now the issue is that there's kind of a lack of robust multi-distribution support.

114
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:12.000
So currently I mostly developed it to work on Ubuntu and work with Ubuntu.

115
0:15:12.000 --> 0:15:18.000
I wonder why. But you can't launch all the Rocky, Sennelas, Arch instances, etc.,

116
0:15:18.000 --> 0:15:24.000
but kind of the macros, hooks, and like utilities that I built into the framework aren't really fully there yet for supporting it.

117
0:15:24.000 --> 0:15:29.000
And then public documentation is behind because, you know, usually I write code before I write documentation.

118
0:15:29.000 --> 0:15:33.000
Fortunately, it just seems to be how it always goes. Yeah.

119
0:15:33.000 --> 0:15:39.000
So I need to update that. And then kind of big issue right now is lack of package manager integration.

120
0:15:39.000 --> 0:15:43.000
So a lot of the support has been added ad hoc. So currently I support like charm libraries,

121
0:15:43.000 --> 0:15:49.000
which is something that Canonical uses and then snap packages, which are kind of controversial, depending on your opinions.

122
0:15:49.000 --> 0:15:52.000
And then also just pips because I do a lot of Python development.

123
0:15:52.000 --> 0:15:59.000
But in the future, I hope to add support for like Debian packages, RPMs, you know, arch installs, smack and easy build.

124
0:15:59.000 --> 0:16:02.000
So yeah. And then lastly, I'm the only developer currently.

125
0:16:02.000 --> 0:16:07.000
So, you know, code developed in isolation isn't reviewed as thoroughly as it could be.

126
0:16:07.000 --> 0:16:13.000
So, you know, yeah, I make design choices based on what I think is appropriate.

127
0:16:13.000 --> 0:16:23.000
So. Yeah. So last thing too is that, you know, testing framework, I think is a lot cooler than the video that I kind of struggled to play here.

128
0:16:23.000 --> 0:16:26.000
So if you want to scan the QR code, if you're interested, feel free.

129
0:16:26.000 --> 0:16:31.000
Slides are also online as well. So if you're not available right now, you can check it out.

130
0:16:31.000 --> 0:16:37.000
And then lastly, you know, this is kind of a, you know, call for involvement.

131
0:16:37.000 --> 0:16:43.000
So, you know, really, at Canonical, we're trying to start getting Ubuntu kind of geared better for HPC.

132
0:16:43.000 --> 0:16:48.000
We kind of know that we're a little bit behind Red Hat in the case of like network driver support and whatnot.

133
0:16:48.000 --> 0:16:54.000
So, you know, just if you're interested in using Ubuntu for your workflows and whatnot, we have a public mattermost channel.

134
0:16:54.000 --> 0:16:57.000
So you can scan that QR code or you can check it out later.

135
0:16:57.000 --> 0:17:02.000
But yeah, we have a public channel for HPC online.

136
0:17:02.000 --> 0:17:11.000
So yeah, if there's something that's missing or, you know, there's kind of some reason why you're being held back on using Ubuntu for HPC, we really love to hear that feedback.

137
0:17:11.000 --> 0:17:22.000
So yeah, that's it.

138
0:17:22.000 --> 0:17:27.000
Any questions for Jason? Last chance for today.

139
0:17:27.000 --> 0:17:33.000
So how you're just doing this is all Python code that builds this system for you. Yes. Yes.

140
0:17:33.000 --> 0:17:35.000
So how are you spinning up the LXD containers?

141
0:17:35.000 --> 0:17:44.000
So the idea is that in the case of LXD, it has a public API socket that uses things like open API standard or something.

142
0:17:44.000 --> 0:17:58.000
But yeah, so you can make like HTTP requests out to that API that basically say like, oh, you know, I need this instance or tear this down or set this configuration so I can install like app tanner some other container hypervisor inside of LXD.

143
0:17:58.000 --> 0:18:03.000
Why not say yes. I'm just using the API.

144
0:18:03.000 --> 0:18:11.000
Any other questions?

145
0:18:11.000 --> 0:18:14.000
So yeah, I'm interested in this.

146
0:18:14.000 --> 0:18:19.000
What so the like the you had an NFS server and some other stuff.

147
0:18:19.000 --> 0:18:22.000
Are you how are you are this pre assembled images that you're just using?

148
0:18:22.000 --> 0:18:27.000
Are you building up with some kind of configuration management to use Ansible development?

149
0:18:27.000 --> 0:18:37.000
Yeah. So currently what I have is like the way that I provision I'm using like base Ubuntu images for configuration right now.

150
0:18:37.000 --> 0:18:41.000
But you do have the ability to register your own custom instances and pull them in as well.

151
0:18:41.000 --> 0:18:49.000
But basically I have a little mechanism built into the framework where you can write like provisioning scripts using like the clean test utilities.

152
0:18:49.000 --> 0:18:55.000
So there's some stuff for like installing apps running commands on like sub processes on the unit.

153
0:18:55.000 --> 0:18:58.000
And then also like you can reach out to the network download anything you need.

154
0:18:58.000 --> 0:19:03.000
So yeah, I'm just using custom Python scripts to provision that are yes.

155
0:19:03.000 --> 0:19:09.000
Yes.

156
0:19:09.000 --> 0:19:15.000
Anyone else last chance there.

157
0:19:15.000 --> 0:19:19.000
It's for the stream and the recording.

158
0:19:19.000 --> 0:19:23.000
We've been doing well all day. Let's keep it up.

159
0:19:23.000 --> 0:19:30.000
What do you might please to move to the previous slide so I can scan my QR code correctly.

160
0:19:30.000 --> 0:19:34.000
Okay. Thank you very much.

161
0:19:34.000 --> 0:19:37.000
That was a good last question. The other one.

162
0:19:37.000 --> 0:19:42.000
Which one are you looking for this one or okay.

163
0:19:42.000 --> 0:19:47.000
That's all right. There's no more questions we can wrap up here.

164
0:19:47.000 --> 0:19:50.000
Thanks a lot everyone. That was a wrap for today.

165
0:19:50.000 --> 0:19:56.000
The 98 PC dev room at false them. That means it falls them like says we can have a tent one next year.

166
0:19:56.000 --> 0:20:06.000
That would be really nice. So practical stuff if you're leaving the room if you see any trash please take it with you and dump it in an appropriate place outside.

167
0:20:06.000 --> 0:20:13.000
And the false them team has asked us to ask you to leave the building as soon as possible so they can lock up the whole building.

168
0:20:13.000 --> 0:20:19.000
There's another talk going on in Janssen and the really big room. I would recommend going there.

169
0:20:19.000 --> 0:20:27.000
It's a really nice way to wrap up false them and there will be places there to get one or maybe two or three more beers and have some more chats with people.

170
0:20:27.000 --> 0:20:55.000
Thanks a lot and hopefully see you next year.
