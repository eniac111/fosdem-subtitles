00:00.000 --> 00:11.800
So, hey everyone. My name is Mathieu Tasse. I'm a software engineer. This talk is about

00:11.800 --> 00:18.440
retrospective of my last year when it comes to hardware development. So, my background

00:18.440 --> 00:24.840
is that I do a lot of C programming. I've been doing so for the last ten years. Kernel

00:24.840 --> 00:33.480
drivers, libraries, mostly on Linux. So, with Yocto, all of that mostly for profit because

00:33.480 --> 00:42.320
you get to make a living. And I've also been hacking on more fun stuff like guide, do-geeks,

00:42.320 --> 00:50.600
functional stuff for fun this time. And to me, up to last year, hardware was more or

00:50.600 --> 00:57.480
less like a black box. I mean, I was familiar with the surface of the box, which are data

00:57.480 --> 01:06.480
sheets, manuals, schematics. But what's inside of it wasn't that interesting to me. If I

01:06.480 --> 01:13.640
had something harder than finding out a GPIO number or, yeah, any kind of trouble, I found

01:13.640 --> 01:24.360
my hardware colleague drop the ball and move on. But last year, almost randomly, I discovered

01:24.360 --> 01:31.000
the world of hardware repair and micro soldering on YouTube. And it's a fun world. There are

01:31.000 --> 01:36.560
some really, really talented people which are repairing some stuff. They are finding

01:36.560 --> 01:44.200
the one tiny capacitor that is failing, removing it, and just by buying some one zero zero

01:44.200 --> 01:54.920
one cent capacitor, you are fixing a border. I found that quite interesting. I think that

01:54.920 --> 02:02.040
the world would be really different maybe in 20, 30 years, and having this kind of subset

02:02.040 --> 02:08.640
could be interesting. And at the same time, I had a project where I was involved in the

02:08.640 --> 02:18.680
design of a motherboard for an Intel CPU. As the hardware guy was a bit busy, I was

02:18.680 --> 02:27.880
somehow against my will involved in the hardware selection. And so I learned that it's more

02:27.880 --> 02:35.440
or less picking out ICs, which means integrated circuits. It's like often a tiny black box

02:35.440 --> 02:40.000
and you have to pick one. You have to pick one that is not out of stock and it's challenging

02:40.000 --> 02:48.400
these times. And once you pick two or some that maybe will ship, then you need to draw

02:48.400 --> 02:54.640
the wires between them. And it was quite a fun exercise. And it gave me the motivation

02:54.640 --> 02:59.920
to acquire some tools because one of the difference between software and hardware is that with

02:59.920 --> 03:05.440
software, well, you can have your laptop and work everywhere. With hardware, my experience

03:05.440 --> 03:11.680
is that it's not only that you need some tools, it's that you need all the tools. Like if

03:11.680 --> 03:17.240
you don't have everything, you will still have something missing and you'll be, oh no.

03:17.240 --> 03:23.760
And so this is about how to turn your desk into a terrible mess. So first you need to

03:23.760 --> 03:32.360
buy a microscope. You don't need a times 5,000 zoom. 540 is way than enough. You need some

03:32.360 --> 03:38.680
LED lightening so that you're able to see what's your under that. And it's quite a fun

03:38.680 --> 03:44.280
exercise to learn to solder under a microscope and it's nice to use. Then you need obviously

03:44.280 --> 03:49.560
a soldering iron. Most of you are familiar with it. You need a hot station. It's maybe

03:49.560 --> 03:56.000
even more important than the soldering iron. You use that to dissolve some ices, the tiny

03:56.000 --> 04:03.080
black things. We soldered them. But it's difficult to manage because it's blowing 400 degrees

04:03.080 --> 04:08.920
air so it's easy to mess everything. Burn your board. You need a generator to power

04:08.920 --> 04:21.080
your board. You need a telescope to be able to see your signals. You need also a breadboard

04:21.080 --> 04:28.560
so that you're able to experiment. Try out some things. You need some components, some

04:28.560 --> 04:34.040
resistors, some capacitors, some indexes. As I said, it's nice to have all of those

04:34.040 --> 04:37.480
so that when you are trying out something, you don't need to wait for two weeks, five

04:37.480 --> 04:43.640
weeks to experiment. You need a multimeter. You don't need a fancy one. It's like a two

04:43.640 --> 04:51.720
U

04:51.720 --> 04:57.720
UOS multimeter. The main function is that when you connect the probes, it beeps. It sounds

04:57.720 --> 05:02.120
funny, but with that, you can reverse engineer some tiny circuits. You can isolate some issues.

05:02.120 --> 05:14.320
You can do a lot of stuff. You need some flux so that the solder is able to flow nicely.

05:14.320 --> 05:22.680
It's probably very toxic and as healthy as eating lead for breakfast. Maybe you also

05:22.680 --> 05:30.640
need some kind of human extractor. I need to improve mine because... You need also some

05:30.640 --> 05:35.880
solder week or solder pump so that you're able to remove the solder when you have made

05:35.880 --> 05:41.240
some mistakes. You need some tweezers. More than that, you need to learn how to use them

05:41.240 --> 05:51.200
because when you are dealing with O4O2 components, they like to jump to the end of the room.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.840
Quite a fun exercise. You need a perf board so that once you have a circuit on your breadboard,

05:56.840 --> 06:04.640
you can make it more permanent. You need some wires to wire things, obviously. If you have

06:04.640 --> 06:08.480
a two dollar multimeter, then you probably also need an RLC meter so that you're able

06:08.480 --> 06:20.840
to find the values of your components. Last O, I felt like I needed... I have a software

06:20.840 --> 06:26.720
engineer. I did some hardware at school, but not so much. I felt like I needed some kind

06:26.720 --> 06:31.360
of reference book. When it comes to software, to me, it's like it's SICP, Structured and

06:31.360 --> 06:36.640
Interpretation of Computer Programs. It feels to me like a novel. It's like a Stephen King

06:36.640 --> 06:44.160
Moon novel. I can read it. I felt so entertaining. I asked, like, how can you use what's the reference

06:44.160 --> 06:51.120
book for hardware? People tell me it's the art of electronics. I can just say that it's

06:51.120 --> 06:56.920
a whole different deal here, to me at least. Reading more than two or three pages gives

06:56.920 --> 07:02.880
me horrible headaches. It's a reference book. You will find some more in-depth explanations

07:02.880 --> 07:14.320
on electronics like overflow. When I acquired all that equipment, I tried to design some

07:14.320 --> 07:19.920
easy circuits. This one is a flash programming device on a perf board so that you are able

07:19.920 --> 07:25.720
to put your IC on the socket on the left-hand corner and then able to flash it with flash

07:25.720 --> 07:32.320
run. That was my third circuit. Then I managed to make a few repairs. I had a zero percent

07:32.320 --> 07:39.120
success rate for like three months. Then I did hit two percent success rate by fixing

07:39.120 --> 07:50.120
my coffee machine. Since then, I managed to fix quite a few things. I also managed to

07:50.120 --> 07:57.960
hack a bias. It was a nice thing. I had a laptop with password protected bias. I tried

07:57.960 --> 08:03.840
to remove the bias, which is the DIC there. I burnt it to ashes. I bought another one

08:03.840 --> 08:09.680
that I still burnt to ashes, about the third one. I flashed it with the device you saw

08:09.680 --> 08:16.680
with flash run, put a bias without the password, managed to solder it back on with the hottest

08:16.680 --> 08:24.280
station I thought about. Then it wasn't working because I also managed to glue some couple

08:24.280 --> 08:30.960
traces. Then I had to run some wires. At the end, the notebook booted. It's not much, but

08:30.960 --> 08:42.040
it was quite a success to me. Then finally, I did try to get into PCB design. I have a

08:42.040 --> 08:47.880
LED ribbon around my desk and I tried to make it remote controllable. I designed the PCB.

08:47.880 --> 08:54.800
It's the worst use case you can even think of, but you get to start somewhere. I designed

08:54.800 --> 09:02.560
a PCB on keycard with a CPU that was really fun to solder, a regulator, USB port, nothing

09:02.560 --> 09:12.600
fancy. I found both software, I found keycard really fun to use. It was easy to draw the

09:12.600 --> 09:20.040
schematics to make the routing even without any experience. Really nice software. I tried

09:20.040 --> 09:28.560
to use the new keycard for my next design because the name sounds appealing. It was

09:28.560 --> 09:35.240
quite an interesting process. That's it. The takeaway message is that even if you are 100

09:35.240 --> 09:40.760
percent software engineer and you don't want to get into hardware, having a minimal set

09:40.760 --> 09:49.080
of equipment and minimal set of knowledge allows you to do some fun stuff and tries

09:49.080 --> 09:53.040
to connect you to your hardware colleagues, which is a good thing in my opinion. Thank

09:53.040 --> 09:54.040
you.
