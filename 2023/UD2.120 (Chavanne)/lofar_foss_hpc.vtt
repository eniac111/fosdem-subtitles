WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
We are ready for the next talk by Courtney, who is going to talk about open source radio

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
astronomy.

00:18.880 --> 00:19.880
Hi, everyone.

00:19.880 --> 00:25.600
I work for Ostrone, which is the Dutch Institute for Radio Astronomy.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.440
We are a government institute, so we are publicly funded.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.600
Apart from being publicly funded, we have a lot of research grants, and that's basically

00:34.600 --> 00:36.600
what pays my salary.

00:36.600 --> 00:42.040
I'm going to talk about our biggest instrument that we have, which is called LOFAR, and we

00:42.040 --> 00:46.120
actually utilize a lot of open source software there, almost exclusively.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.000
There are some caveats.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.320
My name is Courtney Luecker, by the way.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.720
I am also into amateur radio.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.840
My call sign is Papa Delta 3 Sierra Uniform.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.600
This is going to be quite a relaxed talk.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.920
We're going to give a high-level overview of all the different components that are there.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.920
There's quite a lot of them, actually, so it's not possible to go into detail with the

01:04.920 --> 01:05.920
time we have.

01:05.920 --> 01:11.840
This is my first post-em talk ever, and also my first talk ever in a lecture hall, so that's

01:11.840 --> 01:13.720
quite interesting.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.760
Now, some background.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.440
I mentioned that we are a government institute.

01:18.440 --> 01:23.160
We firmly believe public money means public code, and we stand by that in almost everything

01:23.160 --> 01:25.040
we do already.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.120
We have an open source committee that also ensures that we do that, and we have basically

01:29.120 --> 01:30.840
two very big telescopes.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.160
One's called LOFAR, which stands for low frequency array, and the other is the Westerbork Synthetist

01:36.160 --> 01:39.440
Telescope, also called WSRT.

01:39.440 --> 01:45.000
There's some sister institutes that we work closely with or are related to us.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.520
One is called COMRAS, which maintains a telescope that we've stopped using, and the others are

01:50.520 --> 01:51.640
JIVE and EVN.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.760
I'm not going to talk too much about those today.

01:54.760 --> 01:59.640
What I want to show you is that there is this principle that our radio telescopes work on

01:59.640 --> 02:05.720
that is called very long baseline interferometry, and this enables us to do radio astronomy

02:05.720 --> 02:11.560
in a way that wasn't possible with traditional radio telescopes.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.160
This is the whole map of LOFAR.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.920
There's 54 stations in total.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.880
Roughly 25 of those are located in the Netherlands.

02:18.880 --> 02:24.320
I say it's around 2,000 kilometres in diameter, but that's no longer true because the one

02:24.320 --> 02:30.000
in Rosen is new and we're now about 2,500 kilometres in diameter.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.480
This diameter is also called the baseline, which is where the very long baseline interferometry

02:35.480 --> 02:36.480
comes from.

02:36.480 --> 02:43.200
If we then zoom into a station, you see all these tiles, and you see these little squares.

02:43.200 --> 02:50.040
Those are the different types of antenna, and that is what makes this type of radio

02:50.040 --> 02:54.720
astronomy so interesting, is that we don't have a single antenna to catch radio waves.

02:54.720 --> 03:00.760
We have lots of them, about 20,000 in total, actually, which is quite substantial.

03:00.760 --> 03:07.240
This centre is called the SuperTurb, and it's located in Ex-Lode, the Netherlands.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.160
How can we actually combine this data?

03:09.160 --> 03:14.800
I told you that traditional radio astronomy relies on a parabolic dish or a single antenna,

03:14.800 --> 03:17.800
and we try to scale those up, make them bigger and bigger.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.360
Of course, physics are at the limits at some point.

03:20.360 --> 03:25.120
You can't make a structure from steel that's like 500 metres in diameter.

03:25.120 --> 03:33.440
What we do instead is we combine smaller antennas to act as if they are a parabolic antenna.

03:33.440 --> 03:38.120
The trick about a parabolic antenna is that all radio waves, no matter where they are

03:38.120 --> 03:42.600
incoming from, they all have an equal distance to the receiver.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.520
We need to emulate that with our antennas.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.400
We do that in two ways.

03:47.400 --> 03:52.920
There is an artificial delay, an analogue artificial delay, by just making the line

03:52.920 --> 03:57.960
that it needs to travel across on the PCB or the coax cable longer, but we can also

03:57.960 --> 04:01.920
do it digitally after the data is being sampled.

04:01.920 --> 04:07.440
Then we can aim into the sky and create a very narrow beam that observes a very small

04:07.440 --> 04:09.320
portion of the sky.

04:09.320 --> 04:16.520
That allows us to zoom really deep into space and make very detailed images.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.820
But what is this radio waves actually?

04:18.820 --> 04:19.820
What are those?

04:19.820 --> 04:20.820
What are we observing?

04:20.820 --> 04:25.760
There are two types of radio waves that are being emitted by objects in space and the

04:25.760 --> 04:26.760
galaxy.

04:26.760 --> 04:31.440
We're only going to describe one phenomena today that's called synchrotron radiation.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.680
Basically, if you have an ion, a charged particle, and you accelerate that, then it starts creating

04:36.680 --> 04:38.600
radio wave emissions.

04:38.600 --> 04:44.280
The frequency and the intensity at the frequency that is actually very dependent, that's all

04:44.280 --> 04:47.400
details that are not very interesting for this talk.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.440
But one of these entities that emit these types of charged particles are sometimes black

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
holes.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.520
We'll see an example of that at the end.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.960
I mentioned black holes.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.040
There's other types of radio astronomy that are very interesting.

05:01.040 --> 05:06.360
We can also model our own ionosphere, so there's more enlightening.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.480
Stars are pretty interesting.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.080
These are stars that are rotating at a periodic interval.

05:11.080 --> 05:16.800
They have very strong radio waves coming from the poles of those stars.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.200
What does Loewe actually look like?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.640
It's a very small antenna, as I told you.

05:20.640 --> 05:25.200
We can see on the left that there's wires attached to those poles.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.420
Those are actually dipole antennas.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.800
If you configure them like this, where they are like a V shape, they are called inverted

05:31.800 --> 05:33.000
V's.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.160
These are the low band antennas.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.920
On the right side, you see the high band antennas.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.720
They're like a clover shape, like a tie shape.

05:41.720 --> 05:48.600
Then we combine all these low band antennas and 69 high band antennas in a station, and

05:48.600 --> 05:53.440
we send the data at around 3 gigabits per second to our HPC clusters.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.240
There's a two-phase cluster here.

05:55.240 --> 06:00.160
The first is GPU processing, where we do correlation and beamforming.

06:00.160 --> 06:06.480
The second is central processing, which is more like CPU based.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.440
In the early days, our computing cluster looked something like this.

06:11.440 --> 06:17.120
We had IBM BlueJeans machines, which were based on PowerPC, and they had a 3D Torus

06:17.120 --> 06:22.160
interconnect, which is actually quite interesting interconnect.

06:22.160 --> 06:27.240
This was problematic because utilizing the floating point vector extensions required

06:27.240 --> 06:31.920
manually rewriting assembly, which wasn't that nice and was pretty hard to find developers

06:31.920 --> 06:35.000
who were willing or capable to do that.

06:35.000 --> 06:46.960
We moved to commodity hardware, two CPUs per socket, two sockets per server, two GPUs per

06:46.960 --> 06:51.520
server, lots of networking.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.960
That is really what you see here.

06:53.960 --> 07:00.360
We had 32 gigabytes of 10 gigabit Ethernet, and then in 2018, when we upgraded, we had

07:00.360 --> 07:07.960
24 times or 23 times of 100 gigabits in FiniBand, but you also see that there's a lot of 10

07:07.960 --> 07:10.360
gigabit Ethernet per device.

07:10.360 --> 07:16.440
I'm going to go into that while it is in a minute.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.360
If you look at the data flow or more like a software site, then you see that the antennas

07:22.360 --> 07:28.800
have ADC, so these convert the analog waves that are incoming to digital signals, and

07:28.800 --> 07:35.840
then we do beamforming on the stations, and we send data to the correlator.

07:35.840 --> 07:43.000
This correlator also does the correlation afterwards.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.160
You can see that once the correlator is done with it, we store this to disk, and once it's

07:48.160 --> 07:52.880
stored on disk, then it's made available to the central processing.

07:52.880 --> 07:58.400
The correlator and our GPU cluster, Cobalt, are doing streaming, and the central processing

07:58.400 --> 08:02.720
is more like your traditional HPC.

08:02.720 --> 08:07.160
When we look at the data flow in Cobalt, there's all this incoming 10 gigabit Ethernet, and

08:07.160 --> 08:13.760
this is why we have four or three 10 gigabit Ethernet links per Cobalt server.

08:13.760 --> 08:19.120
They are streaming the data, and we configure a per station where it needs to send its data

08:19.120 --> 08:20.120
to.

08:20.120 --> 08:28.520
Then, once it's there, it's being transposed at roughly 240 gigabits, and once it's transposed,

08:28.520 --> 08:32.340
we do have two pipelines that essentially run in parallel.

08:32.340 --> 08:35.680
One is correlation, and one is additional beamforming.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.280
We actually beamform twice in a sense.

08:38.280 --> 08:43.000
It's a little bit more complicated than I'm sketching here, but I'm keeping things simple

08:43.000 --> 08:48.920
because stations also have the capability to not beamform and send un-beamform data.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.880
We have a special buffer that's called the transient buffer, where we dump raw samples

08:52.880 --> 09:00.160
and can send those two clusters, but the general pipeline is what I'm sketching here.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.760
If I zoom into these two pipelines, the correlator pipeline and the beamformer pipeline, I don't

09:05.760 --> 09:09.700
want you to look at the details too much here because that's not interesting and I really

09:09.700 --> 09:12.080
don't have time to explain it.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.320
The trick is almost everything you see here is based on signal processing, digital signal

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
processing.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.840
That's what we're doing.

09:19.840 --> 09:25.120
We're using the fast Fourier transform, finite input response filters, and transforming the

09:25.120 --> 09:30.160
data in the frequency domain, if you will.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.200
Then it's put back into CPU memory at Cobalt.

09:34.200 --> 09:38.320
Some final transformations are being placed, and then it's put into the disk so that CEP

09:38.320 --> 09:41.360
can work on it.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.440
At Ostrone, we do a lot with software, and I've showed you now how the data flows, but

09:47.440 --> 09:52.680
I haven't told you what software components are making that data flow happen.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.600
For Cobalt, it's actually one solid product that lives in the Loafer repository.

09:58.600 --> 10:04.960
Please don't all now visit or get lab instance at once because it will die if you do that.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.560
Try to spread that out a little bit over the day.

10:08.560 --> 10:17.000
I'm sure I will upload the slides soon after, so you don't have to remember all this.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.920
All these tools that are listed here, except for Cobalt with lives in the Loafer repo,

10:22.920 --> 10:26.480
those are more like what you would find on the CEP side of things.

10:26.480 --> 10:32.400
I'm going to explain, I want to address that this is just the tip of the iceberg.

10:32.400 --> 10:37.440
On our GitHub repo, you can find a lot of more stuff that you can play with, and I would

10:37.440 --> 10:40.480
encourage you to do so because it's quite interesting.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.320
Then there's also CasaCore, which is heavily being developed at Ostrone as well, but it's

10:45.320 --> 10:48.240
not actually just a product just by us.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.280
A competitor or like a friend of CasaCore would be Ostropy.

10:52.280 --> 10:58.840
Very widely known packages in the industry.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.280
If you look at the radio astronomy toolkit, so the necessary things to go from antenna

11:03.280 --> 11:06.960
to image, if you will, then these are your friends.

11:06.960 --> 11:15.320
There's DP cubed, W clean, and IDG, and Rattler, AO flagger, and I'm not going to talk too

11:15.320 --> 11:17.120
much about every beam.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.000
What do these things do?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.480
What are we looking at here?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.400
DP cubed is where you define a complete pipeline.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.800
You have the incoming data, you need to do some transformations on the data, maybe you

11:27.800 --> 11:34.320
want to identify some noise sources that might be in your data, and eventually you want to

11:34.320 --> 11:38.200
create an image, and for this imaging you need deconvolution as well.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.320
You also need gridding and degridding.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.040
AO flagger is where you identify noise sources.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.840
This can be anything.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.160
Radio instruments are very sensitive.

11:48.160 --> 11:54.360
One noise source in particular would be electric fences, windmills, solar farms, bed quality

11:54.360 --> 11:58.120
LED lighting.

11:58.120 --> 12:04.880
Then we move to the imaging part with W clean, because when you have a radio telescope consisting

12:04.880 --> 12:11.840
of many small antennas, in between your antennas there are holes, and that means that you're

12:11.840 --> 12:16.080
not receiving the data as if you would have a very large parabolic dish.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.600
There's some differences.

12:17.600 --> 12:23.640
This creates some kind of fringing in the image that you need to filter out, and that's

12:23.640 --> 12:28.440
what the W clean together with RATLAR and IDG are doing.

12:28.440 --> 12:36.520
In IDG is your translation from the data domain to a domain that is useful for radio astronomical

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
imaging.

12:37.520 --> 12:43.800
I talked a little bit about CasaCore, now it was industry widely used.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.840
It's based on all the packages that have been around for a very long time, but we've actually

12:48.840 --> 12:55.080
switched to the route now, so now CasaCore is built on top of these other packages rather

12:55.080 --> 12:59.560
than CasaCore depending on these other packages.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.280
There's several unique features here.

13:02.280 --> 13:09.800
The UV domain is pretty interesting, so that's the domain about the plane that is filled,

13:09.800 --> 13:16.560
so those holes in your surface area, if you will.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.840
There's some Python bindings here, so these are all very nice tools that you can just

13:20.840 --> 13:23.880
play with.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.880
We also use a lot of open source tools, and we're doing quite well.

13:27.880 --> 13:32.600
There's still some close source software, I'll get into that in a minute.

13:32.600 --> 13:40.200
We use OpenMPI, OpenMP, SLURM, GitLab, Grafana, and actually the part that I work on is PyTangle,

13:40.200 --> 13:42.360
which is a SCADA system.

13:42.360 --> 13:47.320
With supervisory control and data acquisition, that's basically your interface that we have

13:47.320 --> 13:49.880
on the individual stations.

13:49.880 --> 13:56.240
Those stations then configure underlying hardware with the antennas and the ADCs, and they report

13:56.240 --> 14:00.920
how they are configured to a higher level system.

14:00.920 --> 14:07.000
We also use Prometheus, Docker, and a variety of interesting open source tools.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.080
This is just the tip of the iceberg as well, there's much more.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.520
Next to our SEP cluster is also pretty interesting, which is actually very useful, and we also

14:16.520 --> 14:23.800
have a dust disk cluster, which is a cluster shared with many universities within the country.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.520
Things where we can improve.

14:25.520 --> 14:33.160
Well, we use CUDA, so that's not really open source compared to OpenCL or Falcon.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.880
We're using WinCC for monitoring.

14:35.880 --> 14:41.360
Maybe you've heard of that package, it's Windows-based, hence why it's called WinCC.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.920
We're trying to face that out for Gervana and Prometheus.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.800
That's going quite well, I'd say.

14:47.800 --> 14:53.880
We have a lot of closed source SPEDA fender blocks, so if you have your Xilinx or your

14:53.880 --> 15:01.360
Altera, then they, for instance, offer IP blocks to implement 100 gigabit internet interfaces,

15:01.360 --> 15:06.800
and they're not too keen on you sharing those with the whole wide world.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.040
Then InfiniBand firmware is pretty closed source.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.960
I believe there's open source versions of that, but I don't think I know if they work

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
quite well.

15:13.960 --> 15:21.440
Then the main area that we're actually struggling is with office management tools.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.640
This is definitely the area that we can improve the most at Ostrone.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.680
We use Office 365, Slack, and Zoom.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.480
As you can see, Kupan, Omato, Moast, Jitsi, there's definitely open source alternatives

15:31.480 --> 15:36.040
to this, so there's no real reason why we should be using this.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.560
Of course, you need to host the infrastructure, and that also costs money, so there's some

15:40.560 --> 15:41.560
little way there.

15:41.560 --> 15:46.880
I'm not saying that it's definitely cheaper, but there's open source alternatives to this.

15:46.880 --> 15:52.160
Now I want to show you, I told you about IDG that does the gridding and de-gridding.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.880
I told you about VSWClean and the Dravata part that does the deconvolution now, and

15:57.880 --> 16:01.760
I want to show you how those tools work in practice.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.820
We have an ideal point source.

16:03.820 --> 16:07.880
This is our most ideal radio source that can possibly exist.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.840
It creates a very sharp point in the sky.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.440
We put it toward the gridding, and we get a point function.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.840
What this basically is, is this is the error of our telescope.

16:17.840 --> 16:23.200
We now know, okay, this is the error it's going to generate in our images, because we

16:23.200 --> 16:25.520
don't have complete filling of the UV plane.

16:25.520 --> 16:31.440
There are holes in between our antennae, and then we can use the VSWClean image together

16:31.440 --> 16:37.320
with Radler for deconvolution to create an iterative process in which we iteratively

16:37.320 --> 16:40.360
remove the noise from the image.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.520
Actually I'm going to see...

16:41.520 --> 16:44.240
Oh yeah, that's nice.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.000
Here you see these lines.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.760
These lines are the fringes that I've told, and if you then perform these iterative cleaning

16:51.760 --> 16:57.780
process on what are called calibrated visibilities, then we iteratively see that this image is

16:57.780 --> 16:59.880
drastically improved.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.880
Now, some example of this.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.560
What is the science that we do with LoFAR?

17:05.560 --> 17:06.960
How does this look like?

17:06.960 --> 17:13.320
Well, this is a paper by Eric Timmerman, so you can look at it when you spare time.

17:13.320 --> 17:18.240
What we're basically seeing here is we're seeing huge jets of these synchrotron radiation

17:18.240 --> 17:20.400
emissions that are talked about.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.320
You can see that they actually over millions of years, they vary in intensity.

17:25.320 --> 17:29.080
At the center of this image is actually a black hole, but you can't see that because

17:29.080 --> 17:30.600
it's a black hole.

17:30.600 --> 17:37.240
And then on the background of this image, there is an overlay of what's the optical

17:37.240 --> 17:42.040
domain, so not the radio domain, from the Hubble Space Telescope.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.440
This is what we've been able to capture with LoFAR.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.120
So we're doing groundbreaking science, and we're going to do a lot more.

17:49.120 --> 17:53.720
We're in the middle of a big upgrade that's scheduled for the end of 2014.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.760
WinCEC is going to be replaced with Kefana.

17:55.760 --> 18:01.840
We're thinking about Olerta, but I've heard that Kefana has persistent alarms during actually

18:01.840 --> 18:05.520
for STEM today, so we might not need Olerta.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.440
And we're using Prometheus.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.160
We had these low-band antennas, and the high-band antennas.

18:10.160 --> 18:16.760
I briefly skimped over that because the details, yeah, you have to cut some corners somewhere.

18:16.760 --> 18:21.960
But basically with LoFAR 2, we'll be able to use both of them in a single observation.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.680
We'll also be able to use multiple beams, so I talked about the beam forming currently.

18:26.680 --> 18:30.440
LoFAR is only able to have a single beam per observation.

18:30.440 --> 18:37.760
And we will also be able to point at different points in the sky, change that during an observation.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.040
And we call this Mega Mode.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.040
Don't ask me why.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.440
Yeah, we're completely refamping the SCADA system.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.440
We're now using Patango.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.720
We have sufficiently upgraded hardware, Unibore 2s.

18:49.720 --> 18:54.680
We actually sell those to external institutes as well, so they're available.

18:54.680 --> 18:59.680
And we're drastically improving the timing distribution, so we're currently GPS-based.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.120
Everything is synchronized using GPS, all the stations across Europe.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.160
And we're going to use the White Rabbit protocol that's made by CERN.

19:07.160 --> 19:11.040
That's based on the Precision Time protocol.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.040
Now very briefly, this Mega Mode, what would this schematically look like?

19:15.040 --> 19:20.160
So this is basically what's running on Cobalt or GPU cluster, and we do imaging and beam

19:20.160 --> 19:21.160
forming.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.080
And now we have one beam and several pointings.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.880
And they stay the same during observations.

19:27.880 --> 19:32.960
Now we can have multiple beams, and we can re-point during the observation.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.600
That's going to create a lot of flexibility for the astronomers, and I'm going to be very

19:36.600 --> 19:40.600
excited with the science that is going to come from this.

19:40.600 --> 19:47.480
I want to leave you with some links, as mentioned, our Ostrone repo, the Ostrone website.

19:47.480 --> 19:52.200
There's a very interesting page about 10 years of LOFR, because we've actually existed,

19:52.200 --> 19:57.040
LOFR has been in production since 2008, so that's been since quite some time.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.880
There's this very nice map on which you can actually see all the physical locations of

20:00.880 --> 20:06.440
all the stations, how many antennas are active or working or broken.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.900
So this is all open data.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.960
You can just look at this, and there's some history about all these presentations that

20:11.960 --> 20:14.200
have done in the past.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.360
So any questions?

20:17.360 --> 20:23.520
Any questions for Poutet?

20:23.520 --> 20:37.160
I see one.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.920
We first a short comment.

20:39.920 --> 20:46.320
The Chinese built a 500-meter dish, but that's just...

20:46.320 --> 20:51.560
But what I really wanted to ask is whether you have collaboration with other astrophysical

20:51.560 --> 20:55.640
observations like square kilometer array or something like that?

20:55.640 --> 21:01.080
Well actually we collaborate on the square kilometer array, so there's definitely...

21:01.080 --> 21:05.720
Can you repeat part of your question, because people were just leaving?

21:05.720 --> 21:10.160
Well, whether there is shared development in software and stuff?

21:10.160 --> 21:11.480
Yeah, for sure.

21:11.480 --> 21:16.680
For instance on CasaCore, as I mentioned, but also WSClean, we see contributions from

21:16.680 --> 21:26.600
external collaborators, and especially the part of Jive that I showed at the very beginning.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.360
Let me see.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.480
Shouldn't be too long.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.240
So here I mentioned Jive and EPN.

21:34.240 --> 21:39.000
This is a huge collaboration of parabolic dishes that are all connected, and all the

21:39.000 --> 21:49.200
data centrally to Dringalo at the headquarters of Asturong.

21:49.200 --> 21:53.720
And that's actually where the EPN network processes all this data.

21:53.720 --> 21:58.480
But all these dishes that we use, those are not ours, right?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.480
Those are from other parties.

22:00.480 --> 22:07.840
Another question from the Jack and Ralph.

22:07.840 --> 22:13.560
Someone's asking, since everything's processed digitally, can these telescopes focus on multiple

22:13.560 --> 22:18.000
targets at once by processing the data multiple times?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.880
That's an interesting question, and that depends.

22:20.880 --> 22:25.080
As I said, you have to transient buffers, which dump raw samples.

22:25.080 --> 22:29.840
But typically what we do is we already do beamforming on the station.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.080
And if you do the beamforming on the station, you're already looking at some point in the

22:33.080 --> 22:34.080
sky.

22:34.080 --> 22:38.720
You're only sending the result data from that beamforming to this cobalt cluster, and you

22:38.720 --> 22:40.520
can't beamform again then.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.520
The data is lost.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.160
It's reductive in nature.

22:43.160 --> 22:48.640
But if you would send the raw sample data to cobalt, and it could somehow process all

22:48.640 --> 22:56.160
the data, which I don't think it has the bandwidth to do so, then you could, at a later point

22:56.160 --> 23:00.800
in time, point at any point in the sky again.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.120
That's the job of the transient buffers.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.160
Thanks.

23:06.160 --> 23:11.840
Maybe a question here.

23:11.840 --> 23:20.040
Would there be any ways or interests for amateur astronomers or radio astronomers, of course,

23:20.040 --> 23:26.280
to help or work with astronomy?

23:26.280 --> 23:31.400
Well, there's definitely job positions on our page all the time, I think.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.960
I don't know if most are in the field of radio astronomy, but what typically happens, and

23:35.960 --> 23:41.280
I can briefly explain, is we have a system called NordStar in which astronomers submit

23:41.280 --> 23:45.400
their proposals and describe what they want to do with their instrument.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.960
And then we have a community that looks at that, and that actually accepts these proposals,

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
and then they are scheduled.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.880
This is actually a very good question, because I completely skipped this in the talk, but

23:54.880 --> 23:56.720
I wanted to talk about this.

23:56.720 --> 24:01.880
And then things are scheduled in a system called TMS, and that basically looks at, okay,

24:01.880 --> 24:08.520
what part of these stations are required to do these observations and collect these data.

24:08.520 --> 24:12.440
Then these data are collected and processed on cobalt and sap, and the data products are

24:12.440 --> 24:16.360
made available to these individual astronomers who've done that, and they get exclusive access

24:16.360 --> 24:20.200
for a period of time to do their research.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.200
Okay, thanks.

24:21.200 --> 24:31.160
I was more thinking about just if someone is like in Africa with a homemade dish, is

24:31.160 --> 24:38.960
there any way to maybe capture something with an SDR and add a little bit to this data,

24:38.960 --> 24:42.400
or the scale of things is so different that...

24:42.400 --> 24:47.080
It's actually very important, or it's rather we need to model a lot of things and calibrate

24:47.080 --> 24:48.440
a lot of things.

24:48.440 --> 24:54.000
So that's why all the stations are roughly similar in shape, have similar hardware, so

24:54.000 --> 24:58.600
it would be definitely possible to buy your own station, build your own station, and have

24:58.600 --> 25:00.480
the same hardware, and then hook it up.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.720
That happens all the time.

25:02.720 --> 25:06.360
Different countries do that, buy stations, and then we add them.

25:06.360 --> 25:11.160
But having very fastly different hardware and then hooking this up to this system would

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
be very difficult.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.440
It's not designed to do that.

25:13.440 --> 25:21.720
Okay, so if you would make a very cheap station that could be built by amateur astronomers,

25:21.720 --> 25:27.520
you could deploy that a bit everywhere in the world, and then make your public radio

25:27.520 --> 25:28.520
astronomy like that.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
Interesting.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.520
Thanks.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
Any more questions?

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
Okay, we'll wrap it up.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Okay.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.520
Okay.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
Okay.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.520
Okay.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.520
Okay.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.520
Okay.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.520
Okay.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
Okay.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
Okay.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
Okay.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
All right.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.520
Okay.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.520
Okay.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
Okay.

25:46.520 --> 25:47.520
All right.
