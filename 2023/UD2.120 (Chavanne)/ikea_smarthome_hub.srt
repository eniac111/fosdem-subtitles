1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
All right.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:12.240
Oh, wow, microphone.

3
0:00:12.240 --> 0:00:16.960
A couple of months ago, I went shopping to the IKEA.

4
0:00:16.960 --> 0:00:22.680
So, who am I?

5
0:00:22.680 --> 0:00:24.600
My name is Hava.

6
0:00:24.600 --> 0:00:30.040
As the slide says, I've been playing with Linux and computers for over 20 years, and

7
0:00:30.040 --> 0:00:34.640
I've been doing it professionally for more than 10 years.

8
0:00:34.640 --> 0:00:41.200
I'm currently a software consultant at Mind, which is a local company.

9
0:00:41.200 --> 0:00:44.360
We have a rebranding, new logo here.

10
0:00:44.360 --> 0:00:48.040
Not on the slides yet.

11
0:00:48.040 --> 0:00:52.960
So, we're going to talk about this device.

12
0:00:52.960 --> 0:01:00.960
It's a new smart home hub from IKEA.

13
0:01:00.960 --> 0:01:04.640
Is smart home a good idea?

14
0:01:04.640 --> 0:01:08.680
I guess in this crowd, we have two extremes.

15
0:01:08.680 --> 0:01:16.440
You either think it's part of the Internet of shit, or you have already 20 of these devices

16
0:01:16.440 --> 0:01:18.960
at your home.

17
0:01:18.960 --> 0:01:30.920
Well, in my personal opinion, I like them a lot, but only if the data stays with me

18
0:01:30.920 --> 0:01:33.280
at my home, at my local computer.

19
0:01:33.280 --> 0:01:36.200
So, no clouds.

20
0:01:36.200 --> 0:01:41.480
And preferably, it should run as much open source software as possible.

21
0:01:41.480 --> 0:01:45.440
So, that's the state for this review.

22
0:01:45.440 --> 0:01:50.640
So, the app, well, if you...

23
0:01:50.640 --> 0:01:53.920
It's really, really simple.

24
0:01:53.920 --> 0:01:54.920
It's IKEA.

25
0:01:54.920 --> 0:02:02.360
It's what you can expect if you have ever assembled something from IKEA.

26
0:02:02.360 --> 0:02:04.960
You either love it or you hate it.

27
0:02:04.960 --> 0:02:07.440
So, this app, it's the same thing.

28
0:02:07.440 --> 0:02:12.120
You're either going to love it and can use it from scratch, or you're going to hate

29
0:02:12.120 --> 0:02:21.200
it like my mother, which also doesn't assemble IKEA furniture.

30
0:02:21.200 --> 0:02:26.160
Great app.

31
0:02:26.160 --> 0:02:31.760
Regarding the point I made from the cloud, they're actually scoring really great.

32
0:02:31.760 --> 0:02:38.200
So, there's a really clear and easy to read privacy statement.

33
0:02:38.200 --> 0:02:48.920
The app is opt-in, so it asks you nicely if you want to send the usage data towards IKEA

34
0:02:48.920 --> 0:02:52.160
in the same manner.

35
0:02:52.160 --> 0:02:55.520
It has support for Apple HomeKit.

36
0:02:55.520 --> 0:03:04.120
It also has support for the Google AI stuff, but it's all opt-in.

37
0:03:04.120 --> 0:03:06.760
Really nice.

38
0:03:06.760 --> 0:03:08.360
What's inside?

39
0:03:08.360 --> 0:03:15.800
Well, we're in an embedded room, so we have to take a look.

40
0:03:15.800 --> 0:03:26.960
This device has a dual-core STM processor, a single chip of DDR3 memory, and about four

41
0:03:26.960 --> 0:03:33.240
gigabytes of MMC memory, and dual Zigbee slash Bluetooth radios.

42
0:03:33.240 --> 0:03:37.640
So this should be fun to work with.

43
0:03:37.640 --> 0:03:42.600
Well, I opened it up.

44
0:03:42.600 --> 0:03:44.600
This thing has a laser.

45
0:03:44.600 --> 0:03:53.000
I always recognize these three pins on PCBs.

46
0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:56.440
Those pads look familiar.

47
0:03:56.440 --> 0:04:03.680
So simple UI thingy on the laptop.

48
0:04:03.680 --> 0:04:12.200
Use Minicom, default settings for Minicom, of course.

49
0:04:12.200 --> 0:04:18.200
We get the boot problems, but that's not really useful.

50
0:04:18.200 --> 0:04:24.640
It's the only thing that it shows.

51
0:04:24.640 --> 0:04:26.760
This is a Deregeiraherp.

52
0:04:26.760 --> 0:04:30.880
Very nice to tell me again.

53
0:04:30.880 --> 0:04:39.480
What we can see is that it uses the STM32 secure boot stuff.

54
0:04:39.480 --> 0:04:41.760
I don't really know the details quite yet.

55
0:04:41.760 --> 0:04:45.080
I haven't worked with those chips that much.

56
0:04:45.080 --> 0:04:50.200
And then it starts up system D, and it ends there.

57
0:04:50.200 --> 0:04:59.320
So what this is telling us is that they really cleaned up their information that they put

58
0:04:59.320 --> 0:05:03.280
on the UART.

59
0:05:03.280 --> 0:05:06.280
Right.

60
0:05:06.280 --> 0:05:17.840
In the app, they have a link to this website, gplcodes.ikea.com.

61
0:05:17.840 --> 0:05:24.280
And if you press that download button, you get a zip file.

62
0:05:24.280 --> 0:05:26.280
Yeah.

63
0:05:26.280 --> 0:05:31.240
And if you unzip that zip file, you get a bunch of directories.

64
0:05:31.240 --> 0:05:38.880
It's pretty much a huge dump of source code.

65
0:05:38.880 --> 0:05:47.800
The things that we do recognize in that entire dump, it's a kernel, system D, base files,

66
0:05:47.800 --> 0:05:57.840
everything is called base files, bless the box, and it uses ROG as the update mechanism.

67
0:05:57.840 --> 0:06:06.680
The naming of these directories makes me think that this uses Yocto, but there are no build

68
0:06:06.680 --> 0:06:16.840
scripts or flashing scripts included in this zip file.

69
0:06:16.840 --> 0:06:30.600
So if you go look at the Yocto reference manual in chapter 35-3, you see this text?

70
0:06:30.600 --> 0:06:36.320
35.3.1 talks about providing the source code.

71
0:06:36.320 --> 0:06:44.440
It shows you how to make a Yocto recipe to generate the directory that they just zipped

72
0:06:44.440 --> 0:06:49.200
and dumped on the internet.

73
0:06:49.200 --> 0:06:58.560
The next subchapter talks about providing the license text, which pretty much just takes

74
0:06:58.560 --> 0:07:07.320
all the license.txt from that first directory, concatenates them in one huge file.

75
0:07:07.320 --> 0:07:14.800
So that one is also, that's what this button does, download license information, so you

76
0:07:14.800 --> 0:07:18.320
get that huge file.

77
0:07:18.320 --> 0:07:28.680
And then they forgot about chapter 3, providing compilation scripts and the source code modifications.

78
0:07:28.680 --> 0:07:32.400
So IKEA, you have some more work to do.

79
0:07:32.400 --> 0:07:40.320
I would like my compilation scripts, and I would really like to flash my own hardware

80
0:07:40.320 --> 0:07:47.680
with the GPL code that I received on my hardware.

81
0:07:47.680 --> 0:07:49.240
And that's my talk.

82
0:07:49.240 --> 0:07:50.240
Thank you very much.

83
0:07:50.240 --> 0:08:04.260
