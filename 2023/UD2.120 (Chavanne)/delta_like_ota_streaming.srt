1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.680
Thanks for introducing me.

2
0:00:10.680 --> 0:00:16.400
Hello and welcome also from my side to the embedded dev room.

3
0:00:16.400 --> 0:00:21.180
We're going to hear something today about Delta-like streaming of encrypted over-the-air

4
0:00:21.180 --> 0:00:23.080
updates for ROG.

5
0:00:23.080 --> 0:00:29.160
So luckily I managed to put the entire abstract of the presentation already in the title.

6
0:00:29.160 --> 0:00:36.600
So what we hear about is the changes and developments during the roughly two or three years that

7
0:00:36.600 --> 0:00:41.040
happened in ROG, the ROG updating framework.

8
0:00:41.040 --> 0:00:46.720
And so it's basically the development that happened since we've last met here, I guess.

9
0:00:46.720 --> 0:00:48.200
So short notes about me.

10
0:00:48.200 --> 0:00:29.160
My name is Sandrik G

11
0:00:49.200 --> 0:00:50.920
I'm an embedded software developer.

12
0:00:50.920 --> 0:00:52.920
I work at Pangotronics.

13
0:00:52.920 --> 0:00:58.120
I'm the team lead of the integration team at Pangotronics and I'm the co-maintainer

14
0:00:58.120 --> 0:01:04.120
of the update framework ROG that we will hear more about soon.

15
0:01:04.120 --> 0:01:10.080
Pangotronics for those who don't know, it is a company based in Germany and we provide

16
0:01:10.080 --> 0:01:15.000
professional embedded Linux consulting and support and work closely together with the

17
0:01:15.000 --> 0:01:24.120
community and with since the beginning I think more than 7,000 patches in the Linux kernel.

18
0:01:24.120 --> 0:01:26.860
So a short overview of what we hear today.

19
0:01:26.860 --> 0:01:31.640
So the first thing is a short introduction into what ROG is for those who are not that

20
0:01:31.640 --> 0:01:34.200
familiar with but very, very short.

21
0:01:34.200 --> 0:01:39.920
Then we talk about the bundle format because this is crucial development for or the base

22
0:01:39.920 --> 0:01:43.600
for all the further features that are listed here.

23
0:01:43.600 --> 0:01:47.560
So the first thing I will talk about then is bundle streaming.

24
0:01:47.560 --> 0:01:55.600
Then we will hear about adaptive or Delta like updates, how to encrypt our bundle, give

25
0:01:55.600 --> 0:02:02.000
a short outlook on recent development about app updates and at the end we have a short

26
0:02:02.000 --> 0:02:08.720
look into what is coming next on features and what is in the ecosystem.

27
0:02:08.720 --> 0:02:14.120
So yeah, a typical over the air field update scenario could look like this.

28
0:02:14.120 --> 0:02:20.440
We have here our server, the server, the image that we want to deploy to the target.

29
0:02:20.440 --> 0:02:26.240
We create an update artifact from it, sign it, upload it to our deployment infrastructure

30
0:02:26.240 --> 0:02:33.200
and then we have the individual targets, update targets here that download the update and

31
0:02:33.200 --> 0:02:34.640
install it.

32
0:02:34.640 --> 0:02:40.680
And there's also still this conventional not so over the air use case for example using

33
0:02:40.680 --> 0:02:42.320
the USB stick.

34
0:02:42.320 --> 0:02:46.840
So what ROG handles is basically two parts.

35
0:02:46.840 --> 0:02:53.080
The first one is the creation of the update artifacts, the signing, verification and so

36
0:02:53.080 --> 0:03:01.220
on and the actual installation, the phase safe installation of the updates on the target.

37
0:03:01.220 --> 0:03:07.680
So yeah, basically ROG is an embedded Linux update framework so it handles the phase safe

38
0:03:07.680 --> 0:03:15.040
and atomic update of AB systems, so redundant system where you have one partition where

39
0:03:15.040 --> 0:03:19.560
you're running from an inactive partition and when you update you write your update

40
0:03:19.560 --> 0:03:21.840
into the inactive partition.

41
0:03:21.840 --> 0:03:26.800
Once you're done you switch in the boot loader to the inactive partition reboot and everything

42
0:03:26.800 --> 0:03:28.320
is fine.

43
0:03:28.320 --> 0:03:32.480
ROG is basically two parts on the target.

44
0:03:32.480 --> 0:03:39.960
It's the service that handles the update that runs and installs here and it gets its view

45
0:03:39.960 --> 0:03:44.960
on the system from the system configuration file.

46
0:03:44.960 --> 0:03:49.880
And yeah, the artifact for updating we call in ROG a bundle.

47
0:03:49.880 --> 0:03:53.440
A bundle consists of the images that should be installed.

48
0:03:53.440 --> 0:04:01.840
It consists of additional hooks or something like this and a manifest that holds the description

49
0:04:01.840 --> 0:04:04.440
what these images are for basically.

50
0:04:04.440 --> 0:04:11.040
So it's written in C with some utility libraries to not reinvent the wheel for everything.

51
0:04:11.040 --> 0:04:14.320
It's licensed on the LGPL and hosted on GitHub.

52
0:04:14.320 --> 0:04:21.800
And it was started in 2015 and I think the first release was in 2017.

53
0:04:21.800 --> 0:04:28.920
So yeah, as I already mentioned, the bundle format is quite essential for the next things

54
0:04:28.920 --> 0:04:30.400
that we talk about here.

55
0:04:30.400 --> 0:04:37.160
So let's first of all have a short look at the initial bundle formats because this was

56
0:04:37.160 --> 0:04:39.560
a motivation for changing the bundle format then.

57
0:04:39.560 --> 0:04:43.640
The initial bundle format was quite straightforward.

58
0:04:43.640 --> 0:04:48.880
It was just all the artifacts and the manifest packed together in a squash file system.

59
0:04:48.880 --> 0:04:55.040
We signed this squash file system and append the signature to the end of the bundle.

60
0:04:55.040 --> 0:04:58.280
So the verification is also quite easy.

61
0:04:58.280 --> 0:05:04.120
You just have to read the entire bundle and have to read the signature to be able to verify

62
0:05:04.120 --> 0:05:05.360
the bundle.

63
0:05:05.360 --> 0:05:09.560
So yeah, this is also the downside.

64
0:05:09.560 --> 0:05:17.880
Even if we don't also just want to access the manifest, we have to always authenticate

65
0:05:17.880 --> 0:05:19.720
or read the entire bundle.

66
0:05:19.720 --> 0:05:26.200
So this is quite slow and if it comes to over the air updating, it requires us to always

67
0:05:26.200 --> 0:05:30.840
download the full bundle before we can access any data in this.

68
0:05:30.840 --> 0:05:34.940
So yeah, this is bad if we want to use it for streaming.

69
0:05:34.940 --> 0:05:41.000
So this is why we have introduced in 2020 a new bundle format.

70
0:05:41.000 --> 0:05:47.680
And this bundle format is basically called the Verity format and it uses the DM Verity.

71
0:05:47.680 --> 0:05:57.080
So short intro, a device mapper system in Linux is a generic abstraction of manipulating

72
0:05:57.080 --> 0:05:58.080
block devices.

73
0:05:58.080 --> 0:06:03.140
So a device mapper has the same API as a block device has.

74
0:06:03.140 --> 0:06:06.880
So for the upper layer, it looks like it's just talking to a block device.

75
0:06:06.880 --> 0:06:12.860
But below it can manipulate the block device, authenticate data.

76
0:06:12.860 --> 0:06:21.200
It can merge data together like we know from DM Lendier and there are several device mappers

77
0:06:21.200 --> 0:06:22.260
in the kernel.

78
0:06:22.260 --> 0:06:26.680
So the one that we talk about here is DM Verity.

79
0:06:26.680 --> 0:06:33.260
It is basically an integrity protection method for read-only block devices.

80
0:06:33.260 --> 0:06:41.320
So the rough concept is that you split the block image into several chunks and generate

81
0:06:41.320 --> 0:06:47.420
a hash for each and of these you recursively do this again and again until you have a single

82
0:06:47.420 --> 0:06:58.280
root hash and then you can verify each single block until the root hash recursively.

83
0:06:58.280 --> 0:07:05.360
So yeah, you have a data protection or integrity protection for read-only files.

84
0:07:05.360 --> 0:07:08.800
The Verity table is just appended to the image.

85
0:07:08.800 --> 0:07:13.560
So let's see how we use this in the Rauch bundle.

86
0:07:13.560 --> 0:07:20.760
So we take our images here and first create the Verity hash and the root hash.

87
0:07:20.760 --> 0:07:25.880
The Verity hash is simply appended to the bundle and the root hash is now placed in

88
0:07:25.880 --> 0:07:28.160
the manifest.

89
0:07:28.160 --> 0:07:34.880
And then we just sign the manifest with an enveloping signature which means that the

90
0:07:34.880 --> 0:07:38.680
manifest is the payload of the signature.

91
0:07:38.680 --> 0:07:45.780
And what this gives us is now the verification of the manifest is quite easy.

92
0:07:45.780 --> 0:07:51.840
We just have to verify the manifest or the signature and get the manifest content.

93
0:07:51.840 --> 0:07:56.220
And inside the manifest there's also the root hash.

94
0:07:56.220 --> 0:08:05.680
This is then automatically trusted if we have verified the authentication of the manifest.

95
0:08:05.680 --> 0:08:14.480
And then we can set up the in Verity and use the hash tree appended to the manifest and

96
0:08:14.480 --> 0:08:22.360
the authenticated root hash and then for each access to each chunk or block on the block

97
0:08:22.360 --> 0:08:29.520
device this is authenticated to the Verity in the kernel and this allows you to have

98
0:08:29.520 --> 0:08:32.840
fully authenticated random access to your bundle.

99
0:08:32.840 --> 0:08:40.800
And you also you only need to verify by the time of using the data.

100
0:08:40.800 --> 0:08:47.720
So the next logical consequence is to implement streaming.

101
0:08:47.720 --> 0:08:51.600
So up to now Rauch was not so over the air.

102
0:08:51.600 --> 0:08:58.040
So downloading means that we assume there is an external service like Hawgbit or an

103
0:08:58.040 --> 0:09:05.680
application or an SCP that downloads the Rauch bundle to the target device and then with

104
0:09:05.680 --> 0:09:09.560
Rauch we start installing it from the local storage.

105
0:09:09.560 --> 0:09:12.400
Well the disadvantage of this is obvious.

106
0:09:12.400 --> 0:09:19.320
We have to have some extra space on the target where we can store the bundle and the artifacts

107
0:09:19.320 --> 0:09:24.480
can in a modern system become quite huge.

108
0:09:24.480 --> 0:09:34.800
And so the approach is that we implement streaming or downloading in Rauch itself.

109
0:09:34.800 --> 0:09:42.820
And if Rauch is able to do this and directly download it to the target device that we update

110
0:09:42.820 --> 0:09:46.280
then no intermediate storage would be required.

111
0:09:46.280 --> 0:09:51.320
So let's have a look how this is realized in Rauch.

112
0:09:51.320 --> 0:09:56.800
So first of all what we do in Rauch is that we spawn or fork an unprivileged helper process

113
0:09:56.800 --> 0:10:02.880
because Rauch runs as root as it has to update the system and you really don't want to use

114
0:10:02.880 --> 0:10:07.440
a root service to download data from the Internet.

115
0:10:07.440 --> 0:10:13.240
So it spawns an unprivileged helper and this helper acts as a translation.

116
0:10:13.240 --> 0:10:21.200
It plays a block device on one side and talks to the update server via HTTPS range request

117
0:10:21.200 --> 0:10:23.480
on the other side.

118
0:10:23.480 --> 0:10:32.440
And HTTP range request should be supported by all common web service also like TTP support

119
0:10:32.440 --> 0:10:37.960
this and it's also supported by many container delivery networks.

120
0:10:37.960 --> 0:10:44.200
And if we combine this now with what we've seen with the access to a variety bundle then

121
0:10:44.200 --> 0:10:50.920
we have fully authenticated random access to the remote bundle.

122
0:10:50.920 --> 0:10:57.100
And yeah we can randomly access so no intermediate storage is required.

123
0:10:57.100 --> 0:11:02.800
So the next need when we are able to download things is normally that we want to save download

124
0:11:02.800 --> 0:11:09.720
bandwidth because bandwidth is limited, expansive or something and the normal approach for this

125
0:11:09.720 --> 0:11:12.720
is to do conventional data updates.

126
0:11:12.720 --> 0:11:19.240
It means you have two versions of your image on your host system, calculate a delta and

127
0:11:19.240 --> 0:11:23.640
then you perform the update with this delta image on the target.

128
0:11:23.640 --> 0:11:28.760
So if you have the exact version that you have to calculate the delta for on your target

129
0:11:28.760 --> 0:11:37.320
this works very well, you can go here from version two to the target to version three.

130
0:11:37.320 --> 0:11:41.760
But if you now have a system that is on a different version, yeah this fails because

131
0:11:41.760 --> 0:11:43.900
it simply doesn't apply.

132
0:11:43.900 --> 0:11:52.560
So it's an optimal diff, it allows very small updates but yeah you're required to have access

133
0:11:52.560 --> 0:12:00.840
to the different image versions on the host and you only can update step by step.

134
0:12:00.840 --> 0:12:04.560
So from version one to version two to version three.

135
0:12:04.560 --> 0:12:12.320
So in Ralc we've chosen a different approach, a more generic approach for optimizing download,

136
0:12:12.320 --> 0:12:13.800
this is called adaptive updates.

137
0:12:13.800 --> 0:12:24.360
The concept behind this is that the bundle or the manifest itself provides a number of

138
0:12:24.360 --> 0:12:26.760
optimization options.

139
0:12:26.760 --> 0:12:32.960
So with each option there's normally an additional data connected that is stored in the device

140
0:12:32.960 --> 0:12:40.800
for optimizing the download but since we are able to stream the bundle we don't have to

141
0:12:40.800 --> 0:12:44.880
download these additional data that is stored in the manifest.

142
0:12:44.880 --> 0:12:50.600
And then it's a responsibility of the Ralc service on the target to see okay which of

143
0:12:50.600 --> 0:12:55.640
these capabilities do I support and which can I use and which is the best one.

144
0:12:55.640 --> 0:13:02.640
And there's always the fallback to use a full bundle download so you're always able to download

145
0:13:02.640 --> 0:13:06.560
the image you want to install.

146
0:13:06.560 --> 0:13:11.640
One method, adaptive method, generic one is the hash index.

147
0:13:11.640 --> 0:13:18.600
The idea behind this is that you split your image into several chunks and hash each chunk

148
0:13:18.600 --> 0:13:21.360
and generate a hash list from this.

149
0:13:21.360 --> 0:13:25.040
And for installation you just basically do the same on the target.

150
0:13:25.040 --> 0:13:31.080
You take your target device, block device for example, you hash it with the same algorithm

151
0:13:31.080 --> 0:13:32.560
and create the same hash index.

152
0:13:32.560 --> 0:13:39.400
And then for the optimization you just download first of all the hash index that is stored

153
0:13:39.400 --> 0:13:44.760
in the bundle and then you compare it line by line with the hashes that you've calculated

154
0:13:44.760 --> 0:13:46.080
on the target.

155
0:13:46.080 --> 0:13:51.480
And then you can download or just need to download the hashes that differ between what's

156
0:13:51.480 --> 0:13:53.520
on your target and what's in the bundle.

157
0:13:53.520 --> 0:14:00.280
And this works both for the intended target version but also if you come from a fully

158
0:14:00.280 --> 0:14:05.920
different image then you just have to download a bit more because the diff or the hashes

159
0:14:05.920 --> 0:14:08.880
that differ are a bit more.

160
0:14:08.880 --> 0:14:13.800
For both devices this is already implemented in the current drought version and there are

161
0:14:13.800 --> 0:14:21.120
also plans to support this for file based updates using Rsync and offline generated

162
0:14:21.120 --> 0:14:24.080
Jackson files.

163
0:14:24.080 --> 0:14:27.520
The next topic is bundle encryption.

164
0:14:27.520 --> 0:14:31.760
So the motivation is I think quite clear, you will have some sensitive data in your

165
0:14:31.760 --> 0:14:37.000
bundle and you want to protect it because you have it on an unsafe cloud storage or

166
0:14:37.000 --> 0:14:39.640
an unsafe communication channel.

167
0:14:39.640 --> 0:14:43.220
So in Rsync we have implemented this in two stage approach.

168
0:14:43.220 --> 0:14:47.280
So the first one is a symmetric encryption of only the payload.

169
0:14:47.280 --> 0:14:52.720
This is what normally already the build server does.

170
0:14:52.720 --> 0:14:56.400
And this does not yet require access to the key material.

171
0:14:56.400 --> 0:15:00.160
And the second part is the individual encryption.

172
0:15:00.160 --> 0:15:06.280
Then you can take the symmetrically encrypted image and encrypted per recipient.

173
0:15:06.280 --> 0:15:12.680
You can just take one key and encrypt it for all your devices by using a shared key or

174
0:15:12.680 --> 0:15:19.560
if you really want to do security then you can also use per device or per recipient keys

175
0:15:19.560 --> 0:15:27.720
and encrypt the bundle for many individual recipients, many thousands.

176
0:15:27.720 --> 0:15:33.520
So this again uses a device mapper, a different device mapper.

177
0:15:33.520 --> 0:15:35.600
Now we use DMCrypt.

178
0:15:35.600 --> 0:15:37.240
It's also quite simple.

179
0:15:37.240 --> 0:15:43.440
For the generation of the DMCrypt image or the image we use for DMCrypt we just split

180
0:15:43.440 --> 0:15:50.880
up the original image into equal sized chunks, generate random symmetric key and encrypt

181
0:15:50.880 --> 0:15:54.000
each block individual.

182
0:15:54.000 --> 0:16:03.760
And the DMCrypt device mapper then just provides a transparent description of the images.

183
0:16:03.760 --> 0:16:12.460
So if we access a chunk there then yeah, DMCrypt just decrypts this chunk we just selected

184
0:16:12.460 --> 0:16:18.720
with the key, with the symmetric key which is the same used for encrypting.

185
0:16:18.720 --> 0:16:24.040
And if we combine this now in the bundle, so we have here the image, encrypt it and

186
0:16:24.040 --> 0:16:31.720
combine it with DMVarity then we have a blockwise authenticated decryption.

187
0:16:31.720 --> 0:16:38.000
And since we have random access through the device mapper and the DMVarity format we also

188
0:16:38.000 --> 0:16:43.960
have the possibility to stream an encrypted update.

189
0:16:43.960 --> 0:16:48.800
So I'm short on time, a few notes about app updates.

190
0:16:48.800 --> 0:16:55.280
So far in Ralq we assumed the application is normally the application.

191
0:16:55.280 --> 0:17:03.080
We assumed a monotonic system where the application is the one thing that the device should do.

192
0:17:03.080 --> 0:17:08.360
And so we said okay, the application is normally either part of the root file system or you

193
0:17:08.360 --> 0:17:10.720
can have it in a separate slot.

194
0:17:10.720 --> 0:17:15.240
But it actually anyway linked against the libraries that are contained in the root file

195
0:17:15.240 --> 0:17:16.620
system.

196
0:17:16.620 --> 0:17:22.120
So it's fine to install, it's always together with the updated root file system.

197
0:17:22.120 --> 0:17:28.440
The reality is showed it's a bit different and there are more and more demands of having

198
0:17:28.440 --> 0:17:35.200
the capability of doing container updates, doing app store like updates and with you

199
0:17:35.200 --> 0:17:43.320
also have one vendor which provides a base system which is rarely updated and other vendors

200
0:17:43.320 --> 0:17:47.880
provide the applications which are much more frequently updated and additional data should

201
0:17:47.880 --> 0:17:49.280
be added there.

202
0:17:49.280 --> 0:17:54.400
And up to now we had no solution for this in Ralq and said okay, then use Ralq for the

203
0:17:54.400 --> 0:18:03.000
base system and use another update or update approach for this application or file updates.

204
0:18:03.000 --> 0:18:09.640
What we are working on and this is in a quite premature state actually is Ralq artifact

205
0:18:09.640 --> 0:18:10.640
update.

206
0:18:10.640 --> 0:18:17.520
The basic concept behind this is that you have a slot for artifacts and inside the slot

207
0:18:17.520 --> 0:18:22.380
we don't do image based updates but we do directory or file based updates.

208
0:18:22.380 --> 0:18:28.160
And then we provide the same as we do for image based updates.

209
0:18:28.160 --> 0:18:35.320
We ensure that the update is atomically and we also support both the case where we don't

210
0:18:35.320 --> 0:18:42.160
have any dependency of the app of the container to the base system, this is what you see here,

211
0:18:42.160 --> 0:18:49.160
but we also support the use case of having a dependency on the root file system but the

212
0:18:49.160 --> 0:18:55.160
need to more frequently and independently from the root file system update your application.

213
0:18:55.160 --> 0:19:02.920
So yeah, and together with our checks and files, the idea is that this again also supports

214
0:19:02.920 --> 0:19:07.800
streaming and Delta like updates.

215
0:19:07.800 --> 0:19:13.960
So just a very quick, I'll just show the other features and community things.

216
0:19:13.960 --> 0:19:18.720
We've switched to mason build system recently, this is already merged.

217
0:19:18.720 --> 0:19:20.640
It wasn't when I started the slides.

218
0:19:20.640 --> 0:19:27.520
So a new feature we also have is adding custom metadata in the manifest that you can then

219
0:19:27.520 --> 0:19:32.480
access via Ralq info or the deepest API for custom application.

220
0:19:32.480 --> 0:19:38.320
And an ongoing development is also about providing more fine grained process because currently

221
0:19:38.320 --> 0:19:43.480
we just have a slot, a pair slot progress and if you have a large tower then you wait

222
0:19:43.480 --> 0:19:48.920
very long until the progress gets to the next step.

223
0:19:48.920 --> 0:19:56.240
And a contribution that came or was started by the community as a real cockpit updater.

224
0:19:56.240 --> 0:20:01.880
This is basically an interface between the hotbit deployment server and Ralq on the other

225
0:20:01.880 --> 0:20:02.880
side.

226
0:20:02.880 --> 0:20:06.320
It talks via deepest API with Ralq.

227
0:20:06.320 --> 0:20:11.760
And this is a good example where the community started things and they moved them to the

228
0:20:11.760 --> 0:20:16.400
Ralq organization and are now maintained by the Ralq community.

229
0:20:16.400 --> 0:20:23.080
And with the latest version of the hotbit updater we are also compatible with using

230
0:20:23.080 --> 0:20:26.720
streaming updates for hotbit.

231
0:20:26.720 --> 0:20:32.680
And shout out to Leon who is sitting somewhere here in the room.

232
0:20:32.680 --> 0:20:40.320
The middle Ralq community is a layer or layer collection started by Leon which provides

233
0:20:40.320 --> 0:20:45.760
some example integration of Ralq into for example QEMO or Raspberry Pi.

234
0:20:45.760 --> 0:20:51.920
And it's a very good starting point if you want to check out how to use Ralq, how to

235
0:20:51.920 --> 0:20:54.480
use all the features in Ralq.

236
0:20:54.480 --> 0:21:00.360
And I really recommend you to use this as a starting point.

237
0:21:00.360 --> 0:21:04.840
And yeah.

238
0:21:04.840 --> 0:21:10.920
A final slide for an open source project it's always hard to know which are the uses of

239
0:21:10.920 --> 0:21:12.800
your project and where it's actually used.

240
0:21:12.800 --> 0:21:16.320
So it's always interesting for us to know this.

241
0:21:16.320 --> 0:21:21.640
One example where we came aware of that Ralq is used is a very famous one.

242
0:21:21.640 --> 0:21:26.240
It's a wild steam deck that uses Ralq together with the ASIN.

243
0:21:26.240 --> 0:21:30.080
Another example is the Home Assistant operating system that uses Ralq for updating the base

244
0:21:30.080 --> 0:21:33.640
system and the O'Naru Eclipse project.

245
0:21:33.640 --> 0:21:41.520
And one thing that I also find very interesting is that the information panels on the German

246
0:21:41.520 --> 0:21:48.080
ICE trains have a custom distribution they call Linux for ICE and they also use Ralq

247
0:21:48.080 --> 0:21:50.840
for updating their systems.

248
0:21:50.840 --> 0:21:54.320
So this was very quick.

249
0:21:54.320 --> 0:21:56.440
Thank you for attending.

250
0:21:56.440 --> 0:21:58.040
I think we still have two questions.

251
0:21:58.040 --> 0:21:59.040
Yeah.

252
0:21:59.040 --> 0:22:02.200
I think we have time for one or two questions.

253
0:22:02.200 --> 0:22:04.840
Hi there.

254
0:22:04.840 --> 0:22:05.840
Thank you for that.

255
0:22:05.840 --> 0:22:06.840
That's absolutely intriguing.

256
0:22:06.840 --> 0:22:08.380
Really interesting.

257
0:22:08.380 --> 0:22:11.120
So one of the questions was how do I plug this into BitBake.

258
0:22:11.120 --> 0:22:12.120
And Yvonne said that.

259
0:22:12.120 --> 0:22:13.120
That's great.

260
0:22:13.120 --> 0:22:14.120
I know what to do when I get home.

261
0:22:14.120 --> 0:22:16.760
In other words, what's the granularity of this?

262
0:22:16.760 --> 0:22:20.640
I saw a sort of a 4K block size in there somewhere.

263
0:22:20.640 --> 0:22:26.000
In terms of your hashes and then downloading blocks through the streaming process, is that

264
0:22:26.000 --> 0:22:27.080
4K increments?

265
0:22:27.080 --> 0:22:28.080
How does that change?

266
0:22:28.080 --> 0:22:32.360
And what's the overhead in verifying those hashes as you download?

267
0:22:32.360 --> 0:22:36.840
What's the impact on performance and have you looked at any figures for that?

268
0:22:36.840 --> 0:22:39.360
Getting quite low.

269
0:22:39.360 --> 0:22:46.640
So the question was if the 4K is fine grained enough for normal downloads.

270
0:22:46.640 --> 0:22:52.160
So it's currently fixed but it could also be changed if that's not sufficient.

271
0:22:52.160 --> 0:22:56.920
But in the current approach, the 4K is a fixed site there.

272
0:22:56.920 --> 0:22:58.240
Okay.

273
0:22:58.240 --> 0:22:59.240
So it's getting late.

274
0:22:59.240 --> 0:23:01.720
So unfortunately we don't have time for any more questions.

275
0:23:01.720 --> 0:23:06.680
But don't hesitate to ask them in matrix chat or try to catch our sticker in the corridor.

276
0:23:06.680 --> 0:23:11.000
You can ask questions and we can discuss.

277
0:23:11.000 --> 0:23:12.000
Thank you for a great talk.

278
0:23:12.000 --> 0:23:27.880
Thank you very much.
