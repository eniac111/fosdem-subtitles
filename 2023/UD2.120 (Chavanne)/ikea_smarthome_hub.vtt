WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
All right.

00:01.000 --> 00:12.240
Oh, wow, microphone.

00:12.240 --> 00:16.960
A couple of months ago, I went shopping to the IKEA.

00:16.960 --> 00:22.680
So, who am I?

00:22.680 --> 00:24.600
My name is Hava.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.040
As the slide says, I've been playing with Linux and computers for over 20 years, and

00:30.040 --> 00:34.640
I've been doing it professionally for more than 10 years.

00:34.640 --> 00:41.200
I'm currently a software consultant at Mind, which is a local company.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.360
We have a rebranding, new logo here.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.040
Not on the slides yet.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.960
So, we're going to talk about this device.

00:52.960 --> 01:00.960
It's a new smart home hub from IKEA.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.640
Is smart home a good idea?

01:04.640 --> 01:08.680
I guess in this crowd, we have two extremes.

01:08.680 --> 01:16.440
You either think it's part of the Internet of shit, or you have already 20 of these devices

01:16.440 --> 01:18.960
at your home.

01:18.960 --> 01:30.920
Well, in my personal opinion, I like them a lot, but only if the data stays with me

01:30.920 --> 01:33.280
at my home, at my local computer.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.200
So, no clouds.

01:36.200 --> 01:41.480
And preferably, it should run as much open source software as possible.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.440
So, that's the state for this review.

01:45.440 --> 01:50.640
So, the app, well, if you...

01:50.640 --> 01:53.920
It's really, really simple.

01:53.920 --> 01:54.920
It's IKEA.

01:54.920 --> 02:02.360
It's what you can expect if you have ever assembled something from IKEA.

02:02.360 --> 02:04.960
You either love it or you hate it.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.440
So, this app, it's the same thing.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.120
You're either going to love it and can use it from scratch, or you're going to hate

02:12.120 --> 02:21.200
it like my mother, which also doesn't assemble IKEA furniture.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.160
Great app.

02:26.160 --> 02:31.760
Regarding the point I made from the cloud, they're actually scoring really great.

02:31.760 --> 02:38.200
So, there's a really clear and easy to read privacy statement.

02:38.200 --> 02:48.920
The app is opt-in, so it asks you nicely if you want to send the usage data towards IKEA

02:48.920 --> 02:52.160
in the same manner.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.520
It has support for Apple HomeKit.

02:55.520 --> 03:04.120
It also has support for the Google AI stuff, but it's all opt-in.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.760
Really nice.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.360
What's inside?

03:08.360 --> 03:15.800
Well, we're in an embedded room, so we have to take a look.

03:15.800 --> 03:26.960
This device has a dual-core STM processor, a single chip of DDR3 memory, and about four

03:26.960 --> 03:33.240
gigabytes of MMC memory, and dual Zigbee slash Bluetooth radios.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.640
So this should be fun to work with.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.600
Well, I opened it up.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
This thing has a laser.

03:44.600 --> 03:53.000
I always recognize these three pins on PCBs.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.440
Those pads look familiar.

03:56.440 --> 04:03.680
So simple UI thingy on the laptop.

04:03.680 --> 04:12.200
Use Minicom, default settings for Minicom, of course.

04:12.200 --> 04:18.200
We get the boot problems, but that's not really useful.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.640
It's the only thing that it shows.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.760
This is a Deregeiraherp.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.880
Very nice to tell me again.

04:30.880 --> 04:39.480
What we can see is that it uses the STM32 secure boot stuff.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.760
I don't really know the details quite yet.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.080
I haven't worked with those chips that much.

04:45.080 --> 04:50.200
And then it starts up system D, and it ends there.

04:50.200 --> 04:59.320
So what this is telling us is that they really cleaned up their information that they put

04:59.320 --> 05:03.280
on the UART.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.280
Right.

05:06.280 --> 05:17.840
In the app, they have a link to this website, gplcodes.ikea.com.

05:17.840 --> 05:24.280
And if you press that download button, you get a zip file.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.280
Yeah.

05:26.280 --> 05:31.240
And if you unzip that zip file, you get a bunch of directories.

05:31.240 --> 05:38.880
It's pretty much a huge dump of source code.

05:38.880 --> 05:47.800
The things that we do recognize in that entire dump, it's a kernel, system D, base files,

05:47.800 --> 05:57.840
everything is called base files, bless the box, and it uses ROG as the update mechanism.

05:57.840 --> 06:06.680
The naming of these directories makes me think that this uses Yocto, but there are no build

06:06.680 --> 06:16.840
scripts or flashing scripts included in this zip file.

06:16.840 --> 06:30.600
So if you go look at the Yocto reference manual in chapter 35-3, you see this text?

06:30.600 --> 06:36.320
35.3.1 talks about providing the source code.

06:36.320 --> 06:44.440
It shows you how to make a Yocto recipe to generate the directory that they just zipped

06:44.440 --> 06:49.200
and dumped on the internet.

06:49.200 --> 06:58.560
The next subchapter talks about providing the license text, which pretty much just takes

06:58.560 --> 07:07.320
all the license.txt from that first directory, concatenates them in one huge file.

07:07.320 --> 07:14.800
So that one is also, that's what this button does, download license information, so you

07:14.800 --> 07:18.320
get that huge file.

07:18.320 --> 07:28.680
And then they forgot about chapter 3, providing compilation scripts and the source code modifications.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.400
So IKEA, you have some more work to do.

07:32.400 --> 07:40.320
I would like my compilation scripts, and I would really like to flash my own hardware

07:40.320 --> 07:47.680
with the GPL code that I received on my hardware.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.240
And that's my talk.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.240
Thank you very much.

07:50.240 --> 08:04.260
