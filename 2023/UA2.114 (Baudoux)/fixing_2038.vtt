WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
I'm Wookie and I have come to talk to you about the year 2038 problem.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.880
I would quite like to get feedback and not talk all the time, which means I have slightly

00:14.880 --> 00:17.160
too much information to give you in the time available.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.040
I will try and get this about right.

00:20.040 --> 00:24.920
So just to make sure people understand what the problem is, time t on Unix is a 32-bit

00:24.920 --> 00:33.400
signed int which started in 1970 and counts in seconds so it rolls over in January 2038,

00:33.400 --> 00:36.600
at which point bad things will probably happen.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.120
That is now less than 15 years away, which isn't very long when you consider the sorts

00:40.120 --> 00:43.200
of systems that will still be running 32-bit code in that time.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.200
There are a lot of other things which will also go wrong at various dates, but I'm not

00:47.200 --> 00:49.200
talking about those today.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.080
Now I don't claim to be a particular expert in this area, but I have been taking a look

00:54.080 --> 01:00.400
at it for the last few months because Debian needs to do something and we should work out

01:00.400 --> 01:02.240
what it is.

01:02.240 --> 01:07.560
So I just kind of try and relatively quickly cover the problem and the issues as far as

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
we know them.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.560
I was hoping to have done a few more tests before I got here so I could be a little bit

01:11.560 --> 01:14.760
more explicit about things that definitely will or will not break, but we are where we

01:14.760 --> 01:21.560
are and see what people think and also discover from you stuff that you know will break because

01:21.560 --> 01:23.760
I'd like to make a list.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.120
So obviously most people already use 64-bit computers which have 64-bit time to and this

01:28.120 --> 01:35.600
problem doesn't arise for many centuries, but there are still areas where cheap really

01:35.600 --> 01:41.400
matters and those people still use 32-bit, so cars, TVs, kind of embedded controllers

01:41.400 --> 01:46.800
for buildings and heat pumps and plants and all that stuff and also cheap phones.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.040
Talking to people in the business, 32-bit Android is still a thing and will remain a

01:50.040 --> 01:54.960
thing for quite a long time.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.760
The problem is that the stuff that people are still doing that with tends to get installed

01:58.760 --> 02:00.600
and left for a long time.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.440
So 15 years already isn't very long.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
We're a bit late.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.960
Quite a lot of the stuff that will break is already installed, well too late, but there

02:09.960 --> 02:13.560
will probably be more so we should probably fix it.

02:13.560 --> 02:19.280
Most of that stuff will be kind of embedded distros like OpenEmbedded and Android built

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
for the thing.

02:20.280 --> 02:26.480
So the set of stuff using kind of Debian style binary distros that the supplies to is fairly

02:26.480 --> 02:30.840
small but we should probably still fix it.

02:30.840 --> 02:38.400
Some 32-bit architectures don't care because they already started with 64-bit time desensibly.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.960
Big distros, I don't even care about 32-bit anymore.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.520
If anyone wants to contradict me on that, that will be useful.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.600
I'm pretty sure Red Hat's given up already.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.160
I don't know about Fedora and how long they tend to...

02:50.160 --> 02:53.200
Okay, excellent.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.000
Obviously most of the other 32-bit architectures are varying degrees of obsolete but sort of

02:59.000 --> 03:05.480
still in use now but probably definitely not by another 15 years time or at least stuff

03:05.480 --> 03:07.280
that will still be installed.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.120
But I think the one thing that does still exist and is still being used fairly heavily

03:10.120 --> 03:16.480
is ARMv7 and Debian intends to carry on maintaining that for as long as people are using it.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.640
So we kind of have to fix that.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.700
And this problem is harder if you're a binary distro than if you're a source, rebuild everything

03:21.700 --> 03:26.520
every time distro because how does the transition work?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.240
So what has been done so far?

03:28.240 --> 03:33.200
Ant, who unfortunately isn't here, he did quite a lot of work on this starting in 2017

03:33.200 --> 03:36.920
with deeper fixing a load of kernel stuff at the bottom of the stack.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.720
Turns out the Perl people fixed this 12 years ago, although in a slightly odd way of course

03:41.720 --> 03:44.720
because it's Perl.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.720
But the muzzle was fixed a couple of years ago, GLM2 was fixed last year, year before.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.800
And I think quite a lot of stuff...

03:52.800 --> 03:56.880
Because some of those embedded people especially have been building with new muzzle which forces

03:56.880 --> 04:00.480
64-bit time to quite a lot of stuff has been fixed.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.820
But I do not have a good handle on how much stuff still is not fixed and will just break

04:03.820 --> 04:04.820
if you build it with...

04:04.820 --> 04:10.360
It won't even build, never mind work or stuff which will build but it'll just explode your

04:10.360 --> 04:14.520
file formats or eat its old data or whatever.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.720
So again I would like feedback on that.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.680
So quite a lot of people have done quite a lot of work.

04:21.680 --> 04:26.040
Ant tried rebuilding Debian in 2020 but everything was too new and too much broke and he didn't

04:26.040 --> 04:27.240
get very far.

04:27.240 --> 04:33.720
So we've just done it again a couple of times last year and just rebuilding the base part,

04:33.720 --> 04:36.280
that's what I've done and that seems to work.

04:36.280 --> 04:41.680
And doing an ABI analysis, Steve Langisek did a load of work in Ubuntu on how many libraries

04:41.680 --> 04:45.240
actually change which we'll get to in a moment.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
So how does this work?

04:46.240 --> 04:51.520
So Glibc 3.34, the way they've done it is to support the old 32-bit ABI and the new

04:51.520 --> 04:55.720
64-bit ABI and each package, you know, you set a magic variable, are we doing 64-bit

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
or not?

04:56.720 --> 04:58.320
So it's a per build thing.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.800
Glibc doesn't just change.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.500
So normally an ABI transition, you know, you get the new library, it's different, you build

05:03.500 --> 05:05.920
against it, you get the new thing.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.000
So you don't have to do anything.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.280
But with Glibc we were given the choice, it's kind of unhelpful really.

05:12.280 --> 05:17.720
So something somewhere has to set the magic variable otherwise you'll get the old thing.

05:17.720 --> 05:23.040
They have some file format issues as well, the Yutomp and Co files and apparently that's

05:23.040 --> 05:24.040
fixed.

05:24.040 --> 05:29.240
QEMU allegedly is still broken but somebody has a plan.

05:29.240 --> 05:34.640
So just to make this a bit more complicated, Glibc sets file offset bits to 64 if you set

05:34.640 --> 05:35.780
time to 64.

05:35.780 --> 05:41.040
So you have to have large file systems if you're having 64-bit time.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.240
So that's two different ABI changes and that's been around a long time and people have been

05:45.240 --> 05:46.960
fixing it for ages.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.040
Again I don't know how much software doesn't work if you turn large file systems on, doesn't

05:52.040 --> 05:54.300
build, gets it wrong.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.920
My impression is that most stuff has been fixed and is actually using that already.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.400
But again I'm not sure of the numbers.

06:04.400 --> 06:10.760
The GNUlib, if you use GNUlib in your build system it will just turn on 64-bit support

06:10.760 --> 06:13.180
if Glibc provides it.

06:13.180 --> 06:17.160
So if you build with a modern Glibc you'll get 64-bit time to you unless you specifically

06:17.160 --> 06:20.320
set this magic variable you've never heard of to stop it doing that.

06:20.320 --> 06:24.080
So some people have been already bumped into 64-bit time when they weren't necessarily

06:24.080 --> 06:25.680
expecting it.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.840
And the last autocomp release was going, they decided that if you turned large file system

06:29.840 --> 06:33.280
on, you should have 64-bit time to you, either opposite way around the Glibc.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.920
Perfectively that meant anybody who'd ever put in large file system support any time

06:36.920 --> 06:42.200
in the last 15 years suddenly got 64-bit time to you if they re-autocomped, which some of

06:42.200 --> 06:45.440
us thought was a bit radical so we told them not to do that.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.600
But the thinking there was it's time, we should change.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.680
Please will people get a move on.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.960
So it wasn't completely crazy but I think that would surprise too many people I think.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.500
But we do need to work out how are we going to do this without surprise, so people transition

07:01.500 --> 07:07.400
but like when they expected to not because something they hadn't noticed changed.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.400
So the point here is if you use time t in any struct, especially in a public ABI for

07:12.400 --> 07:19.200
your library particularly or any file, then if the size changes, the ABI changes and your

07:19.200 --> 07:21.720
file format changes.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.000
And that is the transition we have to deal with.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.080
Now new ABIs is not uncommon, it happens all the time, libraries change, add new stuff,

07:30.080 --> 07:35.160
we're not adding new stuff, that's okay, but change stuff.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.960
But this is a big one because it affects a lot of packages, but not as big as some we've

07:38.960 --> 07:41.400
done in the past.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.760
File formats I think is harder to quantify and work out quite how big a problem that

07:45.760 --> 07:51.720
is or still is and it's kind of up to each, mostly an application level thing, you know,

07:51.720 --> 07:55.440
if your app stores files and it needs to be able to read its old files and its new files

07:55.440 --> 07:58.200
without exploding.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.240
File formats is a bit trickier, but again mostly that's been dealt with in the kernel,

08:03.240 --> 08:05.040
I believe.

08:05.040 --> 08:09.840
So the fundamental question, especially for Debian, but kind of more generally for everybody,

08:09.840 --> 08:15.480
is are we just going to update the existing architecture with this new feature which changes

08:15.480 --> 08:19.160
the ABI, which is what everybody's done so far.

08:19.160 --> 08:25.120
You just rebuild it with the new 64 bit time and stuff changes, but we still call it ARM

08:25.120 --> 08:31.960
Linux, new ABIHF or whatever in x86 world equivalent.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.400
That's not too bad if you rebuild from scratch every time, it's quite a lot harder in the

08:35.400 --> 08:41.320
binary distro world where we expect to upgrade things as we go along.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.320
And it does change the ABI, so in a sense this is kind of wrong because that triplet

08:45.320 --> 08:48.920
defines an ABI, but on the other hand we do this all the time.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.240
LFS changes the ABI and nobody said we need a new triplet for that.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.160
But from Debian's point of view, arguably a lot of people have said well this is too

08:57.160 --> 09:01.400
big and scary and everything might break, so let's not do that, let's just start a new

09:01.400 --> 09:09.040
architecture with a new triplet and then we'll know it's all done, everything will correspond

09:09.040 --> 09:13.720
and we're much less likely to get random breakage from a bit of half and half time to 32 bit

09:13.720 --> 09:17.080
and 64 bit time.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.800
But on the other hand, other stuff will break just because you've changed the name of the

09:21.800 --> 09:25.920
triplet and stuff, there's always some breakage in there.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.360
The problem is that if we decide we need a new architecture and everybody else has done

09:29.360 --> 09:33.600
it with the old triplet name, now the old triplet name means two different things, it

09:33.600 --> 09:38.480
means the new ABI or the old ABI for in Debian ecosystem and that doesn't seem like a good

09:38.480 --> 09:40.440
place to be either.

09:40.440 --> 09:47.040
So I don't know, if we could all agree what we're doing amongst distro people who care,

09:47.040 --> 09:51.320
that would be really helpful.

09:51.320 --> 09:59.600
But as I said, glibc doesn't enforce 64 bit time t, so if just building against a new

09:59.600 --> 10:04.360
glibc doesn't put you in 64 bit world, something somewhere has to set the magic variable and

10:04.360 --> 10:09.600
the question is, does dpacket do that or glibc do that or gcc do that, I mean it seems to

10:09.600 --> 10:14.800
me glibc should probably do it, but at the moment that's not a thing, we can work that

10:14.800 --> 10:15.800
out.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.280
As I said, a new triplet is kind of easier, we just start again, it gives the opportunity

10:19.280 --> 10:23.440
to call it arm 32 for the rest of the time, which would be a much better name, but you

10:23.440 --> 10:28.400
know, a very small bonus in comparison to how much work is involved.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.560
So in a way this transition is just like any other large transition and we've done it before,

10:32.560 --> 10:37.760
glibc5 to glibc6 was massive and that was like everything had to transition in one go,

10:37.760 --> 10:41.880
Debian was smaller back then which made it a bit easier and it affected everybody, so

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
everybody had an incentive.

10:42.880 --> 10:48.220
The problem here is that it only really is an armhf problem, but if we have a big transition

10:48.220 --> 10:54.400
with lots of libraries, everybody has to wait whilst that piles up and then goes through

10:54.400 --> 10:59.280
and all the other architectures, proper architectures will complain and go, well you people get

10:59.280 --> 11:02.680
a move on, you've bunged up the whole world.

11:02.680 --> 11:07.720
But we have done this before, back in 2007, apparently long doubles changed from 64 bits

11:07.720 --> 11:13.240
to 128 bits on a whole load of relatively minor architectures nobody cares about, not

11:13.240 --> 11:18.800
now, I mean they probably cared a bit more 13 years ago and the world didn't expect,

11:18.800 --> 11:24.120
I didn't even notice, so it can't have been that bad.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.920
So yeah, so I had a look at some numbers, how big is this problem, is it completely

11:27.920 --> 11:29.840
intractable or not?

11:29.840 --> 11:31.520
I think that's quite an important question.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.880
So six and a half thousand packages out of our 35,000 have time to end them at all, so

11:36.880 --> 11:42.160
that's how big it could possibly be, but an awful lot of that is not in public APIs or

11:42.160 --> 11:47.880
file formats, again I have really no handle on how big the file format part of this is,

11:47.880 --> 11:52.720
but the API part we're getting a reasonable idea, so in the bottom 150 packages that you

11:52.720 --> 11:57.520
make to just bootstrap a system, 85 of those are libraries and 7 of those actually change

11:57.520 --> 12:00.680
with time t, so that doesn't sound too bad.

12:00.680 --> 12:06.720
Steve Langisek's done a very useful bit of work on Ubuntu, up to all 767 library packages,

12:06.720 --> 12:13.440
209 didn't analyse for tedious reasons, weak mobile layer, but of the 558 that did, 17%

12:13.440 --> 12:17.840
of them, i.e. 82, did change the ABI.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.560
So that doesn't sound too crazy.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.840
If we assume the same sort of fraction in the bit that's not yet analysed, there's

12:24.840 --> 12:30.200
maybe 115 libraries or something like that which would need to transition together.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.840
So that's a lot, but it's probably doable.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.720
I've just done some fairly random experiments having built both standard armhf, armhf with

12:39.720 --> 12:43.720
large file systems and armhf with time t and large file systems and just tried putting

12:43.720 --> 12:48.640
binaries in between them, and nothing obviously blew up, it didn't just immediately fail,

12:48.640 --> 12:54.840
so it's not that bad, but I didn't have a good set of things you should actually check,

12:54.840 --> 13:00.040
what are the tests I should run having installed some of this on the old system to see whether

13:00.040 --> 13:01.440
it broke.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.400
So I think we need a list like that to kind of get a handle on how bad that part of the

13:06.400 --> 13:07.400
problem is.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.520
So here's a few things which have been mentioned as potential problems, NFS version 3, apparently

13:12.520 --> 13:16.920
the time there, sometimes it's signed or sometimes it isn't depending on the client implementation,

13:16.920 --> 13:21.280
so some of them won't break for another 150 years, some will.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.200
That'll annoy some people.

13:24.200 --> 13:31.040
I don't know how many NFS people haven't moved to V4 yet, probably some.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.680
X3 is a problem, I don't know anything about that.

13:32.680 --> 13:38.280
XFS was a problem, but I believe that's fixed in kernel 5.10 or something.

13:38.280 --> 13:42.080
CPU was alleged to be a problem, but then somebody else told me that it has 11 octal

13:42.080 --> 13:46.280
digits and therefore 33 bits, so we've got another 150 years before that breaks.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.600
Does anybody know for a fact?

13:48.600 --> 13:53.600
There's a lot of room that shouldn't know stuff like this.

13:53.600 --> 13:59.520
Apparently INN will break, but you know, that's a thing, it could be fixed.

13:59.520 --> 14:06.880
32 bit wine on 32 bit systems with 64 bit time to allegedly might break, but then that's

14:06.880 --> 14:14.280
only on i386, I don't think we care about that, so I'm probably going to ignore that.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
So yeah, what else?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.880
Again, we shall come to some questions in a moment.

14:17.880 --> 14:23.040
I'm sure there's quite a lot of other things, but I don't know what they are.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.320
So yeah, it's question time.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.280
I have done that reasonably quickly, excellent.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.520
I would like feedback from people.

14:32.520 --> 14:36.840
So this point about the, are we doing a new architecture or not?

14:36.840 --> 14:40.320
Thinking so far in Debian has been kind of, this feels very big and intractable and we're

14:40.320 --> 14:41.800
not sure how bad it is.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.640
So it's a lot safer to do a new thing.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.920
But having done some research, the research I've seen suggests that maybe it's not so

14:48.920 --> 14:50.120
enormous we can't do this.

14:50.120 --> 14:55.480
So I think an in place transition probably is doable.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.400
There will probably be some breakage, but it'll only be an armchair, so it's like, we could

14:59.400 --> 15:03.400
just annoy those people for a while.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
It might eat your files a lot.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.880
I think that's the thing that is really going to piss people off.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.680
If you install a new thing and halfway through, it just corrupts files.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.440
They could be important.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.320
That's not good.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.040
So that's the driver for going, let's just do a new triplet.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.720
But I don't think anybody else wants to do a new triplet because most people have sort

15:21.720 --> 15:26.680
of fixed this with a standard transition within the system and a rebuild.

15:26.680 --> 15:32.560
So I'm not going to say what I think just yet, but I have been developing an opinion

15:32.560 --> 15:34.240
having done this research.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.160
Yeah, I would like to say I would love to get a list of things like, you know, is Dbus

15:38.160 --> 15:39.160
going to break?

15:39.160 --> 15:43.920
Does it have any times in it that's half your things are using new time and the other half

15:43.920 --> 15:50.080
are using old time and Dbus has, well, things like that, you know, IPC mechanisms as opposed

15:50.080 --> 15:51.960
to ABIs.

15:51.960 --> 15:55.160
I think the ABI problem we understand is the rest of it.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.160
I'm a bit worried about.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.160
Yeah.

15:58.160 --> 16:03.440
I'm not quite sure how to get, does anybody want to say anything?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.440
Somebody wants to say something.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.720
Have we got a roaming mic?

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
Excellent.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.720
Steve, yeah, I see.

16:11.720 --> 16:22.880
Hi, Wookiee.

16:22.880 --> 16:26.760
Hi.

16:26.760 --> 16:33.600
So of course, having discussed about this a bit in the past, this is most complicated

16:33.600 --> 16:36.800
on arm hf, as you said.

16:36.800 --> 16:46.040
It's probably not possible to necessarily change the ABI of i386 because there are a whole

16:46.040 --> 16:50.760
load of old binaries that people will not be able to run anymore.

16:50.760 --> 16:56.580
And the only reason you'd ever care about running i386 is for shitty old binaries.

16:56.580 --> 17:01.360
It's less of an issue, therefore, arm hf, so that might be feasible.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.320
Yeah.

17:03.320 --> 17:11.000
So we need good test suites for all of these things and for good integration tests, as

17:11.000 --> 17:15.040
you say, for either end of IPC and that kind of thing.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.800
I have no idea on those.

17:17.800 --> 17:27.080
I wish I did.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.080
Okay.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.560
I have the same concern about 32-bit wine, which is people care about that for running

17:33.560 --> 17:35.400
shitty old Windows binaries.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
Somehow, somehow...

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
I care about that.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.760
I have some shitty old Windows binaries and that's what it's for.

17:40.760 --> 17:46.560
I mean, somehow Win32 has become this lingua franca of I need an old program to run on

17:46.560 --> 17:52.600
any machine and now, like, if we look at what Valve is doing with Proton, they've just decided,

17:52.600 --> 17:54.680
fine, Win32 is the standard for it.

17:54.680 --> 17:59.040
So I realize there's a difference between Win32 and the architecture that it runs on,

17:59.040 --> 18:08.200
but Win32 specifically, as I understand it, 64-bit wine doesn't run 32-bit Windows binaries.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
Correct.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.440
So the thing is, wine already does API translation.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.480
That's what it does, right?

18:14.480 --> 18:19.320
So it seems to me that if the underlying system has 64-bit time calls, I'm not sure it necessarily

18:19.320 --> 18:21.560
can't work with the old binaries.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
Oh, that's something I haven't thought about.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.640
I understand exactly how this works.

18:24.640 --> 18:30.520
So I don't know whether, in fact, that is fixable or, as I say, whether anybody cares

18:30.520 --> 18:34.800
enough about i386 world, just leave it alone.

18:34.800 --> 18:40.120
I hadn't thought about the fact that that relies on the Windows time format, which isn't

18:40.120 --> 18:41.680
faced with this problem.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.680
Yeah.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.600
So, yeah, I'm not sure whether it's actually a big deal, just means someone would have

18:46.600 --> 18:50.000
to do some work in some old code that everyone's left alone for a very long time and nobody

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
can remember how it works.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.760
I also wonder about ARMv5.

18:53.760 --> 18:58.120
There's an awful lot of Raspberry Pi ones floating around the world right now.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.120
Yes.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.760
It's a good point, actually.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.560
Are there any Pi people in the room?

19:06.560 --> 19:08.680
What have the Pi people thought about this problem?

19:08.680 --> 19:17.840
I haven't talked to the Pi people yet, and he's quite right that it's a significant constituency.

19:17.840 --> 19:31.720
I'm not from Rhine, but I remember something about improving their abstraction so that

19:31.720 --> 19:36.720
you can run 32-bit WINE applications on a 64-bit WINE.

19:36.720 --> 19:50.240
So to move the 64-bit, 32-bit translation into WINE so that the native libraries are

19:50.240 --> 19:57.160
all 64-bit, and I'm not sure if that would actually solve the year 2038 problem.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.160
Fair enough.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
So we're not sure.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.160
Totally good.

20:00.160 --> 20:06.440
So does anybody have things which they know will break, which have not been mentioned?

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
People.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.800
There's a lot of software out there.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.440
Because if we don't know of lots of things that will break, maybe this isn't as bad as

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
the...

20:15.440 --> 20:16.440
Yes.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.440
Yes.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.440
Yes.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.440
Yes.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.440
Yes.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.440
Yes.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.440
Yes.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.440
Yes.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
Yes.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
Yes.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.440
Yes.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.440
Yes.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.440
Yes.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.440
Yes.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.440
Yes.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.440
Yes.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.440
Yes.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.440
Yes.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.440
Yes.

20:34.440 --> 20:40.160
So you can use this magic autoconf variable that switches the transition to 64-bit time

20:40.160 --> 20:47.680
to off, but you cannot be sure that somebody used, well, maybe an unreleased part of Knulip

20:47.680 --> 20:54.000
into his autoconf code or whatever, and there are lots of exotic build systems out there

20:54.000 --> 20:59.760
where somebody may just say we are using 64-bit time, and then you have some random piece

20:59.760 --> 21:04.000
of software that is compiled in one way and some other random piece of software that is

21:04.000 --> 21:05.360
compiled the other way.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.640
So it's kind of already...

21:08.640 --> 21:13.400
We are already in a mess, and we just need to find the best way to get out of it.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.840
And the other thing that I wanted to say is that...

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
I mean, I'm...

21:17.840 --> 21:18.840
Personally, I'm...

21:18.840 --> 21:33.840
...who want to keep doing this.

21:33.840 --> 21:38.720
I want to keep some ancient software running with binary compatibility, so...

21:38.720 --> 21:44.240
Yeah, I think, as I said, the big boys just abandoned 32-bit world, so they decided it's

21:44.240 --> 21:45.240
not their problem.

21:45.240 --> 21:51.760
Yeah, I'm also not from wine, but for sure, regarding what I was saying before, yeah,

21:51.760 --> 21:57.840
1.8 is basically going to start to support running on 64-bit, so the 32 binaries, so

21:57.840 --> 21:58.840
that won't be a problem.

21:58.840 --> 22:04.480
Another thing you mentioned, stuff like debus, as well, won't be a problem, because debus

22:04.480 --> 22:06.080
is not a type for time.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.720
It's basically passing numbers.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.200
You define the kind of...

22:09.200 --> 22:11.640
It's not passing time structs around to people.

22:11.640 --> 22:18.080
Yeah, I mean, it's my passing time, but it's not the time type, so basically you define

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
the kind of...

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Yeah, it was a problem.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.040
I don't know how it works, but yeah.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.560
Any sort of protocol like that which was being given structs by one application and taking

22:26.560 --> 22:30.520
them out by another, if they have a different understanding of how big the time variable

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
is, it won't work.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.800
Yeah, you know, that's exactly true, but I mean, in that case, there shouldn't be a

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
problem.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.440
Why it might be a problem for stuff like using socket or FDS, that's indeed an issue, and

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
that's...

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
Right.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.440
I mean, just to respond to Andrea, the...

22:45.440 --> 22:50.000
I was going to say, no, my brain's failed.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.320
No, that's right.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.520
The fact that people, as you say, already there's a certain amount of randomness in

22:54.520 --> 22:58.760
what's built out there, if we're not noticing a huge number of problems from it, then maybe

22:58.760 --> 22:59.760
it's not too bad, right?

22:59.760 --> 23:03.960
You know, it could be viewed as a good thing, as a good sign.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.880
I don't know.

23:05.880 --> 23:10.880
In any case, when you said that you have to do large scale rebuild and that source distro

23:10.880 --> 23:15.680
is having easy, that's not entirely true because we will also have to schedule for our users

23:15.680 --> 23:17.080
a large scale rebuild.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
True.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
Easier, I think.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.080
Yeah.

23:20.080 --> 23:26.800
There was someone up there.

23:26.800 --> 23:32.840
There's at least an NTP which has some time of time T and...

23:32.840 --> 23:33.840
Yeah, that's 26.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.840
That runs out.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
So actually that's first.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.480
And that may be an even bigger disaster.

23:38.480 --> 23:54.040
Yeah, I further understand that I have time T2.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.280
I need to find that link for you.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.280
Okay, yes, please.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
Send me...

23:59.280 --> 24:03.640
If anybody wants to send me examples of things that should be tested, that will be brilliant.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.120
I think is probably the way to do it.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.040
But the other thing that I failed to get onto is there's a list where we intend to discuss

24:09.040 --> 24:11.560
this and produce a plan quite soon.

24:11.560 --> 24:16.080
I think we should do something like this year, whatever the hell it is.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.840
And we need a reasonable...

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Some representatives from each...

24:19.840 --> 24:22.560
It doesn't need to be very many people, but you know, the fairly small number of people

24:22.560 --> 24:41.200
who actually care about this problem...

24:41.200 --> 24:43.000
Which you're particularly worried about.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.760
Yeah, I guess that's our time anyway.

24:47.760 --> 24:48.760
So thank you very much.

24:48.760 --> 24:56.160
Thank you very much.
