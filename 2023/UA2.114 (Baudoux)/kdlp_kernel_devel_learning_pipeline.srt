1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
Okay.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:02.000
All right.

3
0:00:02.000 --> 0:00:03.000
Is Mike working?

4
0:00:03.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Yeah.

5
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:05.000
All right.

6
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:06.000
Great.

7
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Okay.

8
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:08.000
All right.

9
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:09.000
Welcome, everyone.

10
0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:22.800
I'm going to talk about a program that I've started at Red Hat called Kernel Development

11
0:00:22.800 --> 0:00:29.360
Learning Pipeline that I run with a small group of engineers have as a side project.

12
0:00:29.360 --> 0:00:33.600
So first I'll talk about, you know, what it is, first of all, you know, why it's a good

13
0:00:33.600 --> 0:00:37.000
idea, why we think it's a good idea and we're doing it.

14
0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:41.240
A little bit about the program and some of the growth that we've had in the program over

15
0:00:41.240 --> 0:00:46.280
the past year, two years approximately.

16
0:00:46.280 --> 0:00:50.960
And then conclude with some resources about the program.

17
0:00:50.960 --> 0:00:53.240
So first of all, what is KDLP?

18
0:00:53.240 --> 0:00:57.720
So that stands for Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a credit for that acronym to Julia

19
0:00:57.720 --> 0:01:00.280
Dedem actually.

20
0:01:00.280 --> 0:01:05.640
And we are building a comprehensive pipeline for Linux kernel talent and low level talent

21
0:01:05.640 --> 0:01:07.560
more generally.

22
0:01:07.560 --> 0:01:11.400
Because as it turns out, it's, you know, there's not a lot of younger people getting into the

23
0:01:11.400 --> 0:01:12.400
kernel.

24
0:01:12.400 --> 0:01:15.080
It's not an extremely popular area of study.

25
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:18.520
It's barely really taught in school.

26
0:01:18.520 --> 0:01:24.640
So right now the main component is, you know, we have a course that we're teaching at UMass

27
0:01:24.640 --> 0:01:28.400
Lowell and also on the Linux Foundation's platform.

28
0:01:28.400 --> 0:01:33.640
We are trying to recruit interns from this course and from this program and through our

29
0:01:33.640 --> 0:01:35.320
kind of our network.

30
0:01:35.320 --> 0:01:39.000
We bring people in and then they serve as TAs and help develop the course and improve

31
0:01:39.000 --> 0:01:40.840
the content.

32
0:01:40.840 --> 0:01:43.960
And then ideally, you know, we bring them in and recruit them full time.

33
0:01:43.960 --> 0:01:46.200
That's the goal.

34
0:01:46.200 --> 0:01:48.600
So yeah, why is this a good idea?

35
0:01:48.600 --> 0:01:54.560
So like I was saying, a lot of senior Linux kernel engineers are getting somewhat close

36
0:01:54.560 --> 0:01:55.560
to retirement.

37
0:01:55.560 --> 0:02:00.200
That's kind of definitely a much higher, I think, average age in kernel and in low level

38
0:02:00.200 --> 0:02:06.320
engineering at least in the U.S. that I've noticed than in other areas of software engineering.

39
0:02:06.320 --> 0:02:12.120
And it takes a very long time for people to learn the Linux kernel, especially today because

40
0:02:12.120 --> 0:02:16.640
a lot of people don't even learn C in school and they're generally, you know, separated

41
0:02:16.640 --> 0:02:20.280
from a lot of the low level kind of computer science concepts.

42
0:02:20.280 --> 0:02:24.640
Things that people, you know, 20, 30, 40 years ago, so I'm told, were learned kind of as

43
0:02:24.640 --> 0:02:26.560
a standard thing.

44
0:02:26.560 --> 0:02:29.560
Today it's sort of a niche topic.

45
0:02:29.560 --> 0:02:34.640
I mean, there are people getting into it, but you know, only kind of in niche communities

46
0:02:34.640 --> 0:02:40.760
at certain schools, you know, if you're exposed to certain people or certain online communities.

47
0:02:40.760 --> 0:02:43.160
So I mean, the kernel itself is barely taught.

48
0:02:43.160 --> 0:02:46.440
I mean, people take maybe one class in operating systems and a lot of the tools, like some

49
0:02:46.440 --> 0:02:50.920
of the more advanced get usage, for example, that's, it's difficult to learn that kind

50
0:02:50.920 --> 0:02:51.920
of stuff.

51
0:02:51.920 --> 0:02:54.760
Like how do people learn how to do email patches without trying and failing and just getting

52
0:02:54.760 --> 0:02:55.760
roasted online?

53
0:02:55.760 --> 0:02:58.160
It's kind of difficult.

54
0:02:58.160 --> 0:03:01.920
So for a lot of companies, it's difficult to find talent.

55
0:03:01.920 --> 0:03:06.120
I mean, I know, you know, at Red Hat, it can be somewhat difficult to find people who are,

56
0:03:06.120 --> 0:03:10.240
you know, have some Linux kernel knowledge and, you know, are actually interested in

57
0:03:10.240 --> 0:03:11.240
doing it.

58
0:03:11.240 --> 0:03:14.880
You know, there's lots of people who are capable of doing it and just maybe don't like it that

59
0:03:14.880 --> 0:03:15.880
much.

60
0:03:15.880 --> 0:03:19.560
But of course, you know, the way that we're pitching this to Red Hat and, you know, the

61
0:03:19.560 --> 0:03:23.480
way that it's a good idea for any company is that we think we can bring more value to

62
0:03:23.480 --> 0:03:25.440
the company for a lower cost.

63
0:03:25.440 --> 0:03:29.640
But for the community, what we are trying to bring is to train the next generation of

64
0:03:29.640 --> 0:03:34.200
developers from all sorts of different backgrounds, as opposed to just people who, you know, like

65
0:03:34.200 --> 0:03:38.320
happen to bump into somebody at a recruiting event, which is how I got into the kernel.

66
0:03:38.320 --> 0:03:44.360
I just happened to run into somebody at an event that he wasn't even supposed to be at,

67
0:03:44.360 --> 0:03:45.560
in fact.

68
0:03:45.560 --> 0:03:48.040
So a little overview.

69
0:03:48.040 --> 0:03:51.440
So there's kind of three main sections of the program.

70
0:03:51.440 --> 0:03:57.880
So the first is this kernel development course that we've developed that is taught at UMass

71
0:03:57.880 --> 0:03:58.880
Lowell.

72
0:03:58.880 --> 0:04:02.800
So we've created this from scratch using, originally based on the Linux Device Driver's

73
0:04:02.800 --> 0:04:05.560
3rd Edition book, but we've, you know, kind of gone further from that.

74
0:04:05.560 --> 0:04:09.720
That's actually one of the latest books on Linux kernel engineering and it's published

75
0:04:09.720 --> 0:04:12.920
in 2005.

76
0:04:12.920 --> 0:04:18.040
But yeah, so we've been working on developing our own curriculum with a number of different

77
0:04:18.040 --> 0:04:26.800
labs and some slide decks and kind of a whole set of things that people could do to learn

78
0:04:26.800 --> 0:04:28.600
the kernel.

79
0:04:28.600 --> 0:04:32.720
And then from there, we try to bring people into internships as we're able to do that,

80
0:04:32.720 --> 0:04:38.120
or other kind of more second level or hands-on experiences where they can further develop

81
0:04:38.120 --> 0:04:39.960
those skills.

82
0:04:39.960 --> 0:04:43.240
And then ideally bring them in as full-time engineers at Red Hat, or I mean the beauty

83
0:04:43.240 --> 0:04:46.480
of open source is if they get recruited somewhere else or if they go work somewhere else in

84
0:04:46.480 --> 0:04:49.600
the open source community, that's still, that's a win for everyone in the community.

85
0:04:49.600 --> 0:04:52.880
It's a win for all the companies working with the community, right, because everyone working

86
0:04:52.880 --> 0:04:57.160
on the kernel is working on the kernel.

87
0:04:57.160 --> 0:04:59.200
So a little more about the course.

88
0:04:59.200 --> 0:05:02.520
The goal is to introduce students to Linux kernel development.

89
0:05:02.520 --> 0:05:05.280
You know, obviously we can't teach them the entire kernel.

90
0:05:05.280 --> 0:05:07.560
We can barely even introduce them to one subsystem.

91
0:05:07.560 --> 0:05:12.480
But the goal is to teach them kind of what they need to learn, to teach themselves, and

92
0:05:12.480 --> 0:05:16.640
to teach them what they need to know to work in one of these open source communities, specifically

93
0:05:16.640 --> 0:05:21.360
the Linux kernel community, but those skills I think are pretty applicable to other kind

94
0:05:21.360 --> 0:05:26.160
of more niche open source areas that can be somewhat intimidating for a lot of people

95
0:05:26.160 --> 0:05:28.400
to get into.

96
0:05:28.400 --> 0:05:31.080
We mostly just require C language skills.

97
0:05:31.080 --> 0:05:34.480
I mean that's obviously the most important thing when you're working in the kernel.

98
0:05:34.480 --> 0:05:41.160
That's a basic Linux experience, some programming experience in general, but not need a ton

99
0:05:41.160 --> 0:05:43.360
of Linux kernel experience to get started.

100
0:05:43.360 --> 0:05:52.160
But really the most critical thing is C. So we teach kind of an overview of just various

101
0:05:52.160 --> 0:06:01.360
kernel features and subsystems, kind of describe a map of the kernel, what there is, how the

102
0:06:01.360 --> 0:06:05.280
different pieces connect together, how you can interact with it.

103
0:06:05.280 --> 0:06:10.360
We approach through device driver development, that's a good way to get people into, you

104
0:06:10.360 --> 0:06:14.040
know, to work with a lot of the different APIs, because to write a device driver you

105
0:06:14.040 --> 0:06:17.880
need to interact with a lot of different areas and you end up building something that's a

106
0:06:17.880 --> 0:06:21.560
somewhat kind of complete piece that works on its own.

107
0:06:21.560 --> 0:06:25.080
And then we introduce people to more advanced usage of Git.

108
0:06:25.080 --> 0:06:28.240
I mean people may be familiar with GitHub, but believe it or not, a lot of people don't

109
0:06:28.240 --> 0:06:30.960
know the difference between Git and GitHub.

110
0:06:30.960 --> 0:06:36.120
So we help out with that and get them started with email patches and rebases and things

111
0:06:36.120 --> 0:06:37.600
like that.

112
0:06:37.600 --> 0:06:42.000
We also talk about BPF trace and other tracing, which are things that they, I don't think

113
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:46.720
BPF trace, BPF in general is taught in any school that I know of, at least not in undergrad

114
0:06:46.720 --> 0:06:47.720
courses.

115
0:06:47.720 --> 0:06:53.040
You know, NCSCOPE and other ways to explore large projects and repositories because, you

116
0:06:53.040 --> 0:06:58.080
know, in a computer science program people generally don't get exposed to working on

117
0:06:58.080 --> 0:06:59.800
like large ongoing projects.

118
0:06:59.800 --> 0:07:04.160
You know, you work on some, you know, one and done thing and, you know, then you send

119
0:07:04.160 --> 0:07:06.880
it in and no one else looks at it and you get your grade and you move on, right?

120
0:07:06.880 --> 0:07:11.520
So we're introducing people to work on larger code bases, which is something that's somewhat

121
0:07:11.520 --> 0:07:13.560
unusual for a university course.

122
0:07:13.560 --> 0:07:17.920
So of course all these course materials and the assignments, completely open source.

123
0:07:17.920 --> 0:07:21.320
We've linked it, it's all on our website.

124
0:07:21.320 --> 0:07:22.880
And we're continuously improving it.

125
0:07:22.880 --> 0:07:24.840
You know, the source for the website is also on GitHub.

126
0:07:24.840 --> 0:07:30.480
You know, if anyone has any suggestions or changes, we're always open to them.

127
0:07:30.480 --> 0:07:34.280
So we have undergraduate and graduate level university courses that run on UMass Lowell

128
0:07:34.280 --> 0:07:37.000
that we've created over the past couple of years.

129
0:07:37.000 --> 0:07:41.340
It became kind of a full fledged course in the fall semester of last year.

130
0:07:41.340 --> 0:07:43.040
So it's relatively new.

131
0:07:43.040 --> 0:07:47.600
And this semester we're also running it as a kind of dual program with the Linux Foundation's

132
0:07:47.600 --> 0:07:50.040
mentorship platform.

133
0:07:50.040 --> 0:07:53.960
So we have people applying on there to, I will also talk a little bit more about that

134
0:07:53.960 --> 0:07:54.960
later.

135
0:07:54.960 --> 0:08:01.080
But they essentially run through the course and kind of work with, at the same schedule

136
0:08:01.080 --> 0:08:05.320
and at the same pace as the people at UMass Lowell, but they're from around the world

137
0:08:05.320 --> 0:08:07.200
and they don't need to be enrolled as students.

138
0:08:07.200 --> 0:08:08.200
They can come from anywhere.

139
0:08:08.200 --> 0:08:09.200
All right.

140
0:08:09.200 --> 0:08:13.520
And kind of the bottom line is we try to reimagine how to teach this kind of material from first

141
0:08:13.520 --> 0:08:16.880
principles because it doesn't really make sense to teach it from a typical, like memorize

142
0:08:16.880 --> 0:08:20.520
this and do the exam kind of perspective, right?

143
0:08:20.520 --> 0:08:25.800
The goal is to get people to be able to explain things in their own words and to work on open

144
0:08:25.800 --> 0:08:29.280
source projects and work in open source communities.

145
0:08:29.280 --> 0:08:33.720
So we've replaced exams with presentations where they actually explain the work that

146
0:08:33.720 --> 0:08:38.440
they've done in their own words to their peers.

147
0:08:38.440 --> 0:08:43.240
So from there we recruit people as interns and try to bring them in.

148
0:08:43.240 --> 0:08:49.680
So we find people in the course who are enthusiastic and capable.

149
0:08:49.680 --> 0:08:53.280
So by the time we bring them in to the internship, they also have a lot of prerequisite knowledge

150
0:08:53.280 --> 0:08:55.240
that they would need.

151
0:08:55.240 --> 0:08:59.320
And so they're able to hit the ground running and do a lot more in their three to six month

152
0:08:59.320 --> 0:09:05.080
period or longer than they otherwise would have because actually, so I had a, the manager

153
0:09:05.080 --> 0:09:09.400
who hired me at Red Hat originally as a co-op, he said he didn't like to do summer internships

154
0:09:09.400 --> 0:09:13.440
in the kernel because by the time three months are over, they've just gotten onboarded.

155
0:09:13.440 --> 0:09:17.960
They've just started to understand how to work with the Linux kernel and then it's over

156
0:09:17.960 --> 0:09:19.560
and then they got to go.

157
0:09:19.560 --> 0:09:20.960
So he only really did co-ops.

158
0:09:20.960 --> 0:09:24.320
But the goal with this is if we kind of vet people ahead of time and we give them the

159
0:09:24.320 --> 0:09:27.640
skills that they need and give them kind of, you know, to get skills and they compile

160
0:09:27.640 --> 0:09:32.440
the kernel and they have the background, they actually can get some value from an internship

161
0:09:32.440 --> 0:09:36.520
and we're more likely to bring people into internships who actually want to work in the

162
0:09:36.520 --> 0:09:40.160
kernel and then they're more likely to go off and work in the kernel in general or work

163
0:09:40.160 --> 0:09:43.320
in open source communities.

164
0:09:43.320 --> 0:09:47.880
So we pair them up with real engineers and they work on various initiatives within Red

165
0:09:47.880 --> 0:09:54.880
Hat that are, you know, that are, need people to learn these kind of new and, but combinations

166
0:09:54.880 --> 0:09:57.040
of old and new skills.

167
0:09:57.040 --> 0:10:01.320
But the goal is to train these new people to work in those areas.

168
0:10:01.320 --> 0:10:04.880
So we also bring them in to help with our program and we've had people come in, they

169
0:10:04.880 --> 0:10:07.760
take the course and then they come in and they turn around and then they're TAs and

170
0:10:07.760 --> 0:10:09.080
they work on improving the course.

171
0:10:09.080 --> 0:10:11.360
Maybe they do a couple lectures here and there.

172
0:10:11.360 --> 0:10:17.000
They do some grading and they kind of serve as TAs.

173
0:10:17.000 --> 0:10:22.080
So another thing that we are doing is we have this kind of new kernel devs group within

174
0:10:22.080 --> 0:10:24.680
Red Hat, which I thought I'll just briefly mention.

175
0:10:24.680 --> 0:10:28.840
It's a little bit tangential, but you know, once people get into Red Hat and when people

176
0:10:28.840 --> 0:10:35.360
are working in the kernel, especially in a remote job, which a lot of these positions

177
0:10:35.360 --> 0:10:39.040
are, people get very separated, they get very siloed.

178
0:10:39.040 --> 0:10:43.920
There's not a lot of socialization, so we run a group to, you know, just bring people

179
0:10:43.920 --> 0:10:47.560
together for a meeting with very little agenda.

180
0:10:47.560 --> 0:10:51.560
Occasionally we have a presentation here and there, but just to talk about things and share

181
0:10:51.560 --> 0:10:57.280
concepts and tools and questions and, you know, it's a Red Hat specific thing so they

182
0:10:57.280 --> 0:11:01.840
can ask about specific things related to their job and a place where, you know, there's,

183
0:11:01.840 --> 0:11:06.440
manners are allowed, but it's not a specific structured meeting for a business purpose.

184
0:11:06.440 --> 0:11:10.360
I think people who, you know, you might get that in an office somewhere when you're just

185
0:11:10.360 --> 0:11:14.640
walking around and talking to people, but it's a little bit more difficult to get when

186
0:11:14.640 --> 0:11:15.920
you're in a remote position.

187
0:11:15.920 --> 0:11:21.560
So we also bring interns who we've recruited into that group, you know, and people from

188
0:11:21.560 --> 0:11:25.680
elsewhere within Red Hat who are interested in the kernel and they can ask questions and

189
0:11:25.680 --> 0:11:30.680
find resources and, you know, if they enjoy it, they can switch into the kernel.

190
0:11:30.680 --> 0:11:34.480
There are actually a number of people who are interested and they just don't know where

191
0:11:34.480 --> 0:11:35.480
to start.

192
0:11:35.480 --> 0:11:40.000
There are just not a lot of good resources.

193
0:11:40.000 --> 0:11:45.480
So now I'll talk about some of the growth of this program over the last couple of years.

194
0:11:45.480 --> 0:11:49.360
So first of all, we've partnered with Red Hat's main educational initiative, Red Hat

195
0:11:49.360 --> 0:11:56.600
Academy, which we found out about only through doing this program, but they work with universities

196
0:11:56.600 --> 0:12:03.720
mainly on delivering and facilitating kind of systems management, you know, what do you

197
0:12:03.720 --> 0:12:08.360
call system administration and site reliability engineering, kind of the more, you know, the

198
0:12:08.360 --> 0:12:15.440
standard kind of Red Hat certifications that they do, but they don't have much software

199
0:12:15.440 --> 0:12:16.440
engineering.

200
0:12:16.440 --> 0:12:20.200
In fact, I don't think they had any software engineering component at all, so they were

201
0:12:20.200 --> 0:12:25.280
happy to work with us and, you know, were happy to work with them and they made us these

202
0:12:25.280 --> 0:12:30.240
nice posters, which we have down here if anyone's interested.

203
0:12:30.240 --> 0:12:33.880
Or I guess they're called like leave behind sheets technically, but no.

204
0:12:33.880 --> 0:12:39.920
We also ran a workshop last year for interns, co-ops in Ireland.

205
0:12:39.920 --> 0:12:43.280
And that was just kind of every other week, kind of a casual thing.

206
0:12:43.280 --> 0:12:47.080
You know, over time we had fewer and fewer people, to be honest, but the people who stayed

207
0:12:47.080 --> 0:12:51.720
around really enjoyed it and I think hopefully some of them will end up working in the space

208
0:12:51.720 --> 0:12:54.440
or, you know, open source generally.

209
0:12:54.440 --> 0:13:00.200
Hopefully they, the feedback for them was generally fairly positive.

210
0:13:00.200 --> 0:13:04.040
We've also been connecting to various educational programs in different countries.

211
0:13:04.040 --> 0:13:07.560
A lot of this stuff's very preliminary, but we're hoping to kind of package what we've

212
0:13:07.560 --> 0:13:12.480
done in our course in a way that can be replicated in other places, at other universities, in

213
0:13:12.480 --> 0:13:16.220
other countries to bring people in from different places in the world.

214
0:13:16.220 --> 0:13:20.080
And then we've also partnered with the Linux Foundation, specifically their mentorship

215
0:13:20.080 --> 0:13:24.520
platform, which I will talk about next.

216
0:13:24.520 --> 0:13:27.760
So like I was saying, the Linux Foundation.

217
0:13:27.760 --> 0:13:36.600
So we have just put our course on the Linux Foundation's platform essentially as a mentorship,

218
0:13:36.600 --> 0:13:39.760
but it's the same thing as the course.

219
0:13:39.760 --> 0:13:41.720
We've been worked with Shua Khan.

220
0:13:41.720 --> 0:13:43.400
She's been very helpful.

221
0:13:43.400 --> 0:13:48.360
She runs this Linux Foundation's mentorship platform and, you know, great person to get

222
0:13:48.360 --> 0:13:53.360
in touch with if you're interested in learning the kernel or have questions about this.

223
0:13:53.360 --> 0:13:57.280
She's also a kernel maintainer if you're not familiar.

224
0:13:57.280 --> 0:14:02.880
So we are running the same course, and this is kind of experimental.

225
0:14:02.880 --> 0:14:07.960
We're running the same schedule with the same assignments with a group who are doing the

226
0:14:07.960 --> 0:14:12.480
course for credit at UMass Lowell, and at the same time people who are just, they just

227
0:14:12.480 --> 0:14:16.680
apply it online and they're just doing it.

228
0:14:16.680 --> 0:14:19.080
They're people, you know, just on random continents.

229
0:14:19.080 --> 0:14:20.080
Some of them are students.

230
0:14:20.080 --> 0:14:21.320
Some of them are working.

231
0:14:21.320 --> 0:14:23.880
Some of them are doing, you know, I have no idea.

232
0:14:23.880 --> 0:14:28.080
Honestly, some of them are just probably, you know, having a good time.

233
0:14:28.080 --> 0:14:33.400
But they're doing the same assignments and on the same schedule, and, you know, they

234
0:14:33.400 --> 0:14:39.240
submit their assignments to a different mailing list than the UMass Lowell cohort, but they're

235
0:14:39.240 --> 0:14:45.120
in a shared Discord server and they're interacting, and, you know, we're seeing how that goes.

236
0:14:45.120 --> 0:14:47.000
And it's an extremely diverse group of mentees.

237
0:14:47.000 --> 0:14:52.160
We have people from, I think, like five different continents, you know, people from various

238
0:14:52.160 --> 0:14:57.240
places in Europe, a couple in America, South America, someone in Mexico, like three or

239
0:14:57.240 --> 0:15:00.400
four from Africa, Nigeria, Kenya.

240
0:15:00.400 --> 0:15:06.760
So very interesting group, a couple in India as well.

241
0:15:06.760 --> 0:15:09.600
So a couple of statistics on what we've been able to do.

242
0:15:09.600 --> 0:15:14.400
It's a fairly new program, but I am happy to show some results.

243
0:15:14.400 --> 0:15:20.320
We were able to hire two people full-time from internships who originally did the, went

244
0:15:20.320 --> 0:15:21.800
through the class.

245
0:15:21.800 --> 0:15:23.760
This was during the year that was very difficult to hire people.

246
0:15:23.760 --> 0:15:29.040
There was a hiring freeze, so I think two is still, it's a lot more than zero.

247
0:15:29.040 --> 0:15:33.360
Two people who did co-ops or internships with us were recruited to Amazon at Microsoft,

248
0:15:33.360 --> 0:15:36.760
but one of them liked Red Hat so much and liked working with Open Source so much better

249
0:15:36.760 --> 0:15:41.240
than Amazon that he is pretty interested in coming back, leaving Amazon and coming back

250
0:15:41.240 --> 0:15:43.960
to Red Hat, which is pretty cool.

251
0:15:43.960 --> 0:15:47.820
But overall, we've had seven interns and co-ops who have been trained and have gone through

252
0:15:47.820 --> 0:15:52.800
this particular program via this KDLP thing.

253
0:15:52.800 --> 0:15:55.760
And last semester, we had our biggest class, well, until this semester.

254
0:15:55.760 --> 0:16:01.160
We had 12 students, mostly graduate students, graduate and undergraduate courses are the

255
0:16:01.160 --> 0:16:04.920
same, which I found out, same content.

256
0:16:04.920 --> 0:16:07.840
And we have about a dozen, a couple more than a dozen students this semester.

257
0:16:07.840 --> 0:16:09.880
And the course is actively going on right now.

258
0:16:09.880 --> 0:16:12.200
It just started a couple weeks ago.

259
0:16:12.200 --> 0:16:16.720
And I think about a dozen in the LFX mentorship as well.

260
0:16:16.720 --> 0:16:23.640
And this is by far the most diverse group by gender and location, which is pretty interesting.

261
0:16:23.640 --> 0:16:27.640
So now just briefly some program information.

262
0:16:27.640 --> 0:16:30.000
So the team is, well, there's me.

263
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:31.240
Julie Denham is the program manager.

264
0:16:31.240 --> 0:16:36.360
I think she's in the chat answering questions if anyone's interested back in Boston.

265
0:16:36.360 --> 0:16:40.960
Charles Maraboule, he's a content lead for the course.

266
0:16:40.960 --> 0:16:45.880
And Dennis Alexandrov, he is an intern who's been extended and also TA.

267
0:16:45.880 --> 0:16:49.240
He's been working on the course since last summer.

268
0:16:49.240 --> 0:16:54.440
Originally went through the course from McGill University.

269
0:16:54.440 --> 0:16:55.440
And yeah, acknowledgments.

270
0:16:55.440 --> 0:17:00.640
I just want to give a shout out to two Red Hatters in particular.

271
0:17:00.640 --> 0:17:03.720
First Heidi Dempsey, the research and innovation director in North America.

272
0:17:03.720 --> 0:17:07.440
She's been a long time supporter of this program from the beginning, from like, you know, before

273
0:17:07.440 --> 0:17:11.120
I was even in an idea, you know, when we were talking about doing something in like February

274
0:17:11.120 --> 0:17:12.200
of 2019.

275
0:17:12.200 --> 0:17:15.000
So her support's been great.

276
0:17:15.000 --> 0:17:21.920
And you know, recommend, you know, doing research and innovation with her if anyone's, you know,

277
0:17:21.920 --> 0:17:22.920
interested in doing that.

278
0:17:22.920 --> 0:17:27.120
And of course Mike McGrath, the vice president of REL, who is the executive sponsor for this

279
0:17:27.120 --> 0:17:29.600
program within Red Hat.

280
0:17:29.600 --> 0:17:32.520
Now a couple resources.

281
0:17:32.520 --> 0:17:37.320
We have a mailing list, which is a link up there, which we pretty much just used for

282
0:17:37.320 --> 0:17:41.280
giving a quarterly update newsletter, which we just started this quarter.

283
0:17:41.280 --> 0:17:45.520
It's read only, so you're not going to get spammed with a ton of information.

284
0:17:45.520 --> 0:17:50.320
If you subscribe to that mailing list, you get invited to a weekly office hour session.

285
0:17:50.320 --> 0:17:55.920
That happens Tuesday at noon Eastern Standard Time, which just for asking questions about

286
0:17:55.920 --> 0:18:01.280
the program or the kernel in general, or you can just send me or one of us an email.

287
0:18:01.280 --> 0:18:03.080
And then on the right, we have our website.

288
0:18:03.080 --> 0:18:07.480
We have a section of our website that talks about the information that's specifically

289
0:18:07.480 --> 0:18:10.680
the structure and content of the course.

290
0:18:10.680 --> 0:18:14.840
We have the page on the UMass Law Catalog that talks about the course description.

291
0:18:14.840 --> 0:18:21.560
So in case anyone's interested in checking that out and the mentorship page on LFX.

292
0:18:21.560 --> 0:18:25.960
Then down there on the bottom right, we do have a crowdfunding page on LFX.

293
0:18:25.960 --> 0:18:32.320
If you want to support the program development and diverse engineers, it's a very, you know,

294
0:18:32.320 --> 0:18:37.200
we'll be able to bring people on through that platform as TA's potentially give them, you

295
0:18:37.200 --> 0:18:41.680
know, bring them on and continue them kind of beyond what we're able to do with just

296
0:18:41.680 --> 0:18:42.680
Red Hat.

297
0:18:42.680 --> 0:18:43.680
All right.

298
0:18:43.680 --> 0:18:44.680
Any questions?

299
0:18:44.680 --> 0:18:45.680
Hi.

300
0:18:45.680 --> 0:19:08.280
I think there is an offer on demand problem.

301
0:19:08.280 --> 0:19:14.520
If you consider every Linux kernel developers, it will be like 1000 JavaScript developers

302
0:19:14.520 --> 0:19:19.000
and also people at the university, if you give them the choice between JavaScript and

303
0:19:19.000 --> 0:19:23.240
Linux, they will have more opportunities going with the JavaScript.

304
0:19:23.240 --> 0:19:24.240
They cannot do a mistake.

305
0:19:24.240 --> 0:19:28.560
However, if they go with the kernel, like I don't know, in my country, for example,

306
0:19:28.560 --> 0:19:33.600
there's a lot less jobs and you have less opportunities.

307
0:19:33.600 --> 0:19:35.180
So what's your opinion on this?

308
0:19:35.180 --> 0:19:40.600
Because people know the choice between like classic software development and kernel software

309
0:19:40.600 --> 0:19:44.000
development.

310
0:19:44.000 --> 0:19:51.380
So if I understand that correctly, you're saying there's fewer jobs in the kernel.

311
0:19:51.380 --> 0:19:59.840
And so, you know, what would I say about just about what was like 1000 to one or something

312
0:19:59.840 --> 0:20:01.120
you said?

313
0:20:01.120 --> 0:20:04.200
Well, I mean, that's true.

314
0:20:04.200 --> 0:20:06.520
But the competition for those jobs is much more intense.

315
0:20:06.520 --> 0:20:11.240
It's much kind of broader, you know, skill area.

316
0:20:11.240 --> 0:20:15.680
I mean, it's definitely, you know, I'm not condemning JavaScript developers.

317
0:20:15.680 --> 0:20:16.680
JavaScript's fine.

318
0:20:16.680 --> 0:20:20.960
It's necessary, you know, the web runs on it for all its problems.

319
0:20:20.960 --> 0:20:26.800
But it's also true that, I mean, working in the kernel, you know, the Linux kernel, there

320
0:20:26.800 --> 0:20:32.840
are fewer jobs, but there are a number of very solid jobs.

321
0:20:32.840 --> 0:20:37.720
And it doesn't, learning Linux kernel skills is somewhat transferable to other areas of

322
0:20:37.720 --> 0:20:38.720
development.

323
0:20:38.720 --> 0:20:40.520
You don't have to work as a Linux kernel developer.

324
0:20:40.520 --> 0:20:45.240
You don't have to, you know, go to Red Hat and work on rel and do back ports or whatever.

325
0:20:45.240 --> 0:20:46.680
You can kind of just do it on your own.

326
0:20:46.680 --> 0:20:51.800
You can do, you know, just some other low-level project and just having knowledge of the kernel

327
0:20:51.800 --> 0:20:55.600
and how it works and the knowledge necessary to work on the kernel, I think, could benefit

328
0:20:55.600 --> 0:21:01.800
people in many other areas and just is an overall boost to people skills that is somewhat

329
0:21:01.800 --> 0:21:03.520
rare to find these days.

330
0:21:03.520 --> 0:21:06.840
So even for a JavaScript developer, if they know how the kernel works and if they know,

331
0:21:06.840 --> 0:21:12.320
you know, behind the scenes, you know, what's going on at a system level, I think that is,

332
0:21:12.320 --> 0:21:15.280
can't be anything but a good thing.

333
0:21:15.280 --> 0:21:23.000
Thanks for the talk.

334
0:21:23.000 --> 0:21:25.320
I have a question about the audience.

335
0:21:25.320 --> 0:21:31.440
So is it mainly targeting students at the college level and then partnering with university

336
0:21:31.440 --> 0:21:35.800
or do you also consider a conversion program like existing software developers that want

337
0:21:35.800 --> 0:21:39.320
to switch to more low-level kernel development?

338
0:21:39.320 --> 0:21:44.560
Yeah, so the course at UMass Lowell is, you know, a course at UMass Lowell.

339
0:21:44.560 --> 0:21:46.080
It's for people enrolled at UMass Lowell.

340
0:21:46.080 --> 0:21:49.560
But the program on LFX, the whole idea of putting it on there is that we could accept

341
0:21:49.560 --> 0:21:56.520
people from anywhere in the world doing anything, students, non-students, you know, U.S., non-U.S.,

342
0:21:56.520 --> 0:21:57.520
whatever.

343
0:21:57.520 --> 0:22:02.320
So any background, as long as they have some knowledge of C, good Internet access, decent

344
0:22:02.320 --> 0:22:06.920
English and a computer, then we can take them.

345
0:22:06.920 --> 0:22:12.160
The only limitation is our ability to grade the assignments and handle that many students

346
0:22:12.160 --> 0:22:14.400
and like the resources that we have to work on the program.

347
0:22:14.400 --> 0:22:19.080
Because this is, you know, for the three engineers and, you know, potentially a couple more people

348
0:22:19.080 --> 0:22:22.120
who are interested and, you know, a couple of interns, right, it's, this is all a side

349
0:22:22.120 --> 0:22:23.320
project for us.

350
0:22:23.320 --> 0:22:25.720
Like, I'm mainly a real engineer.

351
0:22:25.720 --> 0:22:26.720
That's my main job.

352
0:22:26.720 --> 0:22:28.520
Like, this is just a side project.

353
0:22:28.520 --> 0:22:31.960
So we don't have a ton of resources and, yeah, we're basically limited by how much time and

354
0:22:31.960 --> 0:22:35.200
resources we have to run the program.

355
0:22:35.200 --> 0:22:38.840
But we're, yeah, we encourage people to apply from all sorts of different backgrounds.

356
0:22:38.840 --> 0:22:39.840
Okay.

357
0:22:39.840 --> 0:22:42.680
Thank you.

358
0:22:42.680 --> 0:22:56.760
So, back in the day when I used to participate in development of kernel, it required us to

359
0:22:56.760 --> 0:22:59.880
basically build the entire main line.

360
0:22:59.880 --> 0:23:03.800
Your slide showed something with Raspberry Pis.

361
0:23:03.800 --> 0:23:09.120
Is it feasible to build the entire kernel using a Raspberry Pi?

362
0:23:09.120 --> 0:23:13.160
So that originally comes from, we used to do a lot more stuff with Raspberry Pis before

363
0:23:13.160 --> 0:23:14.160
the chip shortage.

364
0:23:14.160 --> 0:23:15.800
It became more difficult to get them.

365
0:23:15.800 --> 0:23:21.040
And then, you know, I think generally, like a lot of the introductory stuff we were doing

366
0:23:21.040 --> 0:23:23.160
didn't require them as much.

367
0:23:23.160 --> 0:23:25.520
So we moved somewhat away from them.

368
0:23:25.520 --> 0:23:30.040
But yes, we did work with Raspberry Pis and we were compiling the kernel on the Raspberry

369
0:23:30.040 --> 0:23:31.040
Pi.

370
0:23:31.040 --> 0:23:34.280
So I was able to do it on the three.

371
0:23:34.280 --> 0:23:36.600
It took a lot of weird tricks.

372
0:23:36.600 --> 0:23:39.960
It took like a day, you know, because I think it was like single threaded.

373
0:23:39.960 --> 0:23:42.680
And on the four, I could do it.

374
0:23:42.680 --> 0:23:44.160
It was a little bit faster.

375
0:23:44.160 --> 0:23:48.440
But if you didn't have cooling, the system would overheat unless you used fewer than

376
0:23:48.440 --> 0:23:49.700
four cores.

377
0:23:49.700 --> 0:23:51.000
But you can do it.

378
0:23:51.000 --> 0:23:52.940
And in fact, you can install Fedora.

379
0:23:52.940 --> 0:23:54.060
You can install CentOS.

380
0:23:54.060 --> 0:23:55.880
And you can install Realm.

381
0:23:55.880 --> 0:23:57.880
Yeah, I know that.

382
0:23:57.880 --> 0:23:59.760
Yeah, all right.

383
0:23:59.760 --> 0:24:00.760
That was my question.

384
0:24:00.760 --> 0:24:01.760
Thank you.

385
0:24:01.760 --> 0:24:27.360
Hey, you had said with the alternate, the non-university route for Doonit, you've got

386
0:24:27.360 --> 0:24:30.720
people here working at the same time, possibly.

387
0:24:30.720 --> 0:24:35.560
I was just wondering, since it's also got the same assignment schedule, what is the

388
0:24:35.560 --> 0:24:40.200
time commitment like for someone trying to get into it that might have full-time work?

389
0:24:40.200 --> 0:24:42.400
What is the time commitment like?

390
0:24:42.400 --> 0:24:47.760
Because it depends how quickly you complete the assignments.

391
0:24:47.760 --> 0:24:48.760
Okay.

392
0:24:48.760 --> 0:24:49.760
So it's...

393
0:24:49.760 --> 0:25:00.240
Well, the lectures are the sessions that we have, which are, you know, on Google Meet,

394
0:25:00.240 --> 0:25:01.240
they're also recorded.

395
0:25:01.240 --> 0:25:02.240
And then we post them.

396
0:25:02.240 --> 0:25:04.480
There are about two of them per week, generally.

397
0:25:04.480 --> 0:25:07.960
And they're each an hour and 15 minutes.

398
0:25:07.960 --> 0:25:11.880
And it goes for, you know, like a standard 12-week semester.

399
0:25:11.880 --> 0:25:17.760
In terms of the assignments, I mean, if you're, you know, I think at the beginning setting

400
0:25:17.760 --> 0:25:21.720
up the environment to send email patches if you haven't done that before and compiling

401
0:25:21.720 --> 0:25:22.720
the kernel.

402
0:25:22.720 --> 0:25:25.480
And, you know, we have one assignment where you write a shell.

403
0:25:25.480 --> 0:25:26.480
You know, that can be...

404
0:25:26.480 --> 0:25:31.560
I mean, yeah, it depends how familiar you are with some of the concepts.

405
0:25:31.560 --> 0:25:39.000
But I, you know, think of it as it's just like same commitment as, you know, maybe medium

406
0:25:39.000 --> 0:25:44.320
to like junior to senior level undergraduate computer science course, approximately.

407
0:25:44.320 --> 0:25:47.520
I mean, that's how we're designing it.

408
0:25:47.520 --> 0:25:48.520
Sure.

409
0:25:48.520 --> 0:25:49.520
Hiya.

410
0:25:49.520 --> 0:25:53.520
Thanks for the talk.

411
0:25:53.520 --> 0:25:59.760
Any of these courses, like I'm curious about backporting and forwardporting stuff.

412
0:25:59.760 --> 0:26:04.760
So when you're doing this course work, are you working on a specific version of the kernel?

413
0:26:04.760 --> 0:26:07.920
Like, yeah, this course is going to be on 6.2.

414
0:26:07.920 --> 0:26:13.640
Because I find that a lot of problems that I run into is, okay, this driver was just

415
0:26:13.640 --> 0:26:15.680
introduced, let's say, in October.

416
0:26:15.680 --> 0:26:18.280
But I need it on 5.13.

417
0:26:18.280 --> 0:26:19.800
So I need to backport it.

418
0:26:19.800 --> 0:26:21.880
And that might be trivial, right?

419
0:26:21.880 --> 0:26:23.520
Might just be copying some files.

420
0:26:23.520 --> 0:26:28.880
But if the API has changed in some way, it can be really difficult to figure out how

421
0:26:28.880 --> 0:26:29.880
it changed.

422
0:26:29.880 --> 0:26:33.000
Because the documentation, to my knowledge, is not great there.

423
0:26:33.000 --> 0:26:39.280
So is that something that you actually sort of discuss in these courses?

424
0:26:39.280 --> 0:26:42.560
We haven't done backporting specifically.

425
0:26:42.560 --> 0:26:46.560
We don't have any assignments that specifically ask for backports.

426
0:26:46.560 --> 0:26:52.280
Because we design them in a way that each student is doing relatively unique work.

427
0:26:52.280 --> 0:26:56.840
So it's kind of, and they're all posting it in a public mailing list.

428
0:26:56.840 --> 0:27:01.920
So we need to figure out how we can kind of either generate assignments or figure out

429
0:27:01.920 --> 0:27:09.560
assignments that are basically, by design, difficult to impossible to cheat in.

430
0:27:09.560 --> 0:27:11.960
And so with backporting, we could figure something out.

431
0:27:11.960 --> 0:27:13.120
We haven't really looked into it.

432
0:27:13.120 --> 0:27:17.600
We talk about Git Cherry Pick and Rebase, and we talk about the background that you

433
0:27:17.600 --> 0:27:18.920
would need to do that.

434
0:27:18.920 --> 0:27:24.160
And I think we may have done a demonstration of it in the course.

435
0:27:24.160 --> 0:27:28.280
But that's a good idea.

436
0:27:28.280 --> 0:27:30.320
OK.

437
0:27:30.320 --> 0:27:41.520
Do you anticipate that recent admission of Rust as a programming language, at least for

438
0:27:41.520 --> 0:27:46.840
driver development in the Linux kernel, will cause renewed interest, especially among younger

439
0:27:46.840 --> 0:27:47.840
talent?

440
0:27:47.840 --> 0:27:50.360
And are you already anticipating for that in the program?

441
0:27:50.360 --> 0:27:51.360
Potentially, yeah.

442
0:27:51.360 --> 0:27:54.360
We've discussed it, and we've heard some people talking about it.

443
0:27:54.360 --> 0:27:58.440
We had a few people who were in the course who were excited about Rust and Rust in the

444
0:27:58.440 --> 0:27:59.440
kernel.

445
0:27:59.440 --> 0:28:01.920
So we have seen some interest in the kernel.

446
0:28:01.920 --> 0:28:07.320
Probably, yeah, it's probably increased interest from young people, I would say.

447
0:28:07.320 --> 0:28:09.120
But personally, I need to learn Rust.

448
0:28:09.120 --> 0:28:11.120
I don't know Rust.

449
0:28:11.120 --> 0:28:12.120
But I'm ready to see it.

450
0:28:12.120 --> 0:28:13.120
Thank you.

451
0:28:13.120 --> 0:28:14.120
Thank you.

452
0:28:14.120 --> 0:28:15.120
All right.

453
0:28:15.120 --> 0:28:16.120
Here, help me to promote something specific.

454
0:28:16.120 --> 0:28:17.120
Do you mind if anyone... Oh, sure.

455
0:28:17.120 --> 0:28:18.120
Yeah, they're here, but people take us with business cards.

456
0:28:18.120 --> 0:28:19.120
Thanks.

457
0:28:19.120 --> 0:28:20.120
Thanks so much.

458
0:28:50.120 --> 0:28:54.120
And then, yes, build it with some sort of a similar challenge.

459
0:28:54.120 --> 0:28:58.120
Something like that, you know, to get a way of that.

460
0:28:58.120 --> 0:29:00.120
But you have to do that challenge.

461
0:29:00.120 --> 0:29:04.120
That was like the way you were asked, you know, if you were

462
0:29:04.120 --> 0:29:08.120
on vice drivers and then you were on the car and you were on

463
0:29:08.120 --> 0:28:57.880
the

464
0:29:08.120 --> 0:29:10.120
patches and actually you were on the flight.

465
0:29:10.120 --> 0:29:16.120
So they were teaching us this since, I think it's not going to be more.

466
0:29:16.120 --> 0:29:21.120
But I think that's a good thing.

467
0:29:21.120 --> 0:29:22.120
I'm sorry, let me get the mic wasn't you?

468
0:29:22.120 --> 0:29:23.120
Oh, okay, yeah.

469
0:29:23.120 --> 0:29:24.120
Yeah.

470
0:29:24.120 --> 0:29:25.120
Yeah.

471
0:29:25.120 --> 0:29:26.120
Yeah.

472
0:29:26.120 --> 0:29:55.120
Thanks a lot.
