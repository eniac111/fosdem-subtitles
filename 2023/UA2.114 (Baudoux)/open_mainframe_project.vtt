00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Thank you.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.300
Welcome to my presentation.

00:08.300 --> 00:12.720
Upstream collaboration and Linux distribution collaboration is that excluded.

00:12.720 --> 00:19.680
In my case, I am representing two projects, OPMSUSE where I am a member and a representative

00:19.680 --> 00:24.080
and then the OPM mainframe project where I am leading the Linux distribution working

00:24.080 --> 00:31.280
group with the most important Linux distribution included who are running on the mainframe.

00:31.280 --> 00:42.000
I am Sarah Krij and my agenda is first something about myself, how I came to this topic, then

00:42.000 --> 00:48.120
you should receive a short introduction about mainframes and the mainframe project, what

00:48.120 --> 00:53.920
that is and what we are providing, then why we have founded the Linux distribution working

00:53.920 --> 01:00.520
group from that we are coming to the topic of the reason why we wanted to collaborate.

01:00.520 --> 01:09.600
And in the last step, I want to tell how we are including upstream projects at the moment

01:09.600 --> 01:16.520
and what we want to achieve and I want to receive a little bit feedback in the Q&A session

01:16.520 --> 01:24.400
and how you as open source projects want to be included in such architecture specific

01:24.400 --> 01:30.280
working groups or collaboration projects then.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.400
About myself a little bit, I am an OPMSUSE contributor since around 10 years and I am

01:35.400 --> 01:41.200
also a member of a release engineering team and I am responsible for the S390X architecture

01:41.200 --> 01:48.840
and I am also a team lead for S390X at OPMSUSE. I wrote my bachelor thesis at IBM and afterwards

01:48.840 --> 01:54.400
I became a dev consultant at Accenture. I am also allowed to contribute a little bit

01:54.400 --> 02:01.440
to open source via my job but anyway I had this idea then to found the Linux distribution

02:01.440 --> 02:08.440
working group and I am with that also the co-chair of this Linux distribution working

02:08.440 --> 02:16.680
group. Mainframes perhaps not everybody knows them. That is the latest is the 16 system

02:16.680 --> 02:24.120
on the right side that mainframes are large high performance computer systems and are

02:24.120 --> 02:32.360
also called big endians. The architecture behind IBMC is the S390X architecture. The

02:32.360 --> 02:40.520
S390X came at the end for the 64 bit architecture which is also included in such a system and

02:40.520 --> 02:47.000
such systems are used for mission critical data for banking services and everything else

02:47.000 --> 02:55.280
and you can run thousands of PMS on such a system. The open mainframe project is our

02:55.280 --> 03:04.240
open hardware project for the mainframe and it has been funded in the year 2015 and this

03:04.240 --> 03:09.000
project is under the hood of the Linux foundation and should have a focal point for deployments

03:09.000 --> 03:15.320
and the usage of Linux and open source in our mainframe computing environment. Therefore

03:15.320 --> 03:21.720
we have got multiple mainframe centric projects where I will not explain all the projects

03:21.720 --> 03:28.720
because time is a little bit missing but we have got also a mentor program included.

03:28.720 --> 03:39.800
Some have known before but most projects are more COS based. Therefore it is no surprise

03:39.800 --> 03:48.600
that we have funded our Linux distribution working group inside this open mainframe project

03:48.600 --> 03:55.480
also and besides of that we have got also a COBOY working group and a COS enablement

03:55.480 --> 04:02.960
working group. COS is an alternative operating by IBM and a little bit commercial but IBM

04:02.960 --> 04:10.000
is working on it to provide also open source projects for that. Here we can see a little

04:10.000 --> 04:19.400
bit the overview of all included Linux distributions. SUSE, Red Hat and Ubuntu have joined after

04:19.400 --> 04:27.560
the community Linux distributions with Debian, OpenSUSE and Fedora. SUSE is our sponsor of

04:27.560 --> 04:34.040
the Linux distribution working group and when also Rocky Linux and Ima Linux have joined

04:34.040 --> 04:42.360
for words. Our structure, Elizabeth and I, we had the idea to found this Linux distribution

04:42.360 --> 04:49.840
working group at the IBM CDay two years ago and then we said we don't want to have it

04:49.840 --> 04:57.480
only for one or two Linux distributions, we want to have it for all that we can achieve

04:57.480 --> 05:04.000
better support and better collaboration between all of them. Then we said we want to have

05:04.000 --> 05:09.120
a minimum of one representative for every Linux distribution that is required for the

05:09.120 --> 05:17.880
input from the distribution site and yes SUSE said we want to sponsor it. Our goals are

05:17.880 --> 05:23.440
creating a place for collaboration across Linux distributions via the open mainframe

05:23.440 --> 05:32.520
project mailing list, the Wiki and the Tread. Then we wanted to provide a space for distributions

05:32.520 --> 05:41.400
to request for help on their S390 exports if there is something not working or anything

05:41.400 --> 05:50.120
else like that and then we had also the goal to ensure any and all infrastructure required

05:50.120 --> 05:55.200
should be available for supporting reports. Therefore you can request hardware and everything

05:55.200 --> 06:04.200
else. Dejan has got his own mainframe as an example. You can request support from the

06:04.200 --> 06:10.080
Linux one community cloud. I have got also a slide about that included and then I said

06:10.080 --> 06:17.480
I want to have better support from IBM to fix S390 specific bugs. We have got the distinguished

06:17.480 --> 06:26.360
engineer Ulrich Weigen included here for that and therefore we are collaborating via the

06:26.360 --> 06:34.720
mailing list with him and our meeting sessions then. Our collaborative process is in the

06:34.720 --> 06:40.240
first step the problem discussions on the mailing list. If anything is happening we

06:40.240 --> 06:48.680
can discuss the problems, we can reproduce issues sometimes in other Linux distributions,

06:48.680 --> 06:55.960
discuss it on the mailing list and then we are forwarding issues and ideas of improvements

06:55.960 --> 07:03.680
for IBM that will be forwarded when internally and then we have got also monthly meetings

07:03.680 --> 07:09.960
for half an hour every month. That is more come together with a review what has happened

07:09.960 --> 07:16.360
in the month and what are the next steps, any other problems or any other news and then

07:16.360 --> 07:23.520
we are sharing our knowledge also in this half an hour time. This collaboration is also

07:23.520 --> 07:31.160
a benefit for all with that upstream contributions are available for all that is lowering all

07:31.160 --> 07:38.920
the research and development costs because we have got our point of contacts where there

07:38.920 --> 07:45.040
is an exchange between distributions we can come faster forward and that is a benefit

07:45.040 --> 07:53.560
for IBM and the community. Additionally we have got the same solutions for our Linux

07:53.560 --> 07:59.400
distributions we can use the patches from Deviant, Fedora, OpenSoup, ShareIt, bring

07:59.400 --> 08:07.120
it upstream, test it together and with that we have got also same solutions for S3.9,

08:07.120 --> 08:14.040
specific problems. We share our knowledge between the communities equal to here we have

08:14.040 --> 08:24.480
got one Devroom together and sharing our knowledge here that is also in our working group. Then

08:24.480 --> 08:31.480
we are increasing a little bit also innovation we have got diverse community ideas we can

08:31.480 --> 08:41.240
bring it together and can forward it and bring the latest technologies into our Linux distributions

08:41.240 --> 08:49.520
and with that we are accelerating all the Linux development for S3.9.0X. From that if

08:49.520 --> 08:55.560
we are working together I would say we can achieve more together than alone and that

08:55.560 --> 09:04.080
is also the reason that IBM is providing the Linux one open source software community cloud

09:04.080 --> 09:10.880
you can receive the M's on Linux one systems that is also a mainframe for Linux configuration

09:10.880 --> 09:17.840
that is sponsored by IBM in the United States and the Linux one community cloud provides

09:17.840 --> 09:27.460
120 days for a single open source contributors with the free access you are receiving Sless

09:27.460 --> 09:34.320
or Ubuntu there and then we are providing also long term access for open source projects.

09:34.320 --> 09:41.040
In our case we have got five VMs for open source available and we maintain it for our

09:41.040 --> 09:47.200
own we have upgraded Sless to OpenSoup on that and with that we can develop also an

09:47.200 --> 09:59.320
open source foundation. With that we are coming to the idea to include the upstream projects

09:59.320 --> 10:07.320
it is easy to include base projects like the Linux kernel compilers like GCC or KVM because

10:07.320 --> 10:16.000
we have got already developers at IBM who are contributing their S maintainers and they

10:16.000 --> 10:23.840
can interact directly on our issues and back reports but there are many other projects

10:23.840 --> 10:29.680
in Linux included not only the kernel not only tool train and everything else we are

10:29.680 --> 10:39.160
receiving new programming languages we are using a latest databases or anything else

10:39.160 --> 10:48.440
the Linux world is really wide. This is an example how we have done that in the GCC back

10:48.440 --> 10:59.240
tracker we can create a back report that is arriving and then as an example IBM developer

10:59.240 --> 11:08.840
is interacting on it and analyzing it and creates a fix. The process at GCC is upstream

11:08.840 --> 11:16.240
back report IBM maintainers are receiving all S390X specific bugs and the maintainers

11:16.240 --> 11:25.280
are interacting. One hint in this direction these developers are also open for joining

11:25.280 --> 11:33.560
our Linux distribution working group for discussions but from our point of view that is not enough

11:33.560 --> 11:43.520
because there are many other projects an example is core what I have created an issue last

11:43.520 --> 11:51.160
month because of the S390X enablement which was not working I created on GitHub my issue

11:51.160 --> 12:00.880
the developer tried to fix it and said I don't know how to fix it I don't know S390X specific

12:00.880 --> 12:08.600
things I asked when should I forward it to IBM yes please I wrote my email to the mailing

12:08.600 --> 12:15.960
list with a swag and the distinguished engineer has interacted when news directly that has

12:15.960 --> 12:27.240
to that is the problem and it and it has been working but such a process is a little bit

12:27.240 --> 12:35.240
longer and requires as Linux distribution maintainers in this case should we include

12:35.240 --> 12:43.000
it as such project also with invitations to our mailing list or is this our responsibility

12:43.000 --> 12:53.080
to forward that from the upstream project to IBM then that is a question where the reasons

12:53.080 --> 13:01.280
for such required forwarding is that there are so many open source projects everywhere

13:01.280 --> 13:09.200
I think it does not know all the Linux integrated software and latest technologies especially

13:09.200 --> 13:16.760
the new ones and most IBM maintainers are only available for the base projects which

13:16.760 --> 13:24.880
are called strategic open source projects which is a bit funny but in any way they have

13:24.880 --> 13:33.360
got their strategic projects that maintainers are working on that and that's it if anything

13:33.360 --> 13:44.080
new is coming in they have to find someone responsible new for that one and yes we the

13:44.080 --> 13:51.280
Linux distribution maintainers know our requirements and what we want to include as the latest

13:51.280 --> 13:58.480
technologies therefore we want to achieve a new connection between IBM and upstream

13:58.480 --> 14:06.920
projects what is missing at the moment if you are interested for joining us as an upstream

14:06.920 --> 14:13.680
project or anything else we are open for that now here's our Wiki link of the mainframe

14:13.680 --> 14:19.760
project with the Linux distribution working group then we have got our mailing list and

14:19.760 --> 14:28.440
our meeting sessions on soon every second Tuesday the invitations are coming via the

14:28.440 --> 14:36.920
mailing list and now I want to use the rest of the time for discussions how do you want

14:36.920 --> 14:46.840
to become involved into such architecture specific working groups as an upstream project

14:46.840 --> 14:52.920
one hint there are also other collaborate distribution collaboration mailing lists

14:52.920 --> 15:01.160
available now two weeks ago we have received an email yes one from the kernel then I have

15:01.160 --> 15:08.640
seen this there's something for security topics yes there's also for architecture by the narrow

15:08.640 --> 15:16.120
I believe one collaboration mailing list something like that exists already but what is your

15:16.120 --> 15:21.200
expectation and how do you want to be included if you have got problems with architecture

15:21.200 --> 15:46.960
specific problems have you got any wishes Ben say here nothing

15:46.960 --> 16:06.640
yeah by the way the your consistent branding across the various sub projects that you had

16:06.640 --> 16:11.840
on the other slide is I just want to compliment it's really nice like their way they're all

16:11.840 --> 16:18.400
using the same palette and wait sorry I didn't mess up your slide system it seems I have

16:18.400 --> 16:26.000
got the human TCC and everything else no no no the various things under the open mainframe

16:26.000 --> 16:41.800
group we've lost the slides now though anyway yes I think that's super cool I love it I

16:41.800 --> 16:47.600
love it so the distributions you had in there so I noticed you had for or in there and I

16:47.600 --> 16:55.360
saw right hat mentioned so does that is that mean well as involved or we have got one person

16:55.360 --> 17:03.080
for a fit or a and read it that is done here a rock okay that is one person for both and

17:03.080 --> 17:10.480
we have for yes that is also involved if we want to give something forward to rat head

17:10.480 --> 17:22.400
when done for a person I am for opens with available is as user has got mark post continuously

17:22.400 --> 17:28.400
who is retiring at the moment and that is the reason that we have got two persons from

17:28.400 --> 17:37.000
through the that the follower will receive his introduction related as 390 x where and

17:37.000 --> 17:44.080
then we have got one person from the event perhaps I should go into our wiki page but

17:44.080 --> 18:07.720
we are receiving a better overview bear

18:07.720 --> 18:31.360
why does it not share it

18:31.360 --> 18:55.360
then yeah we have got as as something about all you know distributions and with all information

18:55.360 --> 19:03.400
about our architecture specific the mailing lists and everything else and who is responsible

19:03.400 --> 19:13.520
for what done is listed here opens who is listed here but I am responsible for distributions

19:13.520 --> 19:21.800
okay Linux is listed here with Luis are we and most of our guests in and then we are

19:21.800 --> 19:27.760
have got also our meeting session aside where you are receiving overview with attending

19:27.760 --> 19:33.920
all our meetings therefore here you can see also the debut responsible person the pack

19:33.920 --> 19:42.600
super nuclei is when you guys have from through the responsible for s3 90x who is joining

19:42.600 --> 19:51.960
our sessions the other it is on is the city over open source by IBM where I find is a

19:51.960 --> 19:59.280
distinguished engineer for open source and Linux therefore these persons are mostly the

19:59.280 --> 20:06.960
default persons joining us down is only listed for fedora because he has joints as a fedora

20:06.960 --> 20:15.400
representative but he is also responsible for s3 90x at redhead as I default cause just

20:15.400 --> 20:21.160
I am with a sent to us project and we sit kind of midstream between fedora and rounds

20:21.160 --> 20:24.640
I just want to like you know should we be getting involved or is it is it enough that

20:24.640 --> 20:33.600
we have fedora involved so I will talk to our fedora person yes my wish was as I default

20:33.600 --> 20:38.960
to different persons because we have also separated opens with a ensue in our case

20:38.960 --> 20:47.480
I asked multiple times at redhead can we receive an additional person yes I will forward it

20:47.480 --> 20:53.920
and nothing has happened and then Dan said I'm also from redhead okay when you are for

20:53.920 --> 21:03.240
both we are open to have an additional person from redheads but in general okay I will forward

21:03.240 --> 21:28.560
it yes if we have got from every distribution one person why not

21:28.560 --> 21:43.600
to like upstream maintainer if you if you want to support x3 90 like what will be the

21:43.600 --> 21:52.720
best way to kind of do it so could we just document like some contact points for like

21:52.720 --> 22:00.480
your group so like we can see we can say like if we have some some issues with supporting

22:00.480 --> 22:08.800
the extra 90 architecture I can just I'll say if we can fix it ourselves try to to to

22:08.800 --> 22:16.400
follow follow up with with with your working group and I guess that's our goal what we

22:16.400 --> 22:23.040
want to provide as a first step we have got our mailing list if you have got any problems

22:23.040 --> 22:31.560
or anything else you can write to us and we look how we can support you okay I am people

22:31.560 --> 22:37.760
who are required are also on this mailing list and they interact closed into two hours

22:37.760 --> 22:45.240
or something like that on the issues which are coming in and therefore that's our first

22:45.240 --> 22:50.440
step how we want to include you you are we are also open to include you in our meeting

22:50.440 --> 22:57.000
sessions when but that would be the first step how we can include you okay so the the

22:57.000 --> 23:05.840
preferred I guess point of contact for you will be for them in our internal development

23:05.840 --> 23:12.400
document it depends on which upstream project you are which one is that for example python

23:12.400 --> 23:20.800
that is python when a python I expect there there should be also a point of contact upstream

23:20.800 --> 23:28.640
from IBM yeah yeah but he does not they don't know the whole module things exactly that

23:28.640 --> 23:35.680
is the problem therefore forward the issues and problems and when you are receiving the

23:35.680 --> 23:43.840
support yeah that makes sense any further questions there's when we are perhaps two

23:43.840 --> 23:56.520
minutes it seems the people from the next session are joining now thank you that you

23:56.520 --> 24:08.400
have tried my presentation awesome thank you
