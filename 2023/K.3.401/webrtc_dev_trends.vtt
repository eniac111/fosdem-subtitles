WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
This is actually my first time at FOSDEM.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.920
I've been meaning to come here for many,

00:11.920 --> 00:13.600
many years since I will.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.720
Lorenzo been bothering me that I should come here and speak.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.560
So I'm glad actually I finally made it.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.980
I run a blog, WebRcHacks for developers.

00:23.980 --> 00:28.860
I got a lot of guest authors and I hope readers in the audience here.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.700
You might also recognize me if you watch

00:31.700 --> 00:34.180
YouTube videos about WebRc stuff or do

00:34.180 --> 00:37.560
an event series and videos at Cranky Geek.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.880
But today, I'm here to talk about some trends I did by

00:43.880 --> 00:46.360
analyzing GitHub and some other repositories.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.120
I'll talk about that in a second.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.640
But before we start,

00:48.640 --> 00:50.840
what are some things that would be nice to

00:50.840 --> 00:52.600
know what's going on in the industry?

00:52.600 --> 00:56.240
I'm an analyst like to watch this stuff and write about it.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.800
So one, is the community still growing?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.440
What are some of the interesting projects?

01:00.440 --> 01:02.080
What are some of the new trends?

01:02.080 --> 01:06.040
Are people using things like WebCodecs yet or not?

01:06.040 --> 01:08.720
So how do you go about doing that?

01:08.720 --> 01:12.360
Well, I came up with a methodology.

01:12.360 --> 01:18.520
It's largely based on BigQuery and there's a bunch of providers

01:18.520 --> 01:22.680
give data to BigQuery or make their datasets public available there.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.640
So you can grab that.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.720
GitHub is definitely the best one,

01:25.720 --> 01:28.520
basically any time, any public repo,

01:28.520 --> 01:30.200
anytime you do any kind of commit,

01:30.200 --> 01:36.360
pull request issue that all gets sent and stored in a BigQuery database.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.960
There's actually some other datasets that are cool in there too.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.520
I've used in the past and I actually used Stack Overflow in this one.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.240
I often cross-reference that with other sources like

01:46.240 --> 01:50.000
there's the Chrome platform status is a good way to see what

01:50.000 --> 01:54.920
actual APIs are being used at least in the Chrome world.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.760
So you get all that data.

01:57.760 --> 02:00.760
I actually like to use Colab which is just

02:00.760 --> 02:05.800
a Google's hosted Jupyter Notebook type ecosystem

02:05.800 --> 02:07.920
to do the analysis and follow things and then when I get

02:07.920 --> 02:13.640
frustrated about coding and doing stuff like making charts with Python,

02:13.640 --> 02:16.760
then I fall back to Excel for quick analysis.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.320
So some of the hard things about this and important to keep in

02:19.320 --> 02:21.440
mind about the analysis, you can't see it there.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.000
But all this is really based on regular expressions and pulling out

02:26.000 --> 02:34.040
keywords to identify a repo as WebRTC or something as one term or another.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.800
So that obviously has some flaws because there'd be false hits in there,

02:37.800 --> 02:39.360
and you have to be careful with your selection.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.120
So a lot of time I spend is actually just going

02:41.120 --> 02:43.160
through looking at the data and make sure it's not junk.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.800
I found in the past there's a lot of bots.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.000
So you got to remove those things and these datasets themselves aren't perfect.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.040
There's always missing data or junk data.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.080
So keep that in mind.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.560
But I've been doing this occasionally,

02:57.560 --> 02:59.480
more frequently now since 2015.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.640
I've been tweaking the methodology along the way.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.720
It's held up so far,

03:03.720 --> 03:06.400
but always open to feedback.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.480
So let's just dive in. How are we doing here in WebRTC?

03:10.480 --> 03:13.600
So this just looks since 2019.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.400
I don't think it's a big surprise to anyone,

03:16.400 --> 03:19.320
but there was a peak during the pandemic.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.680
So you can see here it's actually April of that year.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.440
This particular graph shows distinct users.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.880
So anybody had anyone on GitHub,

03:29.880 --> 03:33.720
just based on unique GitHub IDs per period in there.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.960
So that was over 10,000 in April.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.280
But if you look here, actually,

03:37.280 --> 03:38.560
we're not doing so bad.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.600
This is a bad data that was missing that month.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.160
We're not actually doing so bad here,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.600
but we're only about 60 percent a past peak.

03:47.600 --> 03:52.880
So it's still pretty above where we were before the pandemic.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.400
But another thing I find actually very interesting is,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.680
also because you can look at these events,

03:58.680 --> 04:00.240
who's actually contributing?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.320
You can look at the blog.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.240
I'll have some links to more on the methodology.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.440
But essentially, people doing pull requests,

04:07.440 --> 04:09.040
pull request reviews,

04:09.040 --> 04:12.520
that sort of thing that counts as a contributor.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.040
And actual contributors, if you believe that,

04:15.040 --> 04:18.480
are actually up more than ever.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.440
So first, one interesting point here,

04:21.440 --> 04:24.600
you can see I show there was a peak number of users in April,

04:24.600 --> 04:27.640
but actually the peak contributions was in actually May.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.760
And maybe that makes sense.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.840
Like people during a pandemic,

04:30.840 --> 04:33.080
got interested in WebRCH sees, start looking at it,

04:33.080 --> 04:37.040
they maybe could star a repo,

04:37.040 --> 04:38.160
join it, get involved.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.320
But then it takes them a few weeks actually

04:40.320 --> 04:41.680
before they actually contribute,

04:41.680 --> 04:44.080
start adding things into that repo.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.520
But as I said here,

04:45.520 --> 04:48.760
actually our most recent peak here was actually in August.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.360
And we're not actually too far

04:50.360 --> 04:51.960
off for the rest of the year looking at that.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.800
So I want to look in to see what was going

04:53.800 --> 04:56.960
on and compare these two peaks.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.360
So one is, this is actually from the August peak,

05:01.360 --> 05:02.920
I dug into the sea,

05:02.920 --> 05:04.560
where some of the repos that were actually

05:04.560 --> 05:06.840
having had the most activity.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.720
And one of them, very popular WebRCH project is CoTurn,

05:10.720 --> 05:14.720
the open source kind of stone and turn server.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.040
And actually one of my coworkers, Gustavo,

05:18.040 --> 05:18.880
took over that project.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.360
So I asked him what was going on here,

05:20.360 --> 05:24.400
what happened, why did we have such a big spike in this?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.040
And I wrote a whole blog post about it.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.520
But essentially, that project was kind of stale,

05:30.520 --> 05:32.320
not a lot of activity for a while.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.160
He and Pavel took that over

05:36.160 --> 05:38.520
and then started really get the community involved

05:38.520 --> 05:40.280
and there's a huge spike.

05:40.280 --> 05:44.360
And things were so then I wondered is,

05:44.360 --> 05:47.120
basically is this, sorry,

05:47.120 --> 05:50.560
is the peak the other peaks like in August in here,

05:50.560 --> 05:51.760
are they because of spikes

05:51.760 --> 05:53.600
or is there a lot of like regular activity?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.000
I mean, you can see here, there's,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.240
interestingly you see things like AdGuard

05:59.440 --> 06:00.320
is always high in there,

06:00.320 --> 06:02.560
like people actually applying to block WebRCH

06:02.560 --> 06:03.600
and its usage, right?

06:03.600 --> 06:07.960
But they have a lot of activity every month around that.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.560
But actually it wasn't actually,

06:09.560 --> 06:12.800
you see some commonality, but some difference here.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.640
And, whoa, sorry.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.200
But when you actually look at the distributions

06:18.200 --> 06:21.240
and the change between April of 2020

06:21.240 --> 06:23.360
and August of 2022,

06:23.360 --> 06:25.160
the actual distributions across the top 10,

06:25.160 --> 06:26.760
top 20, top 100,

06:26.760 --> 06:29.320
they're actually not a whole lot different.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.680
So what does this all mean?

06:31.680 --> 06:33.080
It's like actually the WebRCH development

06:33.080 --> 06:36.080
actually not really getting a lot more concentrated.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
You can look for a given period of time,

06:37.480 --> 06:39.600
obviously some projects are doing more popular

06:39.600 --> 06:42.440
and doing well, have more activity than others.

06:42.440 --> 06:45.440
But overall, it's not like we're consolidating down

06:45.440 --> 06:46.440
to a few projects, right?

06:46.440 --> 06:51.440
It's the same kind of more equal distribution that's existed

06:51.840 --> 06:53.280
at least for several years now.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.800
So another dataset,

06:56.800 --> 06:59.660
and this is actually a new one I hadn't looked at before,

06:59.660 --> 07:01.760
is Stack Overflow.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.040
So I zoomed in to take a look at that.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.040
And that's to see if this follows a similar pattern.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.120
Now, bear in mind compared to the previous charts,

07:11.120 --> 07:13.160
this goes back all the way to 2012,

07:13.160 --> 07:14.920
so it's a much longer data period.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.840
And you can see here,

07:17.700 --> 07:20.520
this is comments on Stack Overflow questions

07:20.520 --> 07:23.280
and actually the questions themselves.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.720
And unfortunately you can't see the font too much

07:26.720 --> 07:29.000
of answers within Stack Overflow,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.820
but it essentially looks very similar

07:30.820 --> 07:33.000
to the questions side of things.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.620
And you can see very similar here, peak in April of 2020.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.560
Also, unlike the GitHub analysis,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.160
this actually shows a peak

07:47.480 --> 07:50.760
is here also in April of 2022.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.360
I didn't have a chance to dig into to see

07:52.360 --> 07:55.760
what was driving that particular peak this year.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.120
But overall, I think you can see,

07:58.120 --> 07:59.640
it's a little bit harder compared to the other one,

07:59.640 --> 08:02.400
but we're still generally up compared to prior

08:02.400 --> 08:04.880
to the third pandemic in terms of questions and answers.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.360
And actually it's a pretty good sign

08:06.360 --> 08:08.200
that there's a lot of activity there.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.240
And I also wanted to just took a look to see

08:13.240 --> 08:16.360
as a percentage of all the questions on Stack Overflow,

08:16.360 --> 08:19.040
what percentage of them had at least something

08:19.040 --> 08:22.600
that mentioned WebRTC or one of these terms.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.680
And very surprising actually, it's actually very high.

08:27.080 --> 08:32.080
So it's something like one in,

08:32.080 --> 08:35.560
during the pandemic, it was one out of every 1400 questions

08:35.560 --> 08:38.240
on Stack Overflow had something that mentioned WebRTC,

08:38.240 --> 08:39.760
which that seems like quite a bit

08:39.760 --> 08:42.400
because I still consider WebRTC kind of a very

08:42.400 --> 08:43.480
niche sort of thing.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.920
And even if you look today, just in this,

08:46.920 --> 08:49.640
well, the last data point in this one is November,

08:49.640 --> 08:52.160
at that point it was still one in, I'm sorry,

08:52.160 --> 08:57.160
it was one in 900 during the peak of April of 2020.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.280
It's still one in 1400 today,

09:00.280 --> 09:01.840
which is it was still actually very high.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.360
So you can see, you can interpret this two ways.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.320
One, WebRTC is very confusing

09:06.320 --> 09:07.720
and people have a lot of questions.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.680
So they need to comment on it.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.200
Or you can also see there's a lot of people involved.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.040
Like I, both are good, right?

09:15.440 --> 09:16.280
But yeah.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.920
So also very interested, can we look at this dataset

09:21.920 --> 09:24.800
to understand development trends, what's going on

09:25.880 --> 09:26.720
in the market?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.200
And one of the very interesting things

09:28.200 --> 09:29.600
I always like to look at is what are some

09:29.600 --> 09:32.520
of the language trends, programming languages

09:32.520 --> 09:33.720
that people are using.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.720
And this is a jumble and hard to see.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.280
So let's actually zoom in.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.200
So one of the ones I've been trying to track for a while

09:41.200 --> 09:43.360
is JavaScript versus TypeScript.

09:43.360 --> 09:48.360
I've been delaying converting to TypeScript.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.760
And I'm kind of wondering, do I need to,

09:50.760 --> 09:52.640
is it time for me to really switch over?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.180
Can I wait a little bit longer?

09:54.180 --> 09:56.240
You can see here, well, obviously TypeScript

09:56.240 --> 09:57.760
has been getting more popular.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.840
We just, in December, reached the 50-50 point.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.680
Of all these repos, where TypeScript's half.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.760
So I think I'm probably behind and need to switch.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.840
So there's also, at this conference,

10:16.840 --> 10:19.600
a bunch of exciting new languages that are coming out.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.840
So I wanted to zoom in and kind of take a look

10:21.840 --> 10:24.120
to see what's going on with them.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.920
So Go, Kotlin, and Rust in particular.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.960
So I will say one of the challenges,

10:30.960 --> 10:32.420
I didn't get any chance to filter this out,

10:32.420 --> 10:37.420
but this Go jump from November to December is some bots.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.760
It's just bot activity.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.880
So you can, yeah.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.480
I thought originally maybe it's just Christmas

10:43.480 --> 10:45.440
and Go developers don't have anything better to do.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.640
So over the holidays, they're just programming a lot

10:48.640 --> 10:49.640
and starting a lot of new repos.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.060
That wasn't, it actually was some bugs.

10:52.060 --> 10:55.160
But you can see here, this steadily increasing.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.840
It's not a huge, huge spike for these other two,

10:58.840 --> 11:00.140
but it is going up.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.120
And as a new language that's getting popular,

11:03.120 --> 11:05.920
I guess you'd expect to, you're gonna see more of that.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.840
So in addition to languages, also there's a bunch

11:09.840 --> 11:13.680
of the new APIs, some that were referenced earlier today.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.880
So insertable streams is one such API,

11:17.880 --> 11:19.960
and that's actually two sub-APIs,

11:19.960 --> 11:22.800
MediaStream Track Processor and Track Generator.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.560
First took a look on Chrome status

11:25.560 --> 11:29.080
and actually credit to Phippo, Phil Panky

11:29.080 --> 11:32.180
for having a, he built a custom viewer

11:32.180 --> 11:33.820
of the Chrome status information.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.880
They can see here, so compare them both at the same time.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.940
You can see that these are actually peaking quite a bit

11:40.940 --> 11:42.120
towards the end of the year, going up quite a bit.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.920
So I was curious, like who can we see?

11:44.920 --> 11:46.800
Are open source repos actually using these

11:46.800 --> 11:48.600
or is it somebody else?

11:48.600 --> 11:53.520
And looking at it, there's a big spike here,

11:53.520 --> 11:57.240
but it doesn't look like much, so what's going on there?

11:57.240 --> 11:58.600
You zoom in a little bit more, and again,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.960
apologies, it's really small, but like that initial spike,

12:01.960 --> 12:05.240
a lot of that was just pure standards-related activity

12:06.720 --> 12:10.320
of the W3C repos and WebKit and others

12:10.320 --> 12:12.760
that are just basically adopting those APIs

12:12.760 --> 12:13.760
in the first place.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.220
So you see a big jump.

12:15.220 --> 12:17.200
After that, it's really kind of hit or miss.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.000
And I was, I mean, I love working with it

12:20.000 --> 12:22.880
in server streams, what's he do, a lot of fun stuff.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.160
It's hoping to see more, but it's kind of just spotty.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.520
So going back to the Chrome status, what does that mean?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.480
Well, at least people that are using it

12:30.480 --> 12:34.320
are probably someone like Google Meet,

12:34.320 --> 12:36.480
that sort of thing that don't have public repos, right?

12:36.480 --> 12:39.300
Or there's something else outside of the public

12:39.300 --> 12:41.780
GitHub data set that's driving that usage.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.720
So another one is WebCodecs.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.560
It's another one.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.720
This one doesn't have quite the same peak.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.920
It's a little bit, WebCodecs is not quite as far along,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.720
but they're still driving up.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.400
We're gonna see if there's something going on here too.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.880
And again, you see gradual increase, not a ton,

13:00.880 --> 13:02.040
except for this one spike.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.280
And this one spike, again, was largely related to

13:05.280 --> 13:09.480
the initial standards release of WebKit

13:09.480 --> 13:13.120
and W3C type repos and related once to deploy that.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.920
So we see some uptick, but nothing all that significant yet.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.500
And for the last section,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.360
I was also wondering, is WebRTC winning?

13:27.360 --> 13:29.480
Like we don't talk a whole lot about WebRTC

13:29.480 --> 13:31.000
having competition so much anymore,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.760
at least I haven't, but in the early days,

13:32.760 --> 13:34.800
it was always WebRTC versus SIP.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.080
And is it, should SIP, those SIP type developers,

13:37.080 --> 13:39.640
that ecosystem, should they shift over to WebRTC?

13:39.640 --> 13:40.720
And we haven't seen that a whole lot,

13:40.720 --> 13:43.960
but I think in reality, there still is competition.

13:43.960 --> 13:48.280
And certainly during the pandemic, well, it's Zoom, right?

13:48.280 --> 13:51.000
And I actually presented this a couple of years ago

13:51.000 --> 13:53.960
at Dan's conference, an interesting fact where,

13:53.960 --> 13:57.280
there was a month in time where Zoom was worth more

13:57.280 --> 13:59.640
than the seventh largest airlines put together,

13:59.640 --> 14:00.760
at least their market capitalization,

14:00.760 --> 14:02.560
which is still insane when you think about it, right?

14:02.560 --> 14:03.880
But that was a reality.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.520
So I did wanna check to see if that's still the case,

14:06.520 --> 14:09.460
and it's not, right?

14:09.460 --> 14:13.440
So yeah, Zoom is using that to the same data point

14:13.440 --> 14:16.240
and just extending it out a little bit further.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.760
Zoom's down the other 80% where they were

14:18.760 --> 14:21.000
back in February of 2020.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.560
The airlines though aren't actually doing

14:22.560 --> 14:23.400
all that much better, right?

14:23.400 --> 14:26.880
So relative, Zoom's not doing some bad relative

14:26.880 --> 14:29.320
to the airlines, at least those same seven.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.160
But anyway, Zoom, not quite what it was,

14:33.160 --> 14:37.240
but they still really are competition, right?

14:37.240 --> 14:39.240
And particularly because Zoom, as it is now,

14:39.240 --> 14:40.600
is released as Zoom SDK,

14:40.600 --> 14:42.200
and they have a web version of this SDK.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.440
So as a developer, you do have a choice,

14:46.440 --> 14:47.560
hey, I wanna go build

14:47.560 --> 14:49.600
a real-time communications application.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.360
You can choose to use the WebRTC

14:51.360 --> 14:52.760
and all the vendors in Econsistent,

14:52.760 --> 14:55.160
or you can go to choose Zoom for this.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.040
And I was curious, and Zoom's marketing us a lot.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.400
I'll probably have a post on WebRTC,

14:59.400 --> 15:02.900
a Hacks with Thippo, hopefully in a few weeks

15:02.900 --> 15:05.840
that Zoom's been promoting the benefits of this.

15:05.840 --> 15:10.160
And it's a, I'll go into why

15:10.160 --> 15:12.640
that's not completely true during the post,

15:12.640 --> 15:16.720
but I wanted to see our developers actually choosing Zoom

15:16.720 --> 15:20.720
over, or at least mentioning the Zoom SDK over WebRTC.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.360
It was gonna take me a while to dig into all this,

15:25.360 --> 15:28.080
the GitHub analysis, it wasn't clear.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.160
So I didn't include that part yet.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.000
But on Stack Overflow, it's pretty actually clear.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.880
There's a distinct Zoom SDK tag or label

15:35.880 --> 15:36.940
that they have there.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.920
And you can see here, actually, at least for now,

15:38.920 --> 15:42.640
WebRTC is still way more popular than the Zoom SDK.

15:44.220 --> 15:45.800
Two minutes, okay.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.140
And actually, I am done.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.920
So I guess what we would learn here,

15:50.920 --> 15:53.000
I mean, part of it is, what are your expectations here?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.080
I didn't necessarily go into any expectations

15:55.080 --> 15:56.660
other than I was interested to see

15:56.660 --> 15:58.400
what are some of the trends and can we find

15:58.400 --> 16:01.760
or learn things about new APIs or new repos.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.320
And I do go through the list actually,

16:03.320 --> 16:05.280
is interested in seeing new projects.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.640
Didn't have time to fit all that stuff in there,

16:06.640 --> 16:09.340
but again, you can reference some of the blog posts on this.

16:09.340 --> 16:10.800
But overall, my impression of WebRTC

16:10.800 --> 16:11.840
is still doing pretty well.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.520
Obviously, it's not pandemic well,

16:13.520 --> 16:16.340
but given the circumstances were better

16:16.340 --> 16:18.360
than it was before the pandemic,

16:18.360 --> 16:19.640
we have more developers involved.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.720
And it seems that developers that are involved,

16:21.720 --> 16:23.280
it is a lot of measures to say that

16:23.280 --> 16:24.120
that's actually more mature,

16:24.120 --> 16:25.020
they're better developers, right?

16:25.020 --> 16:27.480
They're contributing more than in the past.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.080
And I think that's a great thing.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.640
Thank you.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.480
Thank you.

16:31.480 --> 16:59.280
Thank you.
