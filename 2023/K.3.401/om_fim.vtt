WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.840
the

00:26.840 --> 00:29.360
if you already all I've found to this year.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.040
Yes.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.720
So we go on with our next speaker,

00:32.720 --> 00:37.280
Mikaeli, who is talk to us about the FBI improved image viewer.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.280
Please welcome Mikaeli.

00:41.280 --> 00:49.200
So welcome to my talk about using the film image viewer.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.960
Around 2006, I was a user of FBI,

00:52.960 --> 00:57.120
the image viewer for the Linux frame buffer.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.880
I was fond of it, but at some point I thought I really need to

01:01.880 --> 01:06.280
have the VIM arrow keys into FBI,

01:06.280 --> 01:08.760
and I made a patch to FBI.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.400
At some point, I started realizing that I need something more,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.920
like some shortcuts,

01:14.920 --> 01:18.760
bindings, or a small command line,

01:18.760 --> 01:22.160
commands, at some point a parser,

01:22.160 --> 01:23.400
autocompletion.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.480
So hack after hack,

01:25.480 --> 01:28.000
a fork came out of FBI,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.320
which I called film.

01:29.320 --> 01:33.520
So something which takes inspiration from the VIM text editor,

01:33.520 --> 01:37.080
the map, mail user,

01:37.080 --> 01:39.760
and well, sorry, mail user agent,

01:39.760 --> 01:41.840
and the shell languages.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.240
So what is nowadays film?

01:45.240 --> 01:48.520
It's a Unix tool, a Unix tool for one task.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.160
One task which is viewing images.

01:51.160 --> 01:55.600
It's not editing images, so many people confound this.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.840
It's for command line users,

01:57.840 --> 02:00.320
people who like using the keyboard.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.920
It has a configuration file,

02:02.920 --> 02:06.160
because it's nice to configure custom commands.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.160
It uses regular expressions, standard inputs, standard output,

02:11.160 --> 02:14.120
and it plays nice in scripts.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.440
So it's highly interoperable.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.840
The Amoto is like in parallel,

02:18.840 --> 02:23.200
like in parallel, there is more than one way to do it.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.160
I think film plays well with all the hardware.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.840
There are functionalities for caching files or

02:31.840 --> 02:36.880
image from files to load them in advance via prefetching,

02:36.880 --> 02:39.360
so to spare a bit of IO.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.920
The user interface is quite minimal,

02:41.920 --> 02:43.160
so there are no menus,

02:43.160 --> 02:45.640
no buttons, sorry, at the moment.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.400
It works at the moment with four outputs,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.760
graphical outputs styles.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.240
So pixels with X11,

02:54.240 --> 02:56.600
pixels with Linux frame buffer,

02:56.600 --> 02:59.600
and ASCII art with and without color.

02:59.600 --> 03:05.840
It plays a bit nice under SSH or screen in different situations.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.160
So on this picture here, you say a pixel mode,

03:10.680 --> 03:14.840
character mode, and other character modes without the colors.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.400
So you select this when you start the program,

03:17.400 --> 03:19.880
or you let it just being

03:19.880 --> 03:24.120
auto-detected by the environment variables.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.960
The basic invocation of film is more or

03:27.960 --> 03:31.480
less like what you expect from most programs.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.480
So you specify the files you want to open,

03:34.480 --> 03:37.920
and in the case of graphical files,

03:37.920 --> 03:41.200
the magic number will determine which decoder to use,

03:41.200 --> 03:42.320
not the file extension.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.480
However, if you want to open a directory,

03:44.480 --> 03:47.600
or recursively three of directories,

03:47.600 --> 03:51.080
or perhaps even with a background load function,

03:51.080 --> 03:55.400
then filtering on file names will occur.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.800
Again, it's quite intuitive what

03:59.800 --> 04:03.320
the plus minus page up, page down keys do.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.200
So it's what you expect, and this is good.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.520
What they do, usually, of course,

04:09.520 --> 04:12.240
the binding is dynamic,

04:12.240 --> 04:15.880
so you can configure film to do different things.

04:15.880 --> 04:22.040
The defaults are for plus to call the magnify command,

04:22.040 --> 04:24.040
the internal magnify command,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.520
for minus the reduce command,

04:26.520 --> 04:28.680
or apart from commands,

04:28.680 --> 04:32.520
you have also small actions which can be longer,

04:32.520 --> 04:35.000
can be like a concatenation of,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.880
let's say, command argument,

04:36.880 --> 04:43.280
or even a small control flow expression.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.480
So it's quite rich,

04:46.480 --> 04:50.680
what you can assign to single keys.

04:50.680 --> 04:54.320
So in general, this language which I show here in

04:54.320 --> 04:59.080
this red boxes, it lives in the command line.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.800
The command line which hosts this language,

05:01.800 --> 05:04.400
which you can also access with the column key,

05:04.400 --> 05:07.360
just like in VIM, and just like in VIM and other

05:07.360 --> 05:09.840
other softwares with the tab,

05:09.840 --> 05:13.360
you might get some auto-completion of, I don't know,

05:13.360 --> 05:15.840
commands, variable names.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.720
It's not science fiction,

05:17.720 --> 05:21.360
so it can be helpful.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.120
Yeah, and this is the same language that you also use in

05:24.120 --> 05:26.040
the configuration files and scripts.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.360
So that is the film language.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.920
The language elements of film are commands,

05:31.920 --> 05:34.840
alliances, which you can customize,

05:34.840 --> 05:38.360
variables built-in or customizable,

05:38.360 --> 05:41.680
if-while blocks, so to have a bit of control,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.760
and some special syntax like

05:43.760 --> 05:47.800
shortcut expressions or shortcut statements

05:47.800 --> 05:51.200
for some other precise things.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.760
How do I use film?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.520
I don't spend much time programming it,

05:54.520 --> 05:56.800
or programming the usage of film.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.400
Most of the time, I use it

05:58.400 --> 06:01.320
interactively as any other image viewer.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.800
Especially to organize pictures collections,

06:03.800 --> 06:04.880
like I will show later.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.240
Occasionally, I use the special functionality.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.480
So what is really unique to film or the command line,

06:11.480 --> 06:13.400
it's quite rarely when I come up with

06:13.400 --> 06:15.360
some nice workflow which I like.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.880
Yes, then I exchange the configuration file,

06:17.880 --> 06:21.520
or even made, I do an alias in the shell

06:21.520 --> 06:25.320
to reuse some special way of calling film,

06:25.320 --> 06:28.360
which is for me, which is customized for me.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.240
So now we will continue with this talk.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.120
I just wanted to mention that another talk,

06:33.120 --> 06:35.440
which has been recorded,

06:35.440 --> 06:37.840
will go into language-specific topics.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.040
That is a bit more nerdy than this.

06:40.040 --> 06:45.240
This talk here goes about the interactive usage of film.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.600
This is not really a tutorial,

06:47.600 --> 06:48.920
it's not really the documentation,

06:48.920 --> 06:50.360
it's a bit of a showcase,

06:50.360 --> 06:51.880
what I will be showing here.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.240
So I said, film is programmable,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.080
but you don't want to program it here at

06:57.080 --> 06:59.160
this in what I'm showing you here,

06:59.160 --> 07:01.520
but still you want to use a bit of automation.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.080
The base level of automation is

07:04.080 --> 07:06.760
perhaps to simulate a key press.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.520
So when you invoke film and specify minus K,

07:10.520 --> 07:14.560
the name of a character or of a key press, that will happen.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.520
So as you press that key.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.760
So for R, we'll rotate.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.360
I mean, this is what will happen just after startup.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.920
Afterwards, you are in control.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.560
So with R, we'd rotate,

07:27.560 --> 07:31.240
with delete, we'll delete the first image from the list,

07:31.240 --> 07:33.120
with CH, control H,

07:33.120 --> 07:38.280
we'll make help pop up and so on.

07:38.280 --> 07:42.600
You can go further with minus upper case K,

07:42.600 --> 07:45.360
so with key combos.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.720
So if you specify minus big K,

07:47.720 --> 07:50.320
RA, rotate, and auto-scale,

07:50.320 --> 07:53.720
that will happen as the first thing with film starts once.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.160
So afterwards, you're in control.

07:56.160 --> 08:02.960
In VIM, I appreciate that when you're about to press a key,

08:02.960 --> 08:06.120
and you prepend it with a digit or more digits,

08:06.120 --> 08:08.480
the number that you will have specified,

08:08.480 --> 08:13.200
will specify also the repetition of what is about to be done.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.960
So you have this also here.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.200
Of course, now I'm showing you here the command line,

08:17.200 --> 08:18.800
but this is the interactive usage.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.560
So should we do it interactively, this is what happens.

08:21.560 --> 08:26.000
It's the same interpreter who processes this.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.440
But there's also the dot modifier in VIM,

08:30.440 --> 08:35.920
and also here, that instead of repeating twice a particular command,

08:35.920 --> 08:41.400
you can add a dot after what you have just done,

08:41.400 --> 08:43.520
and it will just repeat the last action.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.160
So plus dot, it's like plus plus.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.560
Now, you can combine this with the number syntax.

08:50.560 --> 08:58.080
So if you prepend a number to the dot,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.560
the dot will repeat the last command,

09:00.560 --> 09:02.480
that number, that amount of times.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.880
So this can spare you a bit of typing interactively,

09:05.880 --> 09:10.120
but also in this special mode here.

09:10.120 --> 09:13.160
Of course, this just applies to the last command,

09:13.160 --> 09:16.560
not to the last combo or last series of things.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.200
For more complicated things,

09:20.200 --> 09:22.520
you can use another mechanism,

09:22.520 --> 09:28.000
which is that of simply configuring your VIMrc file,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.120
and there you perhaps bind

09:31.120 --> 09:35.400
a particular keyboard key to a special command.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.960
Then yes, you can use a repetition on that combo which you like,

09:40.960 --> 09:43.680
which is what is useful to you,

09:43.680 --> 09:47.400
and that's the way to go.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.600
So not over-complicate unnecessary things.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.480
Now, I will show random functionality which I like in VIM,

09:54.480 --> 09:57.960
or I didn't bother looking in other image viewers.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.320
So with the double apostrophe,

10:00.320 --> 10:05.640
I have the so-called shadow directory load, let's say.

10:05.640 --> 10:09.560
So my observation is that nowadays,

10:09.560 --> 10:11.640
cameras have a very high resolution.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.320
I don't need that resolution.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.760
Mostly, the pictures which come from

10:14.760 --> 10:17.600
those cameras are too heavy for my purposes.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.720
So what I do is that I have a directory with reductions,

10:21.720 --> 10:23.520
which fit more or less my screen,

10:23.520 --> 10:25.200
and I have another directory with

10:25.200 --> 10:27.760
the heavy image original pictures.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.720
But with VIM, I just say,

10:29.720 --> 10:33.200
hey VIM, in that directory are the originals,

10:33.200 --> 10:35.800
the heavy originals. So be aware of this.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.720
Then VIM offers me the double apostrophe,

10:39.720 --> 10:41.640
the double quote key,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.520
which does something which I forgot what it is,

10:43.520 --> 10:45.800
but you can just check it up with the help.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.440
That will substitute the content of the images,

10:49.440 --> 10:54.000
of the current images with image with a high resolution,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.120
or low resolution, or whatever you have set it up.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.400
So it's a way to substitute it.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.680
Probably, you can use it to create funny games or whatever,

11:01.680 --> 11:05.200
but for me, it's just the purpose of substituting

11:05.760 --> 11:09.720
the low resolution image with the high resolution image.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.760
Because I like using used computers.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.840
I think there's too much garbage on this earth,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.840
and therefore, sometimes I don't need

11:15.840 --> 11:19.840
that extra heavy processing in my everyday usage.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.640
I think this can help many users.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.440
Another thing which is perhaps unique maybe,

11:26.440 --> 11:29.680
it's a simple key to jump

11:29.680 --> 11:32.880
between the last view and the current view.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.720
Why? Because sometimes I watched 100 pictures,

11:36.720 --> 11:39.840
I do a selection of the few pictures I really like,

11:39.840 --> 11:42.200
and I jump between them because I want to see

11:42.200 --> 11:45.240
certain detail from one side, from the other side.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.960
So I like to jump a lot of times between two pictures,

11:47.960 --> 11:50.080
perhaps to catch some detail,

11:50.080 --> 11:54.440
and therefore, I have this key which most of the times,

11:54.440 --> 11:59.400
I would say retains the position you were and the scaling.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.120
So it's really for comparing things.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.320
I find it useful, especially in combination,

12:03.320 --> 12:05.760
as I said, with the short listing functionality

12:05.760 --> 12:09.320
which allows you to make selections.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.080
To shorten the selection of pictures.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.480
Now, another random functionality

12:14.480 --> 12:16.200
is the one of conversion pipelines.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.360
Sometimes you want to load things which are not

12:19.360 --> 12:24.800
properly pixel images like SVG files or PDFs or post-clip files.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.440
There are a few built-in defaults in

12:28.440 --> 12:32.040
theme which will invoke that external program

12:32.040 --> 12:35.400
to convert it in something that theme can view.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.200
So this enlarges the set of

12:38.200 --> 12:41.200
the picture formats which you can watch under theme.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.000
Extending this idea, perhaps sometimes you want to view

12:45.000 --> 12:47.400
all of the images which you are about to load

12:47.400 --> 12:50.080
with one specific filter pipeline.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.920
Here I have shown convert with charcoal filter and

12:53.920 --> 12:58.040
put a label on the bottom.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.840
Yeah, you can specify that to theme when you start it,

13:00.840 --> 13:02.840
and all of the pictures which you will see in

13:02.840 --> 13:06.800
that session will be filtered according that way.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.840
I don't know what this is useful for.

13:08.840 --> 13:13.000
Previews, making fun, you choose it.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.960
But the point is, if you don't screw up this expression,

13:16.960 --> 13:18.800
you will not write to any file,

13:18.800 --> 13:22.720
so just temporary files will be modified.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.160
You can interact with different programs in different situations.

13:26.160 --> 13:31.720
Sometimes you can use the exclamation point syntax to call

13:31.720 --> 13:33.640
an external program and then we

13:33.640 --> 13:36.120
have external program that gets its output.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.640
Okay, it's not that useful.

13:37.640 --> 13:42.400
But still, if you go the dangerous way,

13:42.400 --> 13:45.720
you are not afraid, you create an alias which maybe

13:45.720 --> 13:49.640
calls in the end ExifTool and you say ExifTool,

13:49.640 --> 13:54.600
please remove the ExifData from the file which I'm just watching,

13:54.600 --> 14:00.160
because you can specify that file as an internal variable.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.320
Yes, you will modify the current file, which is dangerous.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.480
You should not do it, but if you really want and you are

14:05.480 --> 14:08.800
automating some nice useful workflow, you can do it.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.200
I have warned you. Okay.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.600
Did you know that with film,

14:12.600 --> 14:16.640
you can even load files from a file name list?

14:16.640 --> 14:18.840
Okay, this sounds boring.

14:18.840 --> 14:23.200
Sounds boring, but maybe it's nicer if you learn that with film,

14:23.200 --> 14:27.160
you can write files with the file name and the description.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.000
Okay, maybe it could be even useful in a few situations.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.040
In my case, I find it useful or I like it

14:33.040 --> 14:36.960
because film has a few captions in

14:36.960 --> 14:40.840
different parts of the displayed window, let's say.

14:40.840 --> 14:46.160
There are a few variables with expando codes,

14:46.160 --> 14:48.640
so like percentage and something.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.200
So you can customize them.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.600
You can view, I don't know,

14:51.600 --> 14:55.400
the comment which are the description which I said before,

14:55.400 --> 14:56.520
or other information.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.840
So you can customize it a bit the way you want it.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.400
More, you can have in this description file,

15:04.400 --> 15:07.720
internal variables. So just for the purpose of giving

15:07.720 --> 15:12.000
attributes to the files you're about to have in the list.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.280
So not only the descriptions, but also attributes.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.720
So the bill will be in the category businessman.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.200
Arun as best, the Brahmin Richard will be in the category activist.

15:21.200 --> 15:29.400
So they will inherit this, those attributes.

15:29.400 --> 15:33.760
Furthermore, there are some shortcut syntaxes

15:33.760 --> 15:37.720
which prepend text to this description,

15:37.720 --> 15:42.160
or allow referring to specific variables in

15:42.160 --> 15:46.320
those descriptions for the purpose of making them shorter.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.960
What you can use it for apart from the caption.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.160
Well, you can use them also for searching

15:51.160 --> 15:54.280
the picture in the file list.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.520
So with the go to command,

15:57.520 --> 16:02.520
or you use a special slash or question mark syntax,

16:02.520 --> 16:05.560
not command line, but search line,

16:05.560 --> 16:09.840
to search and to jump directly to a file which has a description that way.

16:09.840 --> 16:15.040
So if you manage your picture's collection nicely, it can be useful.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.000
For me, it's nice because I have my picture

16:17.000 --> 16:19.720
targeted that way and I'm happy with that.

16:19.720 --> 16:24.800
Or I have custom collections of pictures that way for my own amusement.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.280
Yes. So you have this go to command,

16:28.280 --> 16:33.600
which you can use also in other ways like jumping or controlling it to jump

16:33.600 --> 16:41.840
according to the values of those property variables.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.320
Or you can use this go to jump between to the next directory for instance.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.720
If you load like 1,000 files in different directories where they are,

16:50.720 --> 16:53.600
you can use go to and something very specific,

16:53.600 --> 16:55.240
which you find in the manual,

16:55.240 --> 17:00.200
and this will jump to the next directory inside what is being loaded there.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.200
So there are many shortcuts, let's say,

17:02.200 --> 17:06.360
for doing very specific jumps according to your workflow,

17:06.360 --> 17:09.800
because this is to adapt the way you wish to organize your stuff.

17:09.800 --> 17:13.080
Of course, if you have different specifications to the go to command,

17:13.080 --> 17:17.400
the first one which matches the jump will do the jump.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.320
Before the session is over,

17:20.320 --> 17:22.800
I wish to say the limit functionality,

17:22.800 --> 17:24.840
which I took from Matt.

17:24.840 --> 17:29.240
I find it also useful because you can shrink the collection.

17:29.240 --> 17:33.640
For instance, I have around 20,000 pictures in my photograph collections,

17:33.640 --> 17:37.360
but I can limit them for instance to city equal Brussels

17:37.360 --> 17:40.200
or something like this which is useful to me.

17:40.200 --> 17:45.800
In this case, you see that we have shortened the pictures list from the five,

17:45.800 --> 17:47.840
total five to four,

17:47.840 --> 17:50.680
which matches category equal activist.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.600
Yeah, further, the limit command can do shrink the list

17:54.600 --> 17:59.320
according to duplicate the base file names or the date of the files

17:59.320 --> 18:02.200
or the size of the files.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.360
The base idea of film is that you use it interactively.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.200
You have a few alliances which you perhaps sometimes customize

18:10.200 --> 18:15.040
and assign to specific keys which you like to have.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.880
Yeah, and you write this in the configuration file

18:17.880 --> 18:19.720
and you perhaps share it with others.

18:19.720 --> 18:25.320
You just remember by heart the commands which you use every day.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.000
That's all. So, film at the moment,

18:28.000 --> 18:31.080
I will be releasing the 06 after 15 years,

18:31.080 --> 18:34.120
the 06 version in a few days.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.320
The tarball is out there.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.560
I have to do some promotion and especially I have to say,

18:40.560 --> 18:43.080
give the next version to the Debian guys.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.040
So, there is the version on Debian and everywhere else is old,

18:46.040 --> 18:48.680
but we'll update it soon.

18:48.680 --> 18:52.120
The manual has everything, so everything is written there.

18:52.120 --> 18:55.680
And I hope you enjoy film and perhaps watch the other recording

18:55.680 --> 18:58.440
with more nerdy language aspects.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.040
That's all. Thank you for your attention.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.800
Hello, Ernie.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.600
So, we have some time for questions.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.120
Is there any questions on the floor?

19:13.120 --> 19:17.560
Yeah, so, the collection stuff sounds particularly interesting.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.960
Can you update the collection from film itself?

19:19.960 --> 19:23.080
So, while you're watching it, you'll tag an image so that

19:23.080 --> 19:26.000
while you're watching images, you will update your collection

19:26.000 --> 19:28.200
from within film somehow?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.840
Perhaps. At the moment, I don't have this.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.440
You've write a text file in your...

19:31.440 --> 19:33.000
I'll take a question because they don't hear.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.920
The question was whether film, as I have written,

19:35.920 --> 19:37.760
organised a picture, organised a...

19:37.760 --> 19:39.480
I wrote it correctly. No, I wrote a...

19:39.480 --> 19:41.760
It was a mistake. Film is not an organised.

19:41.760 --> 19:46.040
You have to organise the files by yourself with a text editor.

19:46.040 --> 19:50.040
We have a non-line question here, if you can read it.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.320
Thank you for the talk.

19:51.320 --> 19:54.080
Is there a way, plan, to have a way for film to script

19:54.080 --> 19:57.120
a small step-by-step animation of the actions?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.200
Maybe some sort of slip between the actions.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.040
Yes, there is a functionality which is called...

20:03.040 --> 20:05.080
recording out or something like this.

20:05.080 --> 20:09.560
So, after you exit film on the stand-aloud,

20:09.560 --> 20:12.640
in a specific file,

20:12.640 --> 20:14.400
actions and commands...

20:14.400 --> 20:16.520
Sorry, and timings will be speeded out.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.840
So, there is a slip command which says slip, I don't know,

20:20.840 --> 20:23.200
three quarters of a second, something like this.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.720
Yes, there are three... Yes.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.320
Question on the floor?

20:27.320 --> 20:29.480
Yeah, good question.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.320
What about the descriptions?

20:31.320 --> 20:33.800
Are stored in the same image file?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.560
Are they stored like metadata in the files?

20:36.560 --> 20:39.640
Can they be read by exit tools?

20:39.640 --> 20:42.480
What I have shown here was just the plain things

20:42.480 --> 20:44.600
you write in a textual file.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.920
So, yeah, it takes the...

20:45.920 --> 20:49.640
Apart from this, the exit tags from JPEGs,

20:49.640 --> 20:51.800
or I don't know, I think in other places also you have

20:51.800 --> 20:54.400
exit data, but at least for JPEGs, are being read

20:54.400 --> 20:58.360
and they become internal variables in set film

20:58.360 --> 21:01.480
because I really like to have some particular JPEG

21:01.480 --> 21:03.360
exit data being displayed in the caption

21:03.360 --> 21:04.640
and that occurs there.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.800
Actually, also PNGs and also JPEGs

21:06.800 --> 21:08.560
without exit have commands.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.560
This also drift here.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.200
Yeah, so there are different...

21:12.200 --> 21:14.440
I don't think I'm covering everything, everything, everything,

21:14.440 --> 21:18.520
but as soon as I learn of some extra metadata,

21:18.520 --> 21:23.000
I integrate it into internal variables

21:23.000 --> 21:25.160
associated to each file.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.520
I have one extra slide.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.840
Any other question maybe?

21:29.840 --> 21:33.240
Maybe I didn't have an understanding so much.

21:33.240 --> 21:39.800
The result of modifying this file is...

21:39.800 --> 21:40.960
Modifying which file?

21:40.960 --> 21:43.720
The original file.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.160
Is there still another file?

21:46.160 --> 21:48.200
We don't modify any file with film.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.520
If you do it, it's a mistake.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.040
Ah, OK.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.400
There was one example where I was saying

21:55.400 --> 21:59.400
you can write programs to modify the file,

21:59.400 --> 22:01.600
but most of the times you don't want this.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.920
But if you really want it, you can.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.320
If the file is changed on disk, will film reload it

22:08.320 --> 22:09.800
automatically or will it...

22:09.800 --> 22:11.720
I think there is such a functionality.

22:11.720 --> 22:17.040
Maybe the question is, if you are stuck on a picture

22:17.040 --> 22:20.600
and the picture changes, will the film reload it?

22:24.160 --> 22:25.920
There is some functionality to detect this.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.080
I'm not sure if at the moment it's at default.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.120
In principle, it's like two lines of code.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.760
It's easy to implement this.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.840
I think this is for picture frame situations

22:35.840 --> 22:38.120
where many people use film for picture frames.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.160
I'm not happy with that.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.120
I wish people to use it interactively.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.760
But yes, that's possible.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.080
If you want, I have one extra slide.

22:47.080 --> 22:51.240
So with film, you can even play the little

22:51.240 --> 22:54.480
steganographer or the little forensic investigator

22:54.480 --> 23:00.840
by using the offset switch or the seek magic

23:00.840 --> 23:04.160
internal variable, which do nothing else and saying,

23:04.160 --> 23:08.680
hey, please, don't seek for the image at byte zero.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.560
Between here and here, the picture is there in the file.

23:12.560 --> 23:16.360
So you can use this for looking for the signatures

23:16.360 --> 23:19.240
within the file, which maybe is broken.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.960
Maybe there are a few files which we

23:20.960 --> 23:22.440
concatenate for some reasons.

23:22.440 --> 23:26.080
Maybe it's a tar archive, which actually...

23:26.080 --> 23:26.800
Sorry?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.960
I have an example of this.

23:28.960 --> 23:35.640
So if you look at your Chrome cache, Chrome browser cache,

23:35.640 --> 23:40.080
you have binary files which are a concatenation of HTTP

23:40.080 --> 23:42.680
headers and image file.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.520
And right now, I'm using X-T2 to find the byte offset

23:45.520 --> 23:49.240
and then using image file.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.600
I would try it being the...

23:51.600 --> 23:53.000
Yeah, so film is...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.360
It's the same thing.

23:55.360 --> 24:01.480
So the question is, the observation is actually,

24:01.480 --> 24:06.480
apart from maybe seeking into broken file systems that way,

24:06.480 --> 24:09.640
you can even just look into the certain configuration files,

24:09.640 --> 24:12.680
so certain cache files, like the one from the Chrome browser,

24:12.680 --> 24:15.720
because there actually, there are some special custom file

24:15.720 --> 24:21.320
formats where a proper file is pushed down into another file.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.080
Yeah, the image has an HTTP response

24:23.080 --> 24:24.720
address in the same file.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.400
Yeah, there are encodings, let's say, which simply,

24:28.400 --> 24:30.560
you have a picture, but it's not immediately,

24:30.560 --> 24:32.120
cannot be immediately seen.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.320
But with this, you can, with functionality which jumps or

24:35.320 --> 24:41.600
seeks, looks for a file, perhaps with a signature can locate it.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
Yeah.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.160
Okay, the last question.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.800
We don't have any online.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.720
Question on the floor, yeah?

24:48.720 --> 24:49.800
On the left?

24:49.800 --> 24:52.080
No? Okay.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.600
Okay, thank you, Mikaelle.

24:53.600 --> 25:00.600
Thank you.
