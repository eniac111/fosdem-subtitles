1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.280
All right, thank you for coming. So I'm Pierre and I'm going to talk to you about Kazarman,

2
0:00:10.280 --> 0:00:19.360
how we tried bridging activity purpose metrics. So we talked about a lot about interoperability

3
0:00:19.360 --> 0:00:26.360
even two years ago. We found it sad that we talked about interoperability for proprietary

4
0:00:26.360 --> 0:00:36.480
platforms not with our alternative decentralized networks. So we tried doing that. Kazarman

5
0:00:36.480 --> 0:00:47.120
is hosted on GitLab. It's using the license Edge GPLv3 and it's done in Elixir. So we've

6
0:00:47.120 --> 0:00:52.840
shown that there was some stuff that hinted at building it. There was some article on

7
0:00:52.840 --> 0:01:00.440
the metrics guide saying that you could bridge two decentralized networks. And there also

8
0:01:00.440 --> 0:01:07.760
was a hackernews comment by Matthew saying that there could be an activity pub bridge.

9
0:01:07.760 --> 0:01:16.320
And there also was a metrics client library made by UHooray that we wanted to use and

10
0:01:16.320 --> 0:01:24.000
also an activity pub client library that was extracted from Playroom R and made by the

11
0:01:24.000 --> 0:01:33.760
MoodleNet people and then by people at Bonfire. So the idea is to bridge those networks by

12
0:01:33.760 --> 0:01:43.520
creating puppet users. So Kazarman is both an activity metrics server. It is an application

13
0:01:43.520 --> 0:01:50.720
service like other bridges and it's also an activity pub server. So we on the activity

14
0:01:50.720 --> 0:01:58.400
pub side we create puppet actors and they can talk to activity pub users. On the metrics

15
0:01:58.400 --> 0:02:05.920
side we create metrics puppet users that can talk to other metrics users. So we wanted

16
0:02:05.920 --> 0:02:13.880
to both build an application service that you can deploy alongside your home server

17
0:02:13.880 --> 0:02:24.040
and also to have a public bridge so that other people on the federated metrics network can

18
0:02:24.040 --> 0:02:29.160
talk to activity pub users even if they don't have Kazarman installed on their server. So

19
0:02:29.160 --> 0:02:35.880
that's what I'm showing here. And we as I said you can also be installed on your home server

20
0:02:35.880 --> 0:02:42.080
and then you have nicely displayed user names for instance just you know one characters

21
0:02:42.080 --> 0:02:52.880
that changed. We made the web front end to help people see the bridged addresses. We

22
0:02:52.880 --> 0:03:02.280
also show here that we can display rooms that we'll talk about later. We started by bridging

23
0:03:02.280 --> 0:03:07.640
the chat that had been implemented by play Roma. It's only a one to one conversation

24
0:03:07.640 --> 0:03:19.560
chat so we use the direct rooms of metrics to do that. We then try to bridge direct messages

25
0:03:19.560 --> 0:03:24.960
like on Mastodon. Those are posts that are only sent to people that are mentioned in

26
0:03:24.960 --> 0:03:35.480
it. So there we used private rooms in metrics. So there are no end to end encryption in

27
0:03:35.480 --> 0:03:44.160
activity pub. So for now Kazarman only works on unencrypted rooms. It could work on encrypted

28
0:03:44.160 --> 0:03:54.120
rooms but then it would just bridge by the encrypted messages. And then we also wanted

29
0:03:54.120 --> 0:04:03.760
to bridge activity pub public activities by creating public rooms where public activities

30
0:04:03.760 --> 0:04:13.040
are just bridged. It was something that wasn't really well sold out because we thought that

31
0:04:13.040 --> 0:04:18.640
it was a good idea to start bridging public activities as soon as activity pub users are

32
0:04:18.640 --> 0:04:25.440
searched for. And so we made a relay actor that started following people quite immediately.

33
0:04:25.440 --> 0:04:32.640
It turned out that the activity pub Fediverse had bad experiences with follow butts as they

34
0:04:32.640 --> 0:04:40.000
say because there were people trying to index the Fediverse. So there were angry people

35
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:49.040
that started defecrating our staging instance. But there were also nice people who came in

36
0:04:49.040 --> 0:04:53.560
our metrics room and we thought about ways to make it opt-in. For instance by having

37
0:04:53.560 --> 0:05:00.480
the relay bot send a direct message and wait for a positive answer or by having it wait

38
0:05:00.480 --> 0:05:07.520
to be followed to then follow back. Here are an example with a peer-to-peer video where

39
0:05:07.520 --> 0:05:16.840
we can use a reply to have people post comments on the video. We also did something pretty

40
0:05:16.840 --> 0:05:25.240
nice with Mobilizon where you have groups and then we found that we could have people

41
0:05:25.240 --> 0:05:30.640
invite metrics users and it would create a private room and as soon as people joined

42
0:05:30.640 --> 0:05:36.080
the room then there would be members of the group and then you could use the same activity

43
0:05:36.080 --> 0:05:45.760
types for discussions that happen in Mobilizon groups. So as a summary we bridged the user

44
0:05:45.760 --> 0:05:55.280
search, the profile, we bridged multiple activity types, post chat message, video and events.

45
0:05:55.280 --> 0:06:04.920
Activity pub rooms are still to be finished. We also started to build metrics user rooms

46
0:06:04.920 --> 0:06:11.280
so people could ask the relay bot to make a room that their administrator offers as

47
0:06:11.280 --> 0:06:17.640
an ad-book room and then it would publish what they say as a public activity pub activity

48
0:06:17.640 --> 0:06:25.040
so they could be followed and appear on the Fediverse. There's also something to be

49
0:06:25.040 --> 0:06:35.680
thought again about that because on ActivityPub you need to have a way to see the activities

50
0:06:35.680 --> 0:06:42.640
that are sent from the instance when they were sent. So we made a webpage for the activities

51
0:06:42.640 --> 0:06:49.160
that are sent but then there's a thing of also showing replies like that and it's not

52
0:06:49.160 --> 0:06:54.560
something that's really nice to also display activities from other instances so we need

53
0:06:54.560 --> 0:07:00.240
to think about it again. As I said the Mobilizon groups, the private

54
0:07:00.240 --> 0:07:05.600
room has direct messages and the direct room has pre-homes at chat. We have replies, attachments

55
0:07:05.600 --> 0:07:14.440
and mentions. So there is still quite some things to be done but you are welcome to come

56
0:07:14.440 --> 0:07:21.200
and provide feedback or maybe contribute if you would like. I've also shown as it's a

57
0:07:21.200 --> 0:07:27.200
developer room some parts of the application service library that we made in Elixir. So

58
0:07:27.200 --> 0:07:32.400
we just need some configuration like the one on the application service configuration file

59
0:07:32.400 --> 0:07:38.360
and then you can use a nice feature in Elixir like pattern matching to just select the messages

60
0:07:38.360 --> 0:07:49.360
that you want to act on. Here's an example. So just to finish I'd like to thank NGI0 and

61
0:07:49.360 --> 0:07:56.520
Net that funded us and we are in the process of having yellow to sponsor some servers for

62
0:07:56.520 --> 0:08:02.800
our public instance and we've got hints on security by radically open security and then

63
0:08:02.800 --> 0:08:11.240
accessibility by accessibility.nl. We've also started to create an organization to work

64
0:08:11.240 --> 0:08:18.120
on Kazama on other projects that are mostly built on metrics so feel free to come follow

65
0:08:18.120 --> 0:08:36.320
us and maybe support us and I think that's it. Thank you. Are there any questions? Are

66
0:08:36.320 --> 0:08:49.600
there any comments? I'm not so much into social media such as

67
0:08:49.600 --> 0:08:56.400
a video verse but I got the attention that there's much more public conversation going

68
0:08:56.400 --> 0:09:06.680
on than is useful on instant messaging. So if I got a somewhat closed room type in matrix

69
0:09:06.680 --> 0:09:15.600
and there's an interaction here at Bridge to field Kazama, would it mean that the whole

70
0:09:15.600 --> 0:09:25.080
conversation can become a public conversation on a favor side? No it wouldn't. If there are

71
0:09:25.080 --> 0:09:29.880
something that are bridged as public it's only because it's on public rooms and the

72
0:09:29.880 --> 0:09:37.480
other way around too. So if we use private rooms it's only for private messages. It's

73
0:09:37.480 --> 0:09:56.080
the same type of... Yeah absolutely. Thank you. You didn't mention the delete event of

74
0:09:56.080 --> 0:10:08.360
course. I forgot to mention it but we already support the delete event so deletions are bridged

75
0:10:08.360 --> 0:10:16.480
on both sides of networks. Could you talk about the choice of the

76
0:10:16.480 --> 0:10:26.760
next field? Did you think it was a language for this application or just a different language?

77
0:10:26.760 --> 0:10:30.560
It's a language that I love but it's also with the framework Phoenix. It's also a great

78
0:10:30.560 --> 0:10:36.520
language to build HTTP APIs and that's something that we do on both sides of the bridge. So

79
0:10:36.520 --> 0:10:45.040
it worked out pretty well in the end. Another question. Is it already in such a state that

80
0:10:45.040 --> 0:10:52.800
we can just, as you proposed, install it next to our home server and it will just run or

81
0:10:52.800 --> 0:11:03.000
is it still some rough edges? I think it's not yet ready but it's really close. I'd really

82
0:11:03.000 --> 0:11:08.000
love to start by deploying the public bridge so that people can start using it and provide

83
0:11:08.000 --> 0:11:14.200
feedback as a public beta first. So I think it's not yet ready to be deployed on your

84
0:11:14.200 --> 0:11:19.200
own server. Plus the fact that we started to work on the features of the public bridge

85
0:11:19.200 --> 0:11:23.040
means that there are still something that could be bridged that are not supposed to

86
0:11:23.040 --> 0:11:32.560
be bridged on a private bridge. So what's the prospect on end-to-end encryption?

87
0:11:32.560 --> 0:11:38.160
It's very cool that it supports unencrypted stuff but I'm a bit curious on the activity

88
0:11:38.160 --> 0:11:47.160
pop side. Is there anything happening there? I don't really much know. I know that people

89
0:11:47.160 --> 0:11:52.160
have been talking about but I'm not sure what the state of it actually is right now.

90
0:11:52.160 --> 0:12:09.160
Yes. So in terms of bridging, is it being encrypted and non-encrypted in the chance?

91
0:12:09.160 --> 0:12:17.160
Because we said that if you have a private encrypted chat in matrix, it will bridge that

92
0:12:17.160 --> 0:12:24.160
database or whatever you can still read. Yes, absolutely. That's something that I think

93
0:12:24.160 --> 0:12:30.840
is a choice to make. I think that it's also, there are some features that are added if

94
0:12:30.840 --> 0:12:35.800
we add support for unencrypted rooms because it still gets unencrypted on the home servers

95
0:12:35.800 --> 0:12:42.560
and federated on server on matrix but it also could give a false sentiment of security.

96
0:12:42.560 --> 0:12:47.920
So that's something that we really don't know about and still needs to be decided.

97
0:12:47.920 --> 0:13:12.920
Okay. No question or comment? Thank you very much.
