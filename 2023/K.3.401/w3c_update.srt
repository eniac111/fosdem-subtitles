1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.200
We'll show you five.

2
0:00:08.200 --> 0:00:09.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
0:00:09.440 --> 0:00:12.400
And just shout if I'm running out of time.

4
0:00:12.400 --> 0:00:15.920
Well, everybody, thanks for coming out today.

5
0:00:15.920 --> 0:00:17.840
Where's the speaker?

6
0:00:17.840 --> 0:00:22.400
He's going to give us an update on W3C.

7
0:00:22.400 --> 0:00:24.400
I forgot to pick mine yesterday.

8
0:00:24.400 --> 0:00:32.600
Yeah, great.

9
0:00:32.600 --> 0:00:35.560
Hello, everyone.

10
0:00:35.560 --> 0:00:39.120
Hello, I'm going to start.

11
0:00:39.120 --> 0:00:40.760
So thank you for being here.

12
0:00:40.760 --> 0:00:44.240
I'm glad to open that dev room.

13
0:00:44.240 --> 0:00:49.520
It's my first time at Fuzz.dam, so I'm very happy to be here in front of you.

14
0:00:49.520 --> 0:00:53.800
And I ask you to be kind because I'm not used to present that much, right?

15
0:00:53.800 --> 0:00:57.120
And I'm open to feedback afterward.

16
0:00:57.120 --> 0:00:58.840
Just come and see me.

17
0:00:58.840 --> 0:00:59.760
Tell me how to improve.

18
0:00:59.760 --> 0:01:03.400
I would be very, very happy to hear you.

19
0:01:03.400 --> 0:01:06.880
Okay, my talk is about W3C.

20
0:01:06.880 --> 0:01:09.200
Do you know W3C?

21
0:01:09.200 --> 0:01:10.440
Who knows that?

22
0:01:10.440 --> 0:01:11.160
Raise your hand.

23
0:01:11.160 --> 0:01:14.640
Okay, that was an easy question for everybody to raise their hand, right?

24
0:01:14.640 --> 0:01:16.680
It's a worldwide organization.

25
0:01:16.680 --> 0:01:17.760
Everybody knows it.

26
0:01:17.760 --> 0:01:19.280
They define standards.

27
0:01:19.280 --> 0:01:21.600
And it's quite far from us, right?

28
0:01:21.600 --> 0:01:24.920
We don't know exactly what happened in that organization.

29
0:01:24.920 --> 0:01:30.600
There's big names and serious people around the table discussing things.

30
0:01:30.600 --> 0:01:34.960
And eventually, they agree on something that applies to the market.

31
0:01:36.360 --> 0:01:40.960
And they've got some working group, and there is one working group,

32
0:01:40.960 --> 0:01:43.920
which is about WebRTC.

33
0:01:43.920 --> 0:01:47.760
Okay, who works with WebRTC in the room?

34
0:01:47.760 --> 0:01:48.640
Okay, that's great.

35
0:01:48.640 --> 0:01:52.200
That was also an easy question in the room, real-time communication, right?

36
0:01:53.520 --> 0:01:57.240
So there is one working group that defined the standards for

37
0:01:57.240 --> 0:01:58.800
us on the market.

38
0:01:58.800 --> 0:02:05.200
So I thought that it was quite interesting to understand how it works and

39
0:02:05.200 --> 0:02:10.200
what are the topics, and maybe how to get involved into it so

40
0:02:10.200 --> 0:02:13.440
that the future is built by us, right?

41
0:02:13.440 --> 0:02:15.880
We are kind of part of the community.

42
0:02:15.880 --> 0:02:22.360
And the W3C is about getting the community to reach consensus.

43
0:02:22.360 --> 0:02:25.080
So it makes sense to be around the table.

44
0:02:25.080 --> 0:02:29.560
So in fact, first, I was interested to know more about that organization, and

45
0:02:29.560 --> 0:02:31.680
I think that it could be interesting for you too.

46
0:02:33.080 --> 0:02:34.480
By the way, I'm Romain.

47
0:02:35.760 --> 0:02:38.800
I work for a company, like everybody, right?

48
0:02:38.800 --> 0:02:45.720
And I'm a co-organizer at DevFest in my city.

49
0:02:45.720 --> 0:02:49.360
Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's asleep.

50
0:02:49.360 --> 0:02:50.360
All right, be back.

51
0:02:51.400 --> 0:02:58.760
And I was so a co-organizer at a meetup that will soon revive,

52
0:02:58.760 --> 0:03:02.080
which is called the WebRTC Paris meetup, soon revive,

53
0:03:02.080 --> 0:03:05.560
because it's been asleep for a few months, a few years, in fact.

54
0:03:06.720 --> 0:03:11.120
And so connect with me if you want to talk about those topics, of course.

55
0:03:11.120 --> 0:03:16.200
You can reach me on Twitch every Thursday also.

56
0:03:16.200 --> 0:03:18.400
Right, so I talked about that.

57
0:03:18.400 --> 0:03:24.560
There was been a standard that enables all the industry to agree on a protocol.

58
0:03:24.560 --> 0:03:30.760
It's called the WebRTC standard, and it came only in 2021.

59
0:03:30.760 --> 0:03:32.600
So it's very late, in fact.

60
0:03:32.600 --> 0:03:36.200
If you are in the WebRTC industry for a while,

61
0:03:37.320 --> 0:03:40.760
you use that protocol quite for a long time.

62
0:03:40.760 --> 0:03:44.920
It's not, 2021 is not the beginning.

63
0:03:44.920 --> 0:03:46.640
It's kind of the end.

64
0:03:46.640 --> 0:03:50.080
So that's kind of what W3C is,

65
0:03:50.080 --> 0:03:54.080
is making sure that we agree on something stable.

66
0:03:54.080 --> 0:03:59.160
So from that moment, you can build on solid foundations,

67
0:03:59.160 --> 0:04:02.320
your applications using WebRTC.

68
0:04:02.320 --> 0:04:05.040
And that's why it's quite interesting.

69
0:04:05.040 --> 0:04:08.520
What is quite interesting also is that it's a corporate

70
0:04:08.520 --> 0:04:14.600
action across W3C and also IETF.

71
0:04:14.600 --> 0:04:20.240
So W3C, the usage of it,

72
0:04:20.240 --> 0:04:24.200
and the other organization is more about how you structure the protocol,

73
0:04:24.200 --> 0:04:30.560
the networking protocol that enable the thing to flow across the clients.

74
0:04:30.560 --> 0:04:35.760
So that's quite interesting to join force on that particular topic.

75
0:04:35.760 --> 0:04:39.520
So they need to agree together, like the working group at W3C

76
0:04:39.520 --> 0:04:44.440
need to agree also with the working group at the EETF.

77
0:04:44.440 --> 0:04:47.120
I don't know how to pronounce that anyway.

78
0:04:47.120 --> 0:04:49.880
So yeah, happy, we've got a standard.

79
0:04:49.880 --> 0:04:55.120
But in fact, there is a lot of use cases that are already on the market.

80
0:04:55.120 --> 0:04:59.920
So what is the working group doing?

81
0:04:59.920 --> 0:05:03.920
So that's work group, the WebRTC work group.

82
0:05:03.920 --> 0:05:09.800
They accept any individual to contribute or to participate.

83
0:05:09.800 --> 0:05:13.440
They also encourage anyone, any company,

84
0:05:13.440 --> 0:05:17.440
anyone, any company or any organization to become a member.

85
0:05:17.440 --> 0:05:18.440
All right.

86
0:05:18.440 --> 0:05:23.680
So as an organization, you might be an end user,

87
0:05:23.680 --> 0:05:27.360
I mean, sorry, a company that build a solution based on that protocol,

88
0:05:27.360 --> 0:05:32.040
or you can be also a browser editor, for example.

89
0:05:32.040 --> 0:05:34.720
You can propose new standards.

90
0:05:34.720 --> 0:05:38.840
So that's quite powerful if you're a member, you can propose new standards.

91
0:05:38.840 --> 0:05:45.480
And as it's based on consensus, if your proposal is a need on the market,

92
0:05:45.480 --> 0:05:49.400
you will have a community that will gather around you.

93
0:05:49.400 --> 0:05:53.200
And then finally, you can reach that consensus.

94
0:05:53.200 --> 0:05:58.960
Otherwise, if your proposal is not needed or is not appropriate,

95
0:05:58.960 --> 0:06:05.800
you will suddenly have rejection from the community or just nobody around you.

96
0:06:05.800 --> 0:06:09.120
So you can't reach consensus if there is nobody around you, right?

97
0:06:09.120 --> 0:06:10.240
So that's how it works.

98
0:06:10.240 --> 0:06:12.120
It's kind of democratic, in fact.

99
0:06:12.120 --> 0:06:16.520
It's having people gathering and trying to get better together.

100
0:06:19.920 --> 0:06:22.520
Each working group has leaders.

101
0:06:22.520 --> 0:06:29.040
So at the W3C, sorry, the WebRCC working group,

102
0:06:29.040 --> 0:06:34.480
we've got leaders from Microsoft and Mozilla and,

103
0:06:34.480 --> 0:06:38.720
I can't remember the third one, like the big players, maybe Google,

104
0:06:38.720 --> 0:06:40.680
or maybe not, I can't remember.

105
0:06:40.680 --> 0:06:44.120
Anyway, so the big players are the leaders.

106
0:06:44.120 --> 0:06:49.280
And the leaders, being a leader is a role that involves you

107
0:06:49.280 --> 0:06:55.160
to push forward the group without taking directions.

108
0:06:55.160 --> 0:06:57.840
So you need to provide energy to the group.

109
0:06:57.840 --> 0:07:02.680
You need to make the whole process to go on and on.

110
0:07:02.680 --> 0:07:06.680
Make sure that there is a real consensus around the table.

111
0:07:06.680 --> 0:07:12.720
And trying to, in the end, realize the mission of the working group.

112
0:07:12.720 --> 0:07:20.480
So the WebRCC working group has some topics.

113
0:07:20.480 --> 0:07:25.000
So they worked on different topics in the past.

114
0:07:25.000 --> 0:07:29.960
We can have some mature topics that are already deployed

115
0:07:29.960 --> 0:07:34.320
in the different solutions, different browsers.

116
0:07:34.320 --> 0:07:40.160
And so you can recognize those APIs that you might use every day.

117
0:07:40.160 --> 0:07:45.160
So you can see that those APIs are widely accepted.

118
0:07:45.160 --> 0:07:45.880
They are solid.

119
0:07:45.880 --> 0:07:47.760
They are fundamental, in fact.

120
0:07:47.760 --> 0:07:49.360
So you can build on that.

121
0:07:49.360 --> 0:07:54.080
And there are also some topics that are still in discussion.

122
0:07:54.080 --> 0:07:56.920
More or less, mature, but still in discussion.

123
0:07:56.920 --> 0:08:00.880
And those are still moving things.

124
0:08:00.880 --> 0:08:05.240
You can see quite interesting topics in there.

125
0:08:05.240 --> 0:08:08.320
Especially topics that are optimization

126
0:08:08.320 --> 0:08:12.720
for having better quality, core quality, video quality

127
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:14.720
in your application.

128
0:08:14.720 --> 0:08:16.680
So it's like more technical things.

129
0:08:16.680 --> 0:08:20.120
And also things that are more related to the UX.

130
0:08:20.120 --> 0:08:25.200
How you will make the UX better when you handle the communication

131
0:08:25.200 --> 0:08:29.240
through the WebRCC APIs implemented in the browsers.

132
0:08:29.240 --> 0:08:34.000
For example, you've got this one, the capture handle.

133
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:36.720
This is something quite interesting.

134
0:08:36.720 --> 0:08:41.120
It's like making sure that when you are in a tab in a browser

135
0:08:41.120 --> 0:08:44.720
and then you share another tab in the browser,

136
0:08:44.720 --> 0:08:48.160
that the two tabs are aware of each other.

137
0:08:48.160 --> 0:08:53.200
So that you can know that you are sharing a tab on a specific domain,

138
0:08:53.200 --> 0:09:01.120
for example, so that you can adapt your behavior as a WebRCC

139
0:09:01.120 --> 0:09:02.200
application.

140
0:09:02.200 --> 0:09:04.640
You can adapt the behavior of your application

141
0:09:04.640 --> 0:09:06.760
depending on what is shared.

142
0:09:06.760 --> 0:09:12.960
And the contrary also is when you share, as a tab is shared,

143
0:09:12.960 --> 0:09:19.640
the tab knows that it is actually streaming the content somewhere else.

144
0:09:19.640 --> 0:09:25.240
So you might also adapt the content of the tab depending on that.

145
0:09:25.240 --> 0:09:27.560
So that's quite interesting, right?

146
0:09:27.560 --> 0:09:32.640
We haven't thought about that quite often.

147
0:09:32.640 --> 0:09:38.200
And this topic has been raised by members of the working group.

148
0:09:38.200 --> 0:09:41.640
So if you want to raise a topic, you can.

149
0:09:41.640 --> 0:09:42.320
You can do it.

150
0:09:46.120 --> 0:09:52.320
The WebRCC working group is as a statement that defined its mission.

151
0:09:52.320 --> 0:09:55.560
And in fact, in that statement, that fundamental statement,

152
0:09:55.560 --> 0:10:00.480
they try to see what are the use cases that want to reach.

153
0:10:00.480 --> 0:10:04.240
And that's also giving a glance of what should be, what could be,

154
0:10:04.240 --> 0:10:11.360
the WebRCC API in the future, or what could be done through that API.

155
0:10:11.360 --> 0:10:16.320
So for example, Firecherring, that's great use case.

156
0:10:16.320 --> 0:10:23.840
I don't know what it's so used.

157
0:10:23.840 --> 0:10:30.160
The Funny Hats use case, which brings a lot of technical challenges

158
0:10:30.160 --> 0:10:35.080
around that, and also bringing resources from the browser

159
0:10:35.080 --> 0:10:45.240
to get involved into the WebRCC protocol, and the rendering of the videos.

160
0:10:45.240 --> 0:10:48.560
And you've got those things that are trendy.

161
0:10:48.560 --> 0:10:54.200
All these things that analyzes off the voice and also the image.

162
0:10:54.200 --> 0:10:58.960
They call that face, but we can, to maybe a broader perspective,

163
0:10:58.960 --> 0:11:04.160
with saying, how do we do the analyzes?

164
0:11:04.160 --> 0:11:09.560
How do we bring value to what is going through the channel offered

165
0:11:09.560 --> 0:11:11.320
by WebRCC?

166
0:11:11.320 --> 0:11:16.240
How do we add intelligence on top of that?

167
0:11:16.240 --> 0:11:17.720
So that's in the roadmap.

168
0:11:17.720 --> 0:11:20.160
You might already do that in your application,

169
0:11:20.160 --> 0:11:24.440
trying to make sure that it's quite stable, using the APIs that

170
0:11:24.440 --> 0:11:28.520
could be provided by your browsers, like Chromium,

171
0:11:28.520 --> 0:11:32.920
or Firefox, or I don't know which one is Safari,

172
0:11:32.920 --> 0:11:35.960
and try to make sure that it's quite balanced.

173
0:11:35.960 --> 0:11:39.800
I mean, you try to cover the gaps.

174
0:11:39.800 --> 0:11:47.640
So you know that if it's still in discussion as a standard,

175
0:11:47.640 --> 0:11:50.960
it might move in the future.

176
0:11:50.960 --> 0:11:55.000
All right, we've got other use cases, like low latency broadcast

177
0:11:55.000 --> 0:11:56.600
with P2P release.

178
0:11:56.600 --> 0:12:00.160
That was quite a topic, I think.

179
0:12:00.160 --> 0:12:03.080
And that's a technical change, which is very high.

180
0:12:03.080 --> 0:12:05.120
But you know that it's something that

181
0:12:05.120 --> 0:12:11.680
might be addressed by the working group in the near future.

182
0:12:11.680 --> 0:12:13.560
So how do you contact?

183
0:12:13.560 --> 0:12:15.080
How do you get info?

184
0:12:15.080 --> 0:12:18.120
How do you engage with the working group?

185
0:12:18.120 --> 0:12:22.240
So that's kind of the API of the working group.

186
0:12:22.240 --> 0:12:23.920
They've got a website.

187
0:12:23.920 --> 0:12:25.320
There is plenty of things.

188
0:12:25.320 --> 0:12:27.560
It's an institution, right?

189
0:12:27.560 --> 0:12:29.840
It's an organization for standardization.

190
0:12:29.840 --> 0:12:34.120
So it's quite a massive amount of text.

191
0:12:34.120 --> 0:12:36.000
But there is also a monthly discussion.

192
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:39.800
So you can just broadcast it on YouTube.

193
0:12:39.800 --> 0:12:42.320
So you can drop by and listen to the topics that

194
0:12:42.320 --> 0:12:44.920
are currently discussed.

195
0:12:44.920 --> 0:12:46.920
It's quite technical topics, right?

196
0:12:46.920 --> 0:12:48.480
But it's very interesting to know

197
0:12:48.480 --> 0:12:54.000
how it works, like the process of getting a consensus.

198
0:12:54.000 --> 0:12:55.920
You've got some samples that you can

199
0:12:55.920 --> 0:12:58.520
try on the future implementation.

200
0:12:58.520 --> 0:13:00.960
So you've got those topics that are still in discussion.

201
0:13:00.960 --> 0:13:04.360
And when you go through that process,

202
0:13:04.360 --> 0:13:07.520
and at the end of the processes, they

203
0:13:07.520 --> 0:13:09.720
try to get to release some sample.

204
0:13:09.720 --> 0:13:13.520
What should be the standard should look like when

205
0:13:13.520 --> 0:13:15.760
you use that in the browser?

206
0:13:15.760 --> 0:13:18.800
Or you use it not only in the browser,

207
0:13:18.800 --> 0:13:23.160
but most of the samples are in browsers.

208
0:13:23.160 --> 0:13:24.880
And finally, there is a massive amount

209
0:13:24.880 --> 0:13:27.920
of working group repository.

210
0:13:27.920 --> 0:13:32.400
It's mainly repositories for handling

211
0:13:32.400 --> 0:13:34.800
the modifications of documents.

212
0:13:34.800 --> 0:13:37.160
As you want to progress as a standard,

213
0:13:37.160 --> 0:13:42.840
you need to agree on a formal documentation of the standard.

214
0:13:42.840 --> 0:13:45.120
And in fact, those repos are mostly

215
0:13:45.120 --> 0:13:50.000
used for making sure that everyone that has an issue

216
0:13:50.000 --> 0:13:51.760
can raise a point, and then the point

217
0:13:51.760 --> 0:13:54.120
can be discussed, and a proposal can also

218
0:13:54.120 --> 0:13:59.080
be done through those repos.

219
0:13:59.080 --> 0:14:02.240
If you are only a participant, not a member,

220
0:14:02.240 --> 0:14:05.320
you can go into that discussion.

221
0:14:05.320 --> 0:14:08.560
You can propose things.

222
0:14:08.560 --> 0:14:11.680
You don't have the voice.

223
0:14:11.680 --> 0:14:14.880
Your voice is not as powerful as if you were a member.

224
0:14:14.880 --> 0:14:18.200
But in fact, you can drop your ideas.

225
0:14:18.200 --> 0:14:20.440
And for having discussed with them,

226
0:14:20.440 --> 0:14:24.160
they're quite open with different point of view.

227
0:14:24.160 --> 0:14:28.240
And especially when you are a user of those technologies,

228
0:14:28.240 --> 0:14:30.920
they are kind to have some feedback on what

229
0:14:30.920 --> 0:14:33.240
they're proposing.

230
0:14:33.240 --> 0:14:34.760
How to engage?

231
0:14:34.760 --> 0:14:38.840
There is a massive event from the W3C

232
0:14:38.840 --> 0:14:41.720
that is happening in Siberia, which is quite near.

233
0:14:41.720 --> 0:14:46.120
I mean, it's not a good place.

234
0:14:46.120 --> 0:14:49.520
It will be in September next year.

235
0:14:49.520 --> 0:14:54.680
And there is also a mailing list and an IRC channel.

236
0:14:54.680 --> 0:14:57.840
How to contribute?

237
0:14:57.840 --> 0:15:01.040
They are promoting the thing that you use GitHub

238
0:15:01.040 --> 0:15:05.000
for any suggestion.

239
0:15:05.000 --> 0:15:07.240
They want to track everything.

240
0:15:07.240 --> 0:15:10.520
It's a distributed, decentralized working group.

241
0:15:10.520 --> 0:15:13.440
So they want things to be written so that also it's

242
0:15:13.440 --> 0:15:17.960
precise, so that it can be discussed afterward

243
0:15:17.960 --> 0:15:20.760
in a meeting.

244
0:15:20.760 --> 0:15:22.960
You can propose new topics if you want.

245
0:15:22.960 --> 0:15:26.120
For example, I talked about starting something

246
0:15:26.120 --> 0:15:29.560
about energy consumption and web RTC.

247
0:15:29.560 --> 0:15:30.520
That might be good.

248
0:15:30.520 --> 0:15:34.200
Also to understand how we impact the energy

249
0:15:34.200 --> 0:15:36.720
consumption of all the high-end devices

250
0:15:36.720 --> 0:15:38.960
and also maybe in the networks across,

251
0:15:38.960 --> 0:15:45.320
to understand what is our impact on developing new features,

252
0:15:45.320 --> 0:15:47.440
and trying to get that into the balance when

253
0:15:47.440 --> 0:15:49.240
you choose adding new features.

254
0:15:52.080 --> 0:15:54.320
And if you want to get more info, I'm not.

255
0:15:54.320 --> 0:15:55.720
Yeah, yeah, I'm about.

256
0:15:55.720 --> 0:15:57.800
It has the last slide.

257
0:15:57.800 --> 0:15:59.160
I'm about to.

258
0:15:59.160 --> 0:16:00.000
Sorry, sorry.

259
0:16:00.000 --> 0:16:04.480
So I'm not from the W3C, just for you to know.

260
0:16:04.480 --> 0:16:06.640
But you can reach out those people.

261
0:16:06.640 --> 0:16:10.720
And they are dedicated staff for the WebRTC working group.

262
0:16:10.720 --> 0:16:11.760
They are very friendly.

263
0:16:11.760 --> 0:16:12.920
They are open for discussion.

264
0:16:12.920 --> 0:16:16.160
They can also bring you on the boat.

265
0:16:16.160 --> 0:16:18.480
So just reach out to them.

266
0:16:18.480 --> 0:16:22.440
And you can find those slides in my GitHub account.

267
0:16:22.440 --> 0:16:23.960
Thank you.

268
0:16:23.960 --> 0:16:24.440
Just in time.

269
0:16:24.440 --> 0:16:30.560
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

270
0:16:30.560 --> 0:16:32.120
All right.

271
0:16:32.120 --> 0:16:37.480
Join me on every Thursday at the WebRTC World Card Show.

272
0:16:37.480 --> 0:16:38.440
It's on Twitch.

273
0:16:38.440 --> 0:16:38.920
Thank you.

274
0:16:42.160 --> 0:16:44.680
Any question?

275
0:16:44.680 --> 0:16:45.560
No.

276
0:16:45.560 --> 0:16:46.060
Yes.

277
0:16:49.080 --> 0:16:50.880
Yeah.

278
0:16:50.880 --> 0:16:53.840
What are you exactly doing from the perspective

279
0:16:53.840 --> 0:16:57.080
of the decentralizing messaging?

280
0:16:57.080 --> 0:16:58.680
Me, myself?

281
0:16:58.680 --> 0:17:01.160
No, nothing.

282
0:17:01.160 --> 0:17:01.680
No.

283
0:17:01.680 --> 0:17:05.000
In fact, so there is no, as far as I know,

284
0:17:05.000 --> 0:17:11.040
I went through a lot of reports of what

285
0:17:11.040 --> 0:17:13.240
is happening in the working group.

286
0:17:13.240 --> 0:17:17.880
And I have not seen much thing about decentralized messaging.

287
0:17:17.880 --> 0:17:20.840
But if you want to start something about that,

288
0:17:20.840 --> 0:17:22.440
they are OK for getting some help.

289
0:17:32.040 --> 0:17:32.600
Any question?

290
0:17:36.000 --> 0:17:36.480
Thank you.

291
0:17:36.480 --> 0:17:36.960
Thank you.

292
0:17:36.960 --> 0:17:37.440
Thank you.

293
0:17:37.440 --> 0:17:43.600
Thanks a lot.
