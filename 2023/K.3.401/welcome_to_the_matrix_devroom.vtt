00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Welcome, everybody.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Even live on time.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to the first ever in real life matrix dev room.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Hey!

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Who would have thought we would get there when we came here for the first time in 2015?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, honestly.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
A little bit of a surprise.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
But hey, this is really cool.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
We're back in one physical place.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Last off to at least three years ago.

00:26.000 --> 00:40.000
We have to do this bit because people might be really lost in the room right now or they might be viewing this online and have no idea what they're getting into.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
So, Amandine, what is matrix?

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
So, as you can read, it's an open network for secure and decentralized realtime communications.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
So, a lot of you probably know it for chat and voice over IP.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
But we can do many things on matrix, as we will see today.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
Of course, the chat, the voice over IP, IOT, and then VR, 3D worlds, et cetera.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
We should probably introduce ourselves.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm Matthew.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm the technical project lead and co-founder.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
And Amandine, I'm a matrix co-founder.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Basically, the responsible person who tries to keep everything on track and let me play with computers.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So, our mission.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Slightly changing it this year, actually.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
Because I think we're kind of converging on matrix trying to be the realtime communication layer of the open web.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
It's kind of the idea all along.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
And it's a bit over the top to put it in writing when we began.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
But the reality is increasingly that's where things are moving towards.

01:44.000 --> 01:53.000
You can say that I know activity pub is more of a sort of realtime microblogging or information sharing layer, RSS on steroids.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Whereas with matrix, we're really trying to go as low latency as we will be talking about in a few minutes.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
And sort of realtime instant messaging, whatever, on top.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
So, the way it works, we said decentralized.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
A bunch of servers who can talk to one another, a bunch of clients attached to the servers in green on the graph.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
But the key thing with matrix, it's called matrix for a reason.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
It's because it's matrixing all the different networks out there.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
There is when we created it, we didn't think everyone would jump on it like this.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
We thought that the interesting and the intelligent thing to do is probably to connect all the existing things so everyone could benefit from it.

02:35.000 --> 02:48.000
The name matrix came from basically a conversation where we said, hey, it would be really cool if there was a name like matrix that we could use to describe this kind of substrate in which all these different things could be embedded.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Like matrix comes from Latin, where it means uterus, where things grow, where you go and embed things.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And it's where the word mother and matron comes from and maternal.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
And we thought that would be a pretty cool thing to kind of describe the idea of linking it all together.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
But no, we obviously couldn't call it matrix because of the film.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Then we realized that the film came out 15 years earlier and that was already what, eight years ago and so forth.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
It was nine.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Is it really?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And for hey, we'll use it anyway.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
And we did.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
And also matrix.org used to be a really nasty website and so it was available.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
What are the stats looking like?

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
Basically, there has been 87 million users registered in the whole matrix network until today.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
So it's growing quite nicely.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The thing is, these are only users we can see and know of.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
So a whole bunch of them are probably just hiding into big closed networks which are not connected and never talk to us.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Yeah.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
So I mean, just before transparency on this graph, which we show a lot.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
And it's obvious.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
I mean, the important thing is the shape of the graph rather than necessarily the absolute numbers because this is actually based on the phone home stats.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
It's in apps.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It's in apps.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Hasn't it?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
So there aren't any dendrites or constructs or conduits and flying around in here.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Also, it is literally total MX IDs that server has ever seen.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
So it is including bridged users.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
It's including guests, et cetera.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
And the way to think of it is that literally half of these are actually bridged and then about another half of them are guests.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So if you wanted the non-guest actually registered fully signed up users, it's possibly reducing it by a quarter.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
But we prefer the bigger number.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Sometime it's going to be larger than the number of humans on the planet and then it's going to start looking a little bit awkward.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
It still means it's people you can talk to on Matrix if they're connected.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
But so, yeah, they're actual users.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
I for one will be reaching out to guest 4 4 4 5 4 4 2 on Matrix.org from September 2013.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
The other small stat on the corner is across at least 100000 deployments.

04:53.000 --> 05:02.000
Again, that we know of and it ranges from Raspberry Pis, which I'm sure many of you have in the room, all the way up to Matrix.org.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
And it's like 13 14 million users.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
And when the middle servers for enterprises, governments and anyone basically also also sub-size.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And again, disclaimer on the stat here for 100000 servers.

05:15.000 --> 05:26.000
This is based on looking at the destinations table on Matrix.org, which is about 50000 at the moment and doubling it based on the number of servers which we can't see out there on the network.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
So who uses it?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm going to seriously go through all of these logos.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
We've only got like three minutes before Jan rubby tackles us off the stage.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, we've put just a bunch of logos out there.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
So obviously, yes, I hope you've been following first time on Matrix and hello to everyone out there who is currently streaming from Matrix.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
So we're always very proud to be hosting first time waves to the camera.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Hello. I was looking for it.

05:54.000 --> 06:05.000
And a whole bunch of different projects that hopefully you know a whole bunch of cluster of governments out there who made the right choice and went for data sovereignty.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, it's a bit crazy that I mean, we've missed out some of the sort of companies who we know use it.

06:11.000 --> 06:23.000
But honestly, a large number are my governments, whether that's France or Germany, Germany, again, UK, NATO, Luxembourg, Sweden, Ukraine or open source projects.

06:23.000 --> 06:33.000
It's not the most obvious mix, but there was a huge footprint, obviously, on both sides, but also a bunch of companies, obviously, probably including people in the room using it to apologize if your logo or country is not on here.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
And if it isn't on here, but you don't use matrix, stop using teams and get on board.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
In terms of vital stats, where to start?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Cauldron.io.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
If people don't know Cauldron.io, it's really good.

06:48.000 --> 06:59.000
You'd basically just give it a GitHub or a GitLab repository, sorry, organization, and it goes and spiders the whole thing, puts in Elasticsearch and gives you the Elasticsearch kind of credentials to go in and do whatever you want with the stats.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
So this is looking at it from 2014 with a number of committers, number of issues and reviews.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm not sure what happened with our reviews in 2020, but there was a mad reviewing frenzy.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Covid.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, people got really bored and reviewed all their PRs at last.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But yeah, some of the stats is we got 4000 committers.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
If you sum all of the GitHub stars over the matrix organization, it comes to over 50,000 and we're not double counting anybody there at all.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And then, loads of clients, 40 is way more than that.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I should have reviewed this.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, I should have reviewed it. I tried to figure out.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
My preferred one is this one.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
We have projects with over 30 different programming languages.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
We're getting almost kicked out, Matthew.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Okay, we've got two minutes.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
We're just going to talk quicker.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Easy, easy.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
So, yes, 30 programming languages from everywhere, all sorts, and that's really fun.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
So, today's menu, lots of talks. We're not going to go through them because we have a QR code.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Plus, you already know, because you're probably sitting here or you're looking at it on the Internet.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
We've got a URL that nobody will be able to see, but it's the same as the one on the blackboard there.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
And also, follow along on, yeah, the schedules there.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
But follow along on Matrix.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
There are going to be people out there in the void who we should connect with physically and create a proper hybrid room.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Welcome.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Welcome. Hope you will have fun.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
And over to Florian.

08:22.000 --> 08:51.000
Thank you.
