00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What is the best way to get your sleep?

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
The first time, everybody will be tired and wasted.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
Then I'm here with a dog with sheets full of text and some really interesting policies

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
combined with some technical questions.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
So that's a nice way to get you all to sleep and not leave you for them anymore.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm Winfried Tillanes. I'm a privacy consultant.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm also a member of the XMPB Standard Foundation.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
And I'm long-term and more and more also at the brink between technology and policy.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
So I tend to look at acts from the European Union and things like that.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
And this act caught my eye. You may have heard about it because it also has some more news.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a digital market act.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
And it has some interesting things because the European Commission can designate big companies as gatekeeper.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
And you have to think about a meta with WhatsApp and Facebook chat.

01:21.000 --> 01:34.000
You can think about Apple's chat, about Google's chat, Instagram, maybe perhaps Telegram

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
because it is also quite big user base.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Companies like that might be designated as gatekeepers.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
And when you're designated as gatekeeper, there's a process that will be in the second half,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
which will be started in the second half of this year.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
After you've been designated, you have to open up your chat within three months.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Two years later, you must also open up your group chat.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
And four years later, you also must have your video enforced calling opened.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
And right now, in the start, it's okay to open it by just publishing an API.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
But the European Commission in all its wisdom may decide to draft a standard for interoperability.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
And if they do so, then all these, their own API won't surface anymore.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Then you have to follow that standard.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
And they also said that standard has to be drafted by European standards organization.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So it has to be the SIN or the ETSI.

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
Also interesting, they say some more nice things about it because that API or that standard

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
must have the same security features as their own product of the company.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
And it must be neutral, so it must not be crippled in such a way that nobody wants to use it

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
or that there are some conditions to it that really puts it backwards compared to their own products.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Well, I read this and I had a dash of food.

03:24.000 --> 03:33.000
Because some years ago, the Dutch Ministry of Health had a problem with interoperable security.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
So they asked for a standard about yet to make it interoperable and secure.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
And they gave that assignment to the NAND that did standardization institute.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
And I happened to be chairing the working group, drafting that somewhat.

03:54.000 --> 04:03.000
So I went in all kinds of things and questions and things that happened there.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
So I thought why not combine my two experiences of this experience with what the European Commission is aiming at.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
And let's have a look on what we are dealing with.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
When I think about the European Commission, it's about the question what do you mean by secure?

04:25.000 --> 04:34.000
Fender A says we are secure because we offer the best end-to-end encryption in the world.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Nobody can eavesdrop. This is the most secure solution you have.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
Fender B says we monitor all communications and feel all harmful content.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
So everybody is safe on this platform.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Well, tell me, let's put your pants.

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
Would you think A is the most secure one? Would you think B is the most secure one?

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
Nobody. But even the European Commission is sometimes aiming at security like B.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
So there is a big misunderstanding about what do you mean by secure.

05:25.000 --> 05:36.000
And it's kind of difficult to add A to B, isn't it?

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
And end-to-end encryption does have its drawbacks because both clients must support the same end-to-end protocol.

05:44.000 --> 05:54.000
So you can't have one do end-to-end encryption based on the matrix or OPPGP and the other one on OPPoVispo or something like that.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
It must be the same with all the key exchanges and everything.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
And spam detection, harmful content detection, we may like it or we may not like it.

06:06.000 --> 06:14.000
It is a thing and it is an important part of the security model of some platforms.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And there's also one interesting thing that I thought about.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, nice end-to-end encrypted platform opens up with a nice API.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
I can connect to that API. That API is also end-to-end encrypted.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
Before it was open, they had their own clients that sent and received the message.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
So they knew what was injected into the network.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
And it was in such a way that nothing went wrong when it was received by the client.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
And now I can write my own client, maybe even a first-in-client or something like that, and inject whatever I want into the network.

06:54.000 --> 07:04.000
So they may even get a security risk because they can't monitor, can't filter out all the nice attacks I inject into the network.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
So that might be quite interesting.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
And end-to-end encryption may also have intellectual property issues.

07:14.000 --> 07:25.000
When there's some proprietary encryption protocol that the vendor bought a nice license to, like Potsy update,

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
then they may say, well, here's the API. This is the protocol. And if you want to use it, buy your own license.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, that's an interesting business case from Maximilian's bike.

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
So there's quite a bit of issues of already once being secure.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
Oh, that was going too fast.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
What's really important here to understand, this is a political decision.

07:56.000 --> 08:05.000
The European Commission may say what they mean with secure and how end-to-end encryption would fit in that picture.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
If they don't try to push it to a standardization organization, then it will be mayhem.

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
And I can tell from my own experience, I can also reveal the standardization project in the Netherlands failed

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
because they didn't define what they meant by secure.

08:27.000 --> 08:37.000
But we did come up with a standard in the Netherlands.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
It was for healthcare, so it is quite a specific use case.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
We standardized to secure servers.

08:49.000 --> 09:02.000
So the premise was that when a healthcare organization sets up a certain server or buys a certain size server,

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
that server was meant for this job and secured in a proper level.

09:08.000 --> 09:17.000
No end-to-end encryption because some of them had a security model that relied on securing the data on the server

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and not keeping anything on the client.

09:20.000 --> 09:29.000
And the whole network between the whole healthcare providers would be authorized.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It won't be an open network.

09:32.000 --> 09:46.000
And exactly that last point was where the project was killed because some vendors wanted to have another direction there.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
And then the next question is, when you say interoperable, interoperable with VU,

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
may you publish an API? Is it sufficient to publish an API so clients can connect?

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
You said, nobody knows. European Commission didn't say anything here.

10:06.000 --> 10:19.000
Maybe when you read the law quite close, this is maybe not exactly what they meant, but they're not really clear about it.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
It would also mean that when you write a chat client, it would be interoperable with all vendors,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
that it needs to implement all those APIs.

10:27.000 --> 10:37.000
Or is it like we did in healthcare, is this a server-to-server with limited parties?

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
So a walled garden of some systems that are interoperable with each other.

10:44.000 --> 10:53.000
Or is it really open federation, a server-to-server for whoever sets up a server and connects to it?

10:53.000 --> 11:04.000
No idea. But it's quite hard to start standardization process if you don't have any idea about what's happening here.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
And I'm good in time.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
Then there are the big questions about functionalities.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Because chat isn't just chat.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
When you look at whatever chat client you use, you have all nifty features, starting with slash me,

11:26.000 --> 11:42.000
and then repeating your own nickname up to all kinds of fancy stickers being sent around of emojis you can add to a message and things like that.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
There are lots of functionalities that a chat can have.

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
And certainly when you enter encryption, you can't have the server in between translated or say,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
well, I handled this in this way, that must all be done by the clients.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
And that means for all of these functionalities, you must make a choice about how you're going to handle it.

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
Is this an obligatory functionality that must be part of the protocol, that must be implemented then by all clients?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Or is it optional?

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
And making a functionality optional means that you need to have something like service that's going for me.

12:25.000 --> 12:33.000
Or do you say, no, this is not part of the standard and you don't have to be interoperable for this functionality.

12:33.000 --> 12:45.000
And well, we are talking about what kind of functionalities.

12:45.000 --> 13:03.000
So, big.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
Almost. I did leave things out.

13:09.000 --> 13:18.000
Mainly because there were things, for example, like services go for me, certain ways of connecting, how you standardize exactly the connection.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
I guess that's in a player and not on the functionality layer you have to choose.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
But this is the kind of things you're talking about when you start standardizing this.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
And I have a nice time to discuss some of them.

13:37.000 --> 13:48.000
When you look at attaching an emoji to a message, well, you think emoji, that's part of the UTF-8 character set.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
So you can just say, this is the message and then put this emoji to it.

13:54.000 --> 14:05.000
But some clients don't support all kind of emojis, either in sending or receiving.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
They have only a limited set of emoji you can attach to a message.

14:09.000 --> 14:22.000
And also to get something like that done, you maybe need some services go free to check what emoji are available at a client.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And then you can tell your client these are the emoji you can send.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Or maybe you just send an emoji and notice it doesn't work.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Not really the best way of interoperability.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
And then there's also something like, oh, no, that was the wrong one.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I need to tap another one.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
So you need to correct that one or delete it from this.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
It was inappropriate to do this.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
So let's get it out.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.000
So when you start looking at attaching an emoji to a message, it looks like a quite straightforward functionality.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
When you start thinking through interoperability context.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Then it might be quite interesting.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Quite a nice thing.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I also like to move notification.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
When you send a message to somebody on platform A, that you can get a response back.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
No, I'm now somewhere else on a different account on the same platform.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
Or maybe on a different account on a totally different platform.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It's a nice one to standardize maybe.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't know if all platforms would like that.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.000
And if they'd like to cripple that one or not.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Well, are there some?

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
One minute?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah.

15:50.000 --> 16:00.000
So is there one other one maybe I should talk about or should we just go straight on to the questions?

16:00.000 --> 16:10.000
So thank you.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
So first in the back, that was the first sentence raised.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
Something that I maybe missed, when exactly is some party designated as gatekeepers?

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
As soon as you provide any sort of dead service or some amount of users?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Can you repeat the question for the recording?

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
The question is when is the party designated as gatekeeper?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
There's a whole set of rules.

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
And it mainly means that you have a big market share, a big turnover on it, one way or the other,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
either on advertising or on just paying customers.

16:50.000 --> 17:00.000
And it looks really like the list I mentioned at the beginning will be the list that will be designated and others not.

17:00.000 --> 17:13.000
But you really have to be very large and be one of the biggest players in the field to get that nice status.

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
You mentioned that the Dutch initiative failed because what was meant with security was not defined.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
But why didn't somebody in the group say, okay, we're going to define security like this and go ahead?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Well, I did.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, yeah, I said you'd be. So the question is why didn't somebody in the group define security and just go ahead?

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
Well, I did. And that was exactly the moment that it failed.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
That is a lesson in it.

17:54.000 --> 18:11.000
The issue was really from commercial perspective. There are some vendors on the table that had different reasons to say, well, I don't want this definition of secure.

18:11.000 --> 18:23.000
And they made big mess. I got really I wasn't really prepared for that meeting that I really was totally furthered by one vendor.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
There was all kind of confusion raised in the group.

18:27.000 --> 18:38.000
And then we needed to do some new cycles about what's how to get out of this.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
And that was the moment that the government said, well, this takes too long.

18:42.000 --> 18:51.000
We're gone. Well, this part of the problem was they didn't define what secure is.

18:51.000 --> 19:05.000
So a lesson learned. And I think it's a very good question because we should do the same trick of the be careful for the same issue and maybe be clear to the European Commission.

19:05.000 --> 19:17.000
Tell us what you mean by secure. We can't standardize if you don't tell us.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
I saw two fingers there or probably basically saying so.

19:21.000 --> 19:38.000
So my question was, did somebody ask and he said the problem with asking is that they might actually tell you and they might actually tell you at least if they don't tell you we can dream a little bit that it might be a.

19:38.000 --> 19:55.000
The point is in most standardization situations, you have a bunch of vendors who are intrinsic transiently motivated to cooperate and to work together.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
And then they can discuss nicely about the good questions standardization like this is with vendors.

20:01.000 --> 20:10.000
We don't want to. And that's a big also big issue when he pushes to a standardization organization because they're not up to it.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
But if you're sitting there with vendors, we don't want to. They will blow up the process.

20:15.000 --> 20:23.000
So the only way to avoid it is to make sure that somebody sets the limits makes clear.

20:23.000 --> 20:36.000
You have to do it this way and otherwise you can leave the table, but you will still have a stand that you have to adhere to.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Sorry, guys, for time.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
I switch.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:55.000
I would go to the old age and be a terrible question.
