1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:26.840
the

2
0:00:26.840 --> 0:00:29.360
if you already all I've found to this year.

3
0:00:29.360 --> 0:00:30.040
Yes.

4
0:00:30.040 --> 0:00:32.720
So we go on with our next speaker,

5
0:00:32.720 --> 0:00:37.280
Mikaeli, who is talk to us about the FBI improved image viewer.

6
0:00:37.280 --> 0:00:39.280
Please welcome Mikaeli.

7
0:00:41.280 --> 0:00:49.200
So welcome to my talk about using the film image viewer.

8
0:00:49.200 --> 0:00:52.960
Around 2006, I was a user of FBI,

9
0:00:52.960 --> 0:00:57.120
the image viewer for the Linux frame buffer.

10
0:00:57.120 --> 0:01:01.880
I was fond of it, but at some point I thought I really need to

11
0:01:01.880 --> 0:01:06.280
have the VIM arrow keys into FBI,

12
0:01:06.280 --> 0:01:08.760
and I made a patch to FBI.

13
0:01:08.760 --> 0:01:12.400
At some point, I started realizing that I need something more,

14
0:01:12.400 --> 0:01:14.920
like some shortcuts,

15
0:01:14.920 --> 0:01:18.760
bindings, or a small command line,

16
0:01:18.760 --> 0:01:22.160
commands, at some point a parser,

17
0:01:22.160 --> 0:01:23.400
autocompletion.

18
0:01:23.400 --> 0:01:25.480
So hack after hack,

19
0:01:25.480 --> 0:01:28.000
a fork came out of FBI,

20
0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:29.320
which I called film.

21
0:01:29.320 --> 0:01:33.520
So something which takes inspiration from the VIM text editor,

22
0:01:33.520 --> 0:01:37.080
the map, mail user,

23
0:01:37.080 --> 0:01:39.760
and well, sorry, mail user agent,

24
0:01:39.760 --> 0:01:41.840
and the shell languages.

25
0:01:41.840 --> 0:01:45.240
So what is nowadays film?

26
0:01:45.240 --> 0:01:48.520
It's a Unix tool, a Unix tool for one task.

27
0:01:48.520 --> 0:01:51.160
One task which is viewing images.

28
0:01:51.160 --> 0:01:55.600
It's not editing images, so many people confound this.

29
0:01:55.600 --> 0:01:57.840
It's for command line users,

30
0:01:57.840 --> 0:02:00.320
people who like using the keyboard.

31
0:02:00.320 --> 0:02:02.920
It has a configuration file,

32
0:02:02.920 --> 0:02:06.160
because it's nice to configure custom commands.

33
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:11.160
It uses regular expressions, standard inputs, standard output,

34
0:02:11.160 --> 0:02:14.120
and it plays nice in scripts.

35
0:02:14.120 --> 0:02:16.440
So it's highly interoperable.

36
0:02:16.440 --> 0:02:18.840
The Amoto is like in parallel,

37
0:02:18.840 --> 0:02:23.200
like in parallel, there is more than one way to do it.

38
0:02:23.200 --> 0:02:27.160
I think film plays well with all the hardware.

39
0:02:27.160 --> 0:02:31.840
There are functionalities for caching files or

40
0:02:31.840 --> 0:02:36.880
image from files to load them in advance via prefetching,

41
0:02:36.880 --> 0:02:39.360
so to spare a bit of IO.

42
0:02:39.360 --> 0:02:41.920
The user interface is quite minimal,

43
0:02:41.920 --> 0:02:43.160
so there are no menus,

44
0:02:43.160 --> 0:02:45.640
no buttons, sorry, at the moment.

45
0:02:45.640 --> 0:02:49.400
It works at the moment with four outputs,

46
0:02:49.400 --> 0:02:51.760
graphical outputs styles.

47
0:02:51.760 --> 0:02:54.240
So pixels with X11,

48
0:02:54.240 --> 0:02:56.600
pixels with Linux frame buffer,

49
0:02:56.600 --> 0:02:59.600
and ASCII art with and without color.

50
0:02:59.600 --> 0:03:05.840
It plays a bit nice under SSH or screen in different situations.

51
0:03:05.840 --> 0:03:09.160
So on this picture here, you say a pixel mode,

52
0:03:10.680 --> 0:03:14.840
character mode, and other character modes without the colors.

53
0:03:14.840 --> 0:03:17.400
So you select this when you start the program,

54
0:03:17.400 --> 0:03:19.880
or you let it just being

55
0:03:19.880 --> 0:03:24.120
auto-detected by the environment variables.

56
0:03:24.240 --> 0:03:27.960
The basic invocation of film is more or

57
0:03:27.960 --> 0:03:31.480
less like what you expect from most programs.

58
0:03:31.480 --> 0:03:34.480
So you specify the files you want to open,

59
0:03:34.480 --> 0:03:37.920
and in the case of graphical files,

60
0:03:37.920 --> 0:03:41.200
the magic number will determine which decoder to use,

61
0:03:41.200 --> 0:03:42.320
not the file extension.

62
0:03:42.320 --> 0:03:44.480
However, if you want to open a directory,

63
0:03:44.480 --> 0:03:47.600
or recursively three of directories,

64
0:03:47.600 --> 0:03:51.080
or perhaps even with a background load function,

65
0:03:51.080 --> 0:03:55.400
then filtering on file names will occur.

66
0:03:55.880 --> 0:03:59.800
Again, it's quite intuitive what

67
0:03:59.800 --> 0:04:03.320
the plus minus page up, page down keys do.

68
0:04:03.320 --> 0:04:06.200
So it's what you expect, and this is good.

69
0:04:06.200 --> 0:04:09.520
What they do, usually, of course,

70
0:04:09.520 --> 0:04:12.240
the binding is dynamic,

71
0:04:12.240 --> 0:04:15.880
so you can configure film to do different things.

72
0:04:15.880 --> 0:04:22.040
The defaults are for plus to call the magnify command,

73
0:04:22.040 --> 0:04:24.040
the internal magnify command,

74
0:04:24.040 --> 0:04:26.520
for minus the reduce command,

75
0:04:26.520 --> 0:04:28.680
or apart from commands,

76
0:04:28.680 --> 0:04:32.520
you have also small actions which can be longer,

77
0:04:32.520 --> 0:04:35.000
can be like a concatenation of,

78
0:04:35.000 --> 0:04:36.880
let's say, command argument,

79
0:04:36.880 --> 0:04:43.280
or even a small control flow expression.

80
0:04:43.280 --> 0:04:46.480
So it's quite rich,

81
0:04:46.480 --> 0:04:50.680
what you can assign to single keys.

82
0:04:50.680 --> 0:04:54.320
So in general, this language which I show here in

83
0:04:54.320 --> 0:04:59.080
this red boxes, it lives in the command line.

84
0:04:59.080 --> 0:05:01.800
The command line which hosts this language,

85
0:05:01.800 --> 0:05:04.400
which you can also access with the column key,

86
0:05:04.400 --> 0:05:07.360
just like in VIM, and just like in VIM and other

87
0:05:07.360 --> 0:05:09.840
other softwares with the tab,

88
0:05:09.840 --> 0:05:13.360
you might get some auto-completion of, I don't know,

89
0:05:13.360 --> 0:05:15.840
commands, variable names.

90
0:05:15.840 --> 0:05:17.720
It's not science fiction,

91
0:05:17.720 --> 0:05:21.360
so it can be helpful.

92
0:05:21.360 --> 0:05:24.120
Yeah, and this is the same language that you also use in

93
0:05:24.120 --> 0:05:26.040
the configuration files and scripts.

94
0:05:26.040 --> 0:05:28.360
So that is the film language.

95
0:05:28.360 --> 0:05:31.920
The language elements of film are commands,

96
0:05:31.920 --> 0:05:34.840
alliances, which you can customize,

97
0:05:34.840 --> 0:05:38.360
variables built-in or customizable,

98
0:05:38.360 --> 0:05:41.680
if-while blocks, so to have a bit of control,

99
0:05:41.680 --> 0:05:43.760
and some special syntax like

100
0:05:43.760 --> 0:05:47.800
shortcut expressions or shortcut statements

101
0:05:47.800 --> 0:05:51.200
for some other precise things.

102
0:05:51.200 --> 0:05:52.760
How do I use film?

103
0:05:52.760 --> 0:05:54.520
I don't spend much time programming it,

104
0:05:54.520 --> 0:05:56.800
or programming the usage of film.

105
0:05:56.800 --> 0:05:58.400
Most of the time, I use it

106
0:05:58.400 --> 0:06:01.320
interactively as any other image viewer.

107
0:06:01.320 --> 0:06:03.800
Especially to organize pictures collections,

108
0:06:03.800 --> 0:06:04.880
like I will show later.

109
0:06:04.880 --> 0:06:08.240
Occasionally, I use the special functionality.

110
0:06:08.240 --> 0:06:11.480
So what is really unique to film or the command line,

111
0:06:11.480 --> 0:06:13.400
it's quite rarely when I come up with

112
0:06:13.400 --> 0:06:15.360
some nice workflow which I like.

113
0:06:15.360 --> 0:06:17.880
Yes, then I exchange the configuration file,

114
0:06:17.880 --> 0:06:21.520
or even made, I do an alias in the shell

115
0:06:21.520 --> 0:06:25.320
to reuse some special way of calling film,

116
0:06:25.320 --> 0:06:28.360
which is for me, which is customized for me.

117
0:06:28.360 --> 0:06:31.240
So now we will continue with this talk.

118
0:06:31.240 --> 0:06:33.120
I just wanted to mention that another talk,

119
0:06:33.120 --> 0:06:35.440
which has been recorded,

120
0:06:35.440 --> 0:06:37.840
will go into language-specific topics.

121
0:06:37.840 --> 0:06:40.040
That is a bit more nerdy than this.

122
0:06:40.040 --> 0:06:45.240
This talk here goes about the interactive usage of film.

123
0:06:45.240 --> 0:06:47.600
This is not really a tutorial,

124
0:06:47.600 --> 0:06:48.920
it's not really the documentation,

125
0:06:48.920 --> 0:06:50.360
it's a bit of a showcase,

126
0:06:50.360 --> 0:06:51.880
what I will be showing here.

127
0:06:51.880 --> 0:06:55.240
So I said, film is programmable,

128
0:06:55.240 --> 0:06:57.080
but you don't want to program it here at

129
0:06:57.080 --> 0:06:59.160
this in what I'm showing you here,

130
0:06:59.160 --> 0:07:01.520
but still you want to use a bit of automation.

131
0:07:01.520 --> 0:07:04.080
The base level of automation is

132
0:07:04.080 --> 0:07:06.760
perhaps to simulate a key press.

133
0:07:06.760 --> 0:07:10.520
So when you invoke film and specify minus K,

134
0:07:10.520 --> 0:07:14.560
the name of a character or of a key press, that will happen.

135
0:07:14.560 --> 0:07:17.520
So as you press that key.

136
0:07:18.440 --> 0:07:21.760
So for R, we'll rotate.

137
0:07:21.760 --> 0:07:24.360
I mean, this is what will happen just after startup.

138
0:07:24.360 --> 0:07:25.920
Afterwards, you are in control.

139
0:07:25.920 --> 0:07:27.560
So with R, we'd rotate,

140
0:07:27.560 --> 0:07:31.240
with delete, we'll delete the first image from the list,

141
0:07:31.240 --> 0:07:33.120
with CH, control H,

142
0:07:33.120 --> 0:07:38.280
we'll make help pop up and so on.

143
0:07:38.280 --> 0:07:42.600
You can go further with minus upper case K,

144
0:07:42.600 --> 0:07:45.360
so with key combos.

145
0:07:45.360 --> 0:07:47.720
So if you specify minus big K,

146
0:07:47.720 --> 0:07:50.320
RA, rotate, and auto-scale,

147
0:07:50.320 --> 0:07:53.720
that will happen as the first thing with film starts once.

148
0:07:53.720 --> 0:07:56.160
So afterwards, you're in control.

149
0:07:56.160 --> 0:08:02.960
In VIM, I appreciate that when you're about to press a key,

150
0:08:02.960 --> 0:08:06.120
and you prepend it with a digit or more digits,

151
0:08:06.120 --> 0:08:08.480
the number that you will have specified,

152
0:08:08.480 --> 0:08:13.200
will specify also the repetition of what is about to be done.

153
0:08:13.200 --> 0:08:14.960
So you have this also here.

154
0:08:14.960 --> 0:08:17.200
Of course, now I'm showing you here the command line,

155
0:08:17.200 --> 0:08:18.800
but this is the interactive usage.

156
0:08:18.800 --> 0:08:21.560
So should we do it interactively, this is what happens.

157
0:08:21.560 --> 0:08:26.000
It's the same interpreter who processes this.

158
0:08:26.000 --> 0:08:30.440
But there's also the dot modifier in VIM,

159
0:08:30.440 --> 0:08:35.920
and also here, that instead of repeating twice a particular command,

160
0:08:35.920 --> 0:08:41.400
you can add a dot after what you have just done,

161
0:08:41.400 --> 0:08:43.520
and it will just repeat the last action.

162
0:08:43.520 --> 0:08:47.160
So plus dot, it's like plus plus.

163
0:08:47.160 --> 0:08:50.560
Now, you can combine this with the number syntax.

164
0:08:50.560 --> 0:08:58.080
So if you prepend a number to the dot,

165
0:08:58.080 --> 0:09:00.560
the dot will repeat the last command,

166
0:09:00.560 --> 0:09:02.480
that number, that amount of times.

167
0:09:02.480 --> 0:09:05.880
So this can spare you a bit of typing interactively,

168
0:09:05.880 --> 0:09:10.120
but also in this special mode here.

169
0:09:10.120 --> 0:09:13.160
Of course, this just applies to the last command,

170
0:09:13.160 --> 0:09:16.560
not to the last combo or last series of things.

171
0:09:16.560 --> 0:09:20.200
For more complicated things,

172
0:09:20.200 --> 0:09:22.520
you can use another mechanism,

173
0:09:22.520 --> 0:09:28.000
which is that of simply configuring your VIMrc file,

174
0:09:28.000 --> 0:09:31.120
and there you perhaps bind

175
0:09:31.120 --> 0:09:35.400
a particular keyboard key to a special command.

176
0:09:35.400 --> 0:09:40.960
Then yes, you can use a repetition on that combo which you like,

177
0:09:40.960 --> 0:09:43.680
which is what is useful to you,

178
0:09:43.680 --> 0:09:47.400
and that's the way to go.

179
0:09:47.400 --> 0:09:50.600
So not over-complicate unnecessary things.

180
0:09:50.600 --> 0:09:54.480
Now, I will show random functionality which I like in VIM,

181
0:09:54.480 --> 0:09:57.960
or I didn't bother looking in other image viewers.

182
0:09:57.960 --> 0:10:00.320
So with the double apostrophe,

183
0:10:00.320 --> 0:10:05.640
I have the so-called shadow directory load, let's say.

184
0:10:05.640 --> 0:10:09.560
So my observation is that nowadays,

185
0:10:09.560 --> 0:10:11.640
cameras have a very high resolution.

186
0:10:11.640 --> 0:10:13.320
I don't need that resolution.

187
0:10:13.320 --> 0:10:14.760
Mostly, the pictures which come from

188
0:10:14.760 --> 0:10:17.600
those cameras are too heavy for my purposes.

189
0:10:17.600 --> 0:10:21.720
So what I do is that I have a directory with reductions,

190
0:10:21.720 --> 0:10:23.520
which fit more or less my screen,

191
0:10:23.520 --> 0:10:25.200
and I have another directory with

192
0:10:25.200 --> 0:10:27.760
the heavy image original pictures.

193
0:10:27.760 --> 0:10:29.720
But with VIM, I just say,

194
0:10:29.720 --> 0:10:33.200
hey VIM, in that directory are the originals,

195
0:10:33.200 --> 0:10:35.800
the heavy originals. So be aware of this.

196
0:10:35.800 --> 0:10:39.720
Then VIM offers me the double apostrophe,

197
0:10:39.720 --> 0:10:41.640
the double quote key,

198
0:10:41.640 --> 0:10:43.520
which does something which I forgot what it is,

199
0:10:43.520 --> 0:10:45.800
but you can just check it up with the help.

200
0:10:45.800 --> 0:10:49.440
That will substitute the content of the images,

201
0:10:49.440 --> 0:10:54.000
of the current images with image with a high resolution,

202
0:10:54.000 --> 0:10:57.120
or low resolution, or whatever you have set it up.

203
0:10:57.120 --> 0:10:58.400
So it's a way to substitute it.

204
0:10:58.400 --> 0:11:01.680
Probably, you can use it to create funny games or whatever,

205
0:11:01.680 --> 0:11:05.200
but for me, it's just the purpose of substituting

206
0:11:05.760 --> 0:11:09.720
the low resolution image with the high resolution image.

207
0:11:09.720 --> 0:11:11.760
Because I like using used computers.

208
0:11:11.760 --> 0:11:13.840
I think there's too much garbage on this earth,

209
0:11:13.840 --> 0:11:15.840
and therefore, sometimes I don't need

210
0:11:15.840 --> 0:11:19.840
that extra heavy processing in my everyday usage.

211
0:11:19.840 --> 0:11:21.640
I think this can help many users.

212
0:11:21.640 --> 0:11:26.440
Another thing which is perhaps unique maybe,

213
0:11:26.440 --> 0:11:29.680
it's a simple key to jump

214
0:11:29.680 --> 0:11:32.880
between the last view and the current view.

215
0:11:32.880 --> 0:11:36.720
Why? Because sometimes I watched 100 pictures,

216
0:11:36.720 --> 0:11:39.840
I do a selection of the few pictures I really like,

217
0:11:39.840 --> 0:11:42.200
and I jump between them because I want to see

218
0:11:42.200 --> 0:11:45.240
certain detail from one side, from the other side.

219
0:11:45.240 --> 0:11:47.960
So I like to jump a lot of times between two pictures,

220
0:11:47.960 --> 0:11:50.080
perhaps to catch some detail,

221
0:11:50.080 --> 0:11:54.440
and therefore, I have this key which most of the times,

222
0:11:54.440 --> 0:11:59.400
I would say retains the position you were and the scaling.

223
0:11:59.400 --> 0:12:01.120
So it's really for comparing things.

224
0:12:01.120 --> 0:12:03.320
I find it useful, especially in combination,

225
0:12:03.320 --> 0:12:05.760
as I said, with the short listing functionality

226
0:12:05.760 --> 0:12:09.320
which allows you to make selections.

227
0:12:09.320 --> 0:12:12.080
To shorten the selection of pictures.

228
0:12:12.080 --> 0:12:14.480
Now, another random functionality

229
0:12:14.480 --> 0:12:16.200
is the one of conversion pipelines.

230
0:12:16.200 --> 0:12:19.360
Sometimes you want to load things which are not

231
0:12:19.360 --> 0:12:24.800
properly pixel images like SVG files or PDFs or post-clip files.

232
0:12:24.800 --> 0:12:28.440
There are a few built-in defaults in

233
0:12:28.440 --> 0:12:32.040
theme which will invoke that external program

234
0:12:32.040 --> 0:12:35.400
to convert it in something that theme can view.

235
0:12:35.400 --> 0:12:38.200
So this enlarges the set of

236
0:12:38.200 --> 0:12:41.200
the picture formats which you can watch under theme.

237
0:12:41.200 --> 0:12:45.000
Extending this idea, perhaps sometimes you want to view

238
0:12:45.000 --> 0:12:47.400
all of the images which you are about to load

239
0:12:47.400 --> 0:12:50.080
with one specific filter pipeline.

240
0:12:50.080 --> 0:12:53.920
Here I have shown convert with charcoal filter and

241
0:12:53.920 --> 0:12:58.040
put a label on the bottom.

242
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:00.840
Yeah, you can specify that to theme when you start it,

243
0:13:00.840 --> 0:13:02.840
and all of the pictures which you will see in

244
0:13:02.840 --> 0:13:06.800
that session will be filtered according that way.

245
0:13:06.800 --> 0:13:08.840
I don't know what this is useful for.

246
0:13:08.840 --> 0:13:13.000
Previews, making fun, you choose it.

247
0:13:13.000 --> 0:13:16.960
But the point is, if you don't screw up this expression,

248
0:13:16.960 --> 0:13:18.800
you will not write to any file,

249
0:13:18.800 --> 0:13:22.720
so just temporary files will be modified.

250
0:13:22.720 --> 0:13:26.160
You can interact with different programs in different situations.

251
0:13:26.160 --> 0:13:31.720
Sometimes you can use the exclamation point syntax to call

252
0:13:31.720 --> 0:13:33.640
an external program and then we

253
0:13:33.640 --> 0:13:36.120
have external program that gets its output.

254
0:13:36.120 --> 0:13:37.640
Okay, it's not that useful.

255
0:13:37.640 --> 0:13:42.400
But still, if you go the dangerous way,

256
0:13:42.400 --> 0:13:45.720
you are not afraid, you create an alias which maybe

257
0:13:45.720 --> 0:13:49.640
calls in the end ExifTool and you say ExifTool,

258
0:13:49.640 --> 0:13:54.600
please remove the ExifData from the file which I'm just watching,

259
0:13:54.600 --> 0:14:00.160
because you can specify that file as an internal variable.

260
0:14:00.160 --> 0:14:03.320
Yes, you will modify the current file, which is dangerous.

261
0:14:03.320 --> 0:14:05.480
You should not do it, but if you really want and you are

262
0:14:05.480 --> 0:14:08.800
automating some nice useful workflow, you can do it.

263
0:14:08.800 --> 0:14:11.200
I have warned you. Okay.

264
0:14:11.200 --> 0:14:12.600
Did you know that with film,

265
0:14:12.600 --> 0:14:16.640
you can even load files from a file name list?

266
0:14:16.640 --> 0:14:18.840
Okay, this sounds boring.

267
0:14:18.840 --> 0:14:23.200
Sounds boring, but maybe it's nicer if you learn that with film,

268
0:14:23.200 --> 0:14:27.160
you can write files with the file name and the description.

269
0:14:27.160 --> 0:14:30.000
Okay, maybe it could be even useful in a few situations.

270
0:14:30.000 --> 0:14:33.040
In my case, I find it useful or I like it

271
0:14:33.040 --> 0:14:36.960
because film has a few captions in

272
0:14:36.960 --> 0:14:40.840
different parts of the displayed window, let's say.

273
0:14:40.840 --> 0:14:46.160
There are a few variables with expando codes,

274
0:14:46.160 --> 0:14:48.640
so like percentage and something.

275
0:14:48.640 --> 0:14:50.200
So you can customize them.

276
0:14:50.200 --> 0:14:51.600
You can view, I don't know,

277
0:14:51.600 --> 0:14:55.400
the comment which are the description which I said before,

278
0:14:55.400 --> 0:14:56.520
or other information.

279
0:14:56.520 --> 0:14:59.840
So you can customize it a bit the way you want it.

280
0:14:59.840 --> 0:15:04.400
More, you can have in this description file,

281
0:15:04.400 --> 0:15:07.720
internal variables. So just for the purpose of giving

282
0:15:07.720 --> 0:15:12.000
attributes to the files you're about to have in the list.

283
0:15:12.000 --> 0:15:14.280
So not only the descriptions, but also attributes.

284
0:15:14.280 --> 0:15:17.720
So the bill will be in the category businessman.

285
0:15:17.720 --> 0:15:21.200
Arun as best, the Brahmin Richard will be in the category activist.

286
0:15:21.200 --> 0:15:29.400
So they will inherit this, those attributes.

287
0:15:29.400 --> 0:15:33.760
Furthermore, there are some shortcut syntaxes

288
0:15:33.760 --> 0:15:37.720
which prepend text to this description,

289
0:15:37.720 --> 0:15:42.160
or allow referring to specific variables in

290
0:15:42.160 --> 0:15:46.320
those descriptions for the purpose of making them shorter.

291
0:15:46.320 --> 0:15:48.960
What you can use it for apart from the caption.

292
0:15:48.960 --> 0:15:51.160
Well, you can use them also for searching

293
0:15:51.160 --> 0:15:54.280
the picture in the file list.

294
0:15:54.280 --> 0:15:57.520
So with the go to command,

295
0:15:57.520 --> 0:16:02.520
or you use a special slash or question mark syntax,

296
0:16:02.520 --> 0:16:05.560
not command line, but search line,

297
0:16:05.560 --> 0:16:09.840
to search and to jump directly to a file which has a description that way.

298
0:16:09.840 --> 0:16:15.040
So if you manage your picture's collection nicely, it can be useful.

299
0:16:15.040 --> 0:16:17.000
For me, it's nice because I have my picture

300
0:16:17.000 --> 0:16:19.720
targeted that way and I'm happy with that.

301
0:16:19.720 --> 0:16:24.800
Or I have custom collections of pictures that way for my own amusement.

302
0:16:24.800 --> 0:16:28.280
Yes. So you have this go to command,

303
0:16:28.280 --> 0:16:33.600
which you can use also in other ways like jumping or controlling it to jump

304
0:16:33.600 --> 0:16:41.840
according to the values of those property variables.

305
0:16:41.840 --> 0:16:46.320
Or you can use this go to jump between to the next directory for instance.

306
0:16:46.320 --> 0:16:50.720
If you load like 1,000 files in different directories where they are,

307
0:16:50.720 --> 0:16:53.600
you can use go to and something very specific,

308
0:16:53.600 --> 0:16:55.240
which you find in the manual,

309
0:16:55.240 --> 0:17:00.200
and this will jump to the next directory inside what is being loaded there.

310
0:17:00.200 --> 0:17:02.200
So there are many shortcuts, let's say,

311
0:17:02.200 --> 0:17:06.360
for doing very specific jumps according to your workflow,

312
0:17:06.360 --> 0:17:09.800
because this is to adapt the way you wish to organize your stuff.

313
0:17:09.800 --> 0:17:13.080
Of course, if you have different specifications to the go to command,

314
0:17:13.080 --> 0:17:17.400
the first one which matches the jump will do the jump.

315
0:17:17.400 --> 0:17:20.320
Before the session is over,

316
0:17:20.320 --> 0:17:22.800
I wish to say the limit functionality,

317
0:17:22.800 --> 0:17:24.840
which I took from Matt.

318
0:17:24.840 --> 0:17:29.240
I find it also useful because you can shrink the collection.

319
0:17:29.240 --> 0:17:33.640
For instance, I have around 20,000 pictures in my photograph collections,

320
0:17:33.640 --> 0:17:37.360
but I can limit them for instance to city equal Brussels

321
0:17:37.360 --> 0:17:40.200
or something like this which is useful to me.

322
0:17:40.200 --> 0:17:45.800
In this case, you see that we have shortened the pictures list from the five,

323
0:17:45.800 --> 0:17:47.840
total five to four,

324
0:17:47.840 --> 0:17:50.680
which matches category equal activist.

325
0:17:50.680 --> 0:17:54.600
Yeah, further, the limit command can do shrink the list

326
0:17:54.600 --> 0:17:59.320
according to duplicate the base file names or the date of the files

327
0:17:59.320 --> 0:18:02.200
or the size of the files.

328
0:18:02.200 --> 0:18:06.360
The base idea of film is that you use it interactively.

329
0:18:06.360 --> 0:18:10.200
You have a few alliances which you perhaps sometimes customize

330
0:18:10.200 --> 0:18:15.040
and assign to specific keys which you like to have.

331
0:18:15.040 --> 0:18:17.880
Yeah, and you write this in the configuration file

332
0:18:17.880 --> 0:18:19.720
and you perhaps share it with others.

333
0:18:19.720 --> 0:18:25.320
You just remember by heart the commands which you use every day.

334
0:18:25.320 --> 0:18:28.000
That's all. So, film at the moment,

335
0:18:28.000 --> 0:18:31.080
I will be releasing the 06 after 15 years,

336
0:18:31.080 --> 0:18:34.120
the 06 version in a few days.

337
0:18:34.120 --> 0:18:36.320
The tarball is out there.

338
0:18:36.320 --> 0:18:40.560
I have to do some promotion and especially I have to say,

339
0:18:40.560 --> 0:18:43.080
give the next version to the Debian guys.

340
0:18:43.080 --> 0:18:46.040
So, there is the version on Debian and everywhere else is old,

341
0:18:46.040 --> 0:18:48.680
but we'll update it soon.

342
0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:52.120
The manual has everything, so everything is written there.

343
0:18:52.120 --> 0:18:55.680
And I hope you enjoy film and perhaps watch the other recording

344
0:18:55.680 --> 0:18:58.440
with more nerdy language aspects.

345
0:18:58.440 --> 0:19:01.040
That's all. Thank you for your attention.

346
0:19:06.040 --> 0:19:07.800
Hello, Ernie.

347
0:19:07.800 --> 0:19:10.600
So, we have some time for questions.

348
0:19:10.600 --> 0:19:13.120
Is there any questions on the floor?

349
0:19:13.120 --> 0:19:17.560
Yeah, so, the collection stuff sounds particularly interesting.

350
0:19:17.560 --> 0:19:19.960
Can you update the collection from film itself?

351
0:19:19.960 --> 0:19:23.080
So, while you're watching it, you'll tag an image so that

352
0:19:23.080 --> 0:19:26.000
while you're watching images, you will update your collection

353
0:19:26.000 --> 0:19:28.200
from within film somehow?

354
0:19:28.200 --> 0:19:29.840
Perhaps. At the moment, I don't have this.

355
0:19:29.840 --> 0:19:31.440
You've write a text file in your...

356
0:19:31.440 --> 0:19:33.000
I'll take a question because they don't hear.

357
0:19:33.000 --> 0:19:35.920
The question was whether film, as I have written,

358
0:19:35.920 --> 0:19:37.760
organised a picture, organised a...

359
0:19:37.760 --> 0:19:39.480
I wrote it correctly. No, I wrote a...

360
0:19:39.480 --> 0:19:41.760
It was a mistake. Film is not an organised.

361
0:19:41.760 --> 0:19:46.040
You have to organise the files by yourself with a text editor.

362
0:19:46.040 --> 0:19:50.040
We have a non-line question here, if you can read it.

363
0:19:50.040 --> 0:19:51.320
Thank you for the talk.

364
0:19:51.320 --> 0:19:54.080
Is there a way, plan, to have a way for film to script

365
0:19:54.080 --> 0:19:57.120
a small step-by-step animation of the actions?

366
0:19:57.120 --> 0:19:59.200
Maybe some sort of slip between the actions.

367
0:19:59.200 --> 0:20:03.040
Yes, there is a functionality which is called...

368
0:20:03.040 --> 0:20:05.080
recording out or something like this.

369
0:20:05.080 --> 0:20:09.560
So, after you exit film on the stand-aloud,

370
0:20:09.560 --> 0:20:12.640
in a specific file,

371
0:20:12.640 --> 0:20:14.400
actions and commands...

372
0:20:14.400 --> 0:20:16.520
Sorry, and timings will be speeded out.

373
0:20:16.520 --> 0:20:20.840
So, there is a slip command which says slip, I don't know,

374
0:20:20.840 --> 0:20:23.200
three quarters of a second, something like this.

375
0:20:23.200 --> 0:20:25.720
Yes, there are three... Yes.

376
0:20:25.720 --> 0:20:27.320
Question on the floor?

377
0:20:27.320 --> 0:20:29.480
Yeah, good question.

378
0:20:29.480 --> 0:20:31.320
What about the descriptions?

379
0:20:31.320 --> 0:20:33.800
Are stored in the same image file?

380
0:20:33.800 --> 0:20:36.560
Are they stored like metadata in the files?

381
0:20:36.560 --> 0:20:39.640
Can they be read by exit tools?

382
0:20:39.640 --> 0:20:42.480
What I have shown here was just the plain things

383
0:20:42.480 --> 0:20:44.600
you write in a textual file.

384
0:20:44.600 --> 0:20:45.920
So, yeah, it takes the...

385
0:20:45.920 --> 0:20:49.640
Apart from this, the exit tags from JPEGs,

386
0:20:49.640 --> 0:20:51.800
or I don't know, I think in other places also you have

387
0:20:51.800 --> 0:20:54.400
exit data, but at least for JPEGs, are being read

388
0:20:54.400 --> 0:20:58.360
and they become internal variables in set film

389
0:20:58.360 --> 0:21:01.480
because I really like to have some particular JPEG

390
0:21:01.480 --> 0:21:03.360
exit data being displayed in the caption

391
0:21:03.360 --> 0:21:04.640
and that occurs there.

392
0:21:04.640 --> 0:21:06.800
Actually, also PNGs and also JPEGs

393
0:21:06.800 --> 0:21:08.560
without exit have commands.

394
0:21:08.560 --> 0:21:10.560
This also drift here.

395
0:21:10.560 --> 0:21:12.200
Yeah, so there are different...

396
0:21:12.200 --> 0:21:14.440
I don't think I'm covering everything, everything, everything,

397
0:21:14.440 --> 0:21:18.520
but as soon as I learn of some extra metadata,

398
0:21:18.520 --> 0:21:23.000
I integrate it into internal variables

399
0:21:23.000 --> 0:21:25.160
associated to each file.

400
0:21:25.160 --> 0:21:27.520
I have one extra slide.

401
0:21:27.520 --> 0:21:29.840
Any other question maybe?

402
0:21:29.840 --> 0:21:33.240
Maybe I didn't have an understanding so much.

403
0:21:33.240 --> 0:21:39.800
The result of modifying this file is...

404
0:21:39.800 --> 0:21:40.960
Modifying which file?

405
0:21:40.960 --> 0:21:43.720
The original file.

406
0:21:43.720 --> 0:21:46.160
Is there still another file?

407
0:21:46.160 --> 0:21:48.200
We don't modify any file with film.

408
0:21:48.200 --> 0:21:50.520
If you do it, it's a mistake.

409
0:21:50.520 --> 0:21:53.040
Ah, OK.

410
0:21:53.040 --> 0:21:55.400
There was one example where I was saying

411
0:21:55.400 --> 0:21:59.400
you can write programs to modify the file,

412
0:21:59.400 --> 0:22:01.600
but most of the times you don't want this.

413
0:22:01.600 --> 0:22:04.920
But if you really want it, you can.

414
0:22:04.920 --> 0:22:08.320
If the file is changed on disk, will film reload it

415
0:22:08.320 --> 0:22:09.800
automatically or will it...

416
0:22:09.800 --> 0:22:11.720
I think there is such a functionality.

417
0:22:11.720 --> 0:22:17.040
Maybe the question is, if you are stuck on a picture

418
0:22:17.040 --> 0:22:20.600
and the picture changes, will the film reload it?

419
0:22:24.160 --> 0:22:25.920
There is some functionality to detect this.

420
0:22:25.920 --> 0:22:28.080
I'm not sure if at the moment it's at default.

421
0:22:28.080 --> 0:22:31.120
In principle, it's like two lines of code.

422
0:22:31.120 --> 0:22:32.760
It's easy to implement this.

423
0:22:32.760 --> 0:22:35.840
I think this is for picture frame situations

424
0:22:35.840 --> 0:22:38.120
where many people use film for picture frames.

425
0:22:38.120 --> 0:22:39.160
I'm not happy with that.

426
0:22:39.160 --> 0:22:41.120
I wish people to use it interactively.

427
0:22:41.120 --> 0:22:43.760
But yes, that's possible.

428
0:22:43.760 --> 0:22:47.080
If you want, I have one extra slide.

429
0:22:47.080 --> 0:22:51.240
So with film, you can even play the little

430
0:22:51.240 --> 0:22:54.480
steganographer or the little forensic investigator

431
0:22:54.480 --> 0:23:00.840
by using the offset switch or the seek magic

432
0:23:00.840 --> 0:23:04.160
internal variable, which do nothing else and saying,

433
0:23:04.160 --> 0:23:08.680
hey, please, don't seek for the image at byte zero.

434
0:23:08.680 --> 0:23:12.560
Between here and here, the picture is there in the file.

435
0:23:12.560 --> 0:23:16.360
So you can use this for looking for the signatures

436
0:23:16.360 --> 0:23:19.240
within the file, which maybe is broken.

437
0:23:19.240 --> 0:23:20.960
Maybe there are a few files which we

438
0:23:20.960 --> 0:23:22.440
concatenate for some reasons.

439
0:23:22.440 --> 0:23:26.080
Maybe it's a tar archive, which actually...

440
0:23:26.080 --> 0:23:26.800
Sorry?

441
0:23:26.800 --> 0:23:28.960
I have an example of this.

442
0:23:28.960 --> 0:23:35.640
So if you look at your Chrome cache, Chrome browser cache,

443
0:23:35.640 --> 0:23:40.080
you have binary files which are a concatenation of HTTP

444
0:23:40.080 --> 0:23:42.680
headers and image file.

445
0:23:42.680 --> 0:23:45.520
And right now, I'm using X-T2 to find the byte offset

446
0:23:45.520 --> 0:23:49.240
and then using image file.

447
0:23:49.240 --> 0:23:51.600
I would try it being the...

448
0:23:51.600 --> 0:23:53.000
Yeah, so film is...

449
0:23:53.000 --> 0:23:55.360
It's the same thing.

450
0:23:55.360 --> 0:24:01.480
So the question is, the observation is actually,

451
0:24:01.480 --> 0:24:06.480
apart from maybe seeking into broken file systems that way,

452
0:24:06.480 --> 0:24:09.640
you can even just look into the certain configuration files,

453
0:24:09.640 --> 0:24:12.680
so certain cache files, like the one from the Chrome browser,

454
0:24:12.680 --> 0:24:15.720
because there actually, there are some special custom file

455
0:24:15.720 --> 0:24:21.320
formats where a proper file is pushed down into another file.

456
0:24:21.320 --> 0:24:23.080
Yeah, the image has an HTTP response

457
0:24:23.080 --> 0:24:24.720
address in the same file.

458
0:24:24.720 --> 0:24:28.400
Yeah, there are encodings, let's say, which simply,

459
0:24:28.400 --> 0:24:30.560
you have a picture, but it's not immediately,

460
0:24:30.560 --> 0:24:32.120
cannot be immediately seen.

461
0:24:32.120 --> 0:24:35.320
But with this, you can, with functionality which jumps or

462
0:24:35.320 --> 0:24:41.600
seeks, looks for a file, perhaps with a signature can locate it.

463
0:24:41.600 --> 0:24:42.600
Yeah.

464
0:24:42.600 --> 0:24:44.160
Okay, the last question.

465
0:24:44.160 --> 0:24:46.800
We don't have any online.

466
0:24:46.800 --> 0:24:48.720
Question on the floor, yeah?

467
0:24:48.720 --> 0:24:49.800
On the left?

468
0:24:49.800 --> 0:24:52.080
No? Okay.

469
0:24:52.080 --> 0:24:53.600
Okay, thank you, Mikaelle.

470
0:24:53.600 --> 0:25:00.600
Thank you.
