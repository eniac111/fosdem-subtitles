1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.240
I'll introduce you.

2
0:00:06.240 --> 0:00:10.000
Kiran, are you ready?

3
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:11.000
Okay.

4
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:16.600
So we continue with our next talk.

5
0:00:16.600 --> 0:00:19.520
Sorry for all the technical problems we have today.

6
0:00:19.520 --> 0:00:24.080
Our next talk is by Michael Dobrich about modern camera handling in Chromium.

7
0:00:24.080 --> 0:00:26.120
We need to move a bit.

8
0:00:26.120 --> 0:00:27.120
Okay.

9
0:00:27.120 --> 0:00:28.120
Okay.

10
0:00:28.120 --> 0:00:29.120
Thank you.

11
0:00:29.120 --> 0:00:30.120
Thank you.

12
0:00:30.120 --> 0:00:39.600
So I'll talk a bit about camera handling in Chromium.

13
0:00:39.600 --> 0:00:43.440
I think Wim already teeshared some of the things at the end of his talk.

14
0:00:43.440 --> 0:00:49.160
So you'll notice similarities or reoccurring things that you already mentioned.

15
0:00:49.160 --> 0:00:53.320
But I'm going to dive deeper into how this actually works and the implementation, how

16
0:00:53.320 --> 0:00:56.680
we got to where we are now, and what's still missing.

17
0:00:56.680 --> 0:00:57.680
Okay.

18
0:00:57.680 --> 0:00:59.680
So let's start a short bit above me.

19
0:00:59.680 --> 0:01:03.040
I'm Michael Dobrich and I work for Pangotronics.

20
0:01:03.040 --> 0:01:06.280
I'm an embedded developer, Linux embedded developer.

21
0:01:06.280 --> 0:01:11.120
They're mostly doing graphics kind of things and these stuff.

22
0:01:11.120 --> 0:01:12.520
Okay.

23
0:01:12.520 --> 0:01:19.040
So what's right now in Chromium is basically video for Linux.

24
0:01:19.040 --> 0:01:22.680
Anyone who doesn't know what video for Linux is here in the room?

25
0:01:22.680 --> 0:01:23.680
A few people.

26
0:01:23.680 --> 0:01:24.680
Okay.

27
0:01:24.680 --> 0:01:25.680
Just a few words.

28
0:01:25.680 --> 0:01:30.760
So I'm going to use the kernel API to talk to cameras or add our devices too, but in

29
0:01:30.760 --> 0:01:35.240
this interesting here is camera.

30
0:01:35.240 --> 0:01:40.920
It's relatively simple API, just watch the format and give me a frame.

31
0:01:40.920 --> 0:01:47.000
And if you look at the Chromium code, it's, I'd say, well, there's little development,

32
0:01:47.000 --> 0:01:48.000
but it's basically done.

33
0:01:48.000 --> 0:01:52.560
We'll get to that information a bit later because that's why I'm mentioning it.

34
0:01:52.560 --> 0:01:58.120
I mean, the camera, the API is stable, it hasn't changed a lot, then the camera is working

35
0:01:58.120 --> 0:02:05.560
in the browser, so there's not much to do to change that.

36
0:02:05.560 --> 0:02:10.960
And then I started with a project where I wanted to do a bit more with cameras on a

37
0:02:10.960 --> 0:02:11.960
Linux system.

38
0:02:11.960 --> 0:02:17.440
It was a more less embedded device and the first thing was we want to choose if an application

39
0:02:17.440 --> 0:02:22.080
can use a camera and which camera it's supposed to use or allowed to use.

40
0:02:22.080 --> 0:02:26.200
And that's currently not possible because Chromium directly talks with the kernel and

41
0:02:26.200 --> 0:02:28.960
just picks the camera, right?

42
0:02:28.960 --> 0:02:38.960
And then there were web pages that didn't have the new API to do screen sharing.

43
0:02:38.960 --> 0:02:41.000
They didn't use that.

44
0:02:41.000 --> 0:02:46.600
So we wanted to basically pipe in the screen as a camera into this web page.

45
0:02:46.600 --> 0:02:53.800
That was mostly in the early days of the video conferencing kind of things and more the commercial

46
0:02:53.800 --> 0:02:57.760
applications that they had their products ready and done and didn't want to implement

47
0:02:57.760 --> 0:02:59.400
new kind of things.

48
0:02:59.400 --> 0:03:03.000
It's getting less, but it's still some of the muscle out there.

49
0:03:03.000 --> 0:03:08.800
And then there were some cameras that were only H.264 and that's not supported by, I

50
0:03:08.800 --> 0:03:16.320
don't think any browser on Linux actually can handle H.264 only cameras in the browser.

51
0:03:16.320 --> 0:03:18.900
And then I wanted to attach IP cameras.

52
0:03:18.900 --> 0:03:25.760
So I have the camera maybe back there in the room and I want to use that for a camera in

53
0:03:25.760 --> 0:03:26.760
a video conference call.

54
0:03:26.760 --> 0:03:31.760
If you have a bigger room and they don't want to use a long USB cable, their network would

55
0:03:31.760 --> 0:03:37.760
be ideal, but I can't attach an IP camera to video for Linux, right?

56
0:03:37.760 --> 0:03:41.200
So that's why we're shading.

57
0:03:41.200 --> 0:03:44.320
These are not exactly common use cases.

58
0:03:44.320 --> 0:03:50.640
I was looking for something I could argue, what can I do to bring this to Chromium mainline?

59
0:03:50.640 --> 0:04:00.160
So if I want to implement something there, I need something what's more, yeah, an excuse

60
0:04:00.160 --> 0:04:04.880
exactly to say this is useful for other people too.

61
0:04:04.880 --> 0:04:11.120
So I started looking and the first thing that I came across then was because I was also

62
0:04:11.120 --> 0:04:18.480
looking at or had used the screen sharing part which works with the portal kind of things

63
0:04:18.480 --> 0:04:19.920
and in containers.

64
0:04:19.920 --> 0:04:23.800
That's what my first use case, what I said, hey, these kind of people and that's what

65
0:04:23.800 --> 0:04:30.060
them mentioned earlier as well is we want to say who's allowed to use the camera.

66
0:04:30.060 --> 0:04:35.400
And that was one use case I had in mind to say, hey, we need a new high level API, we

67
0:04:35.400 --> 0:04:41.080
need an API where we can say outside of the browser if the browser is allowed to use the

68
0:04:41.080 --> 0:04:42.720
camera.

69
0:04:42.720 --> 0:04:47.400
And then while I was already implementing these kind of things, actually the camera stuff

70
0:04:47.400 --> 0:04:48.400
came up.

71
0:04:48.400 --> 0:04:53.680
Then also mentioned that in this talk that we have new ways to talk to cameras and there

72
0:04:53.680 --> 0:05:01.520
was no backend in Chromium there and so the idea was to promote and say, hey, let's use

73
0:05:01.520 --> 0:05:08.160
this shared high level API for the browsers and just plug in the camera at the backend

74
0:05:08.160 --> 0:05:15.400
which by the way is already implemented because, yeah, I'll get to that in a second.

75
0:05:15.400 --> 0:05:21.880
So we want to do the authorization kind of thing and we want to do high level API so

76
0:05:21.880 --> 0:05:25.200
we can put something else in behind.

77
0:05:25.200 --> 0:05:27.440
And the solution was already there.

78
0:05:27.440 --> 0:05:32.560
As soon as I really started looking it was obvious because the XG desktop portal kind

79
0:05:32.560 --> 0:05:37.160
of thing that's the portal stuff that Wim mentioned, it already had an API for camera.

80
0:05:37.160 --> 0:05:40.320
It was basically not used I think.

81
0:05:40.320 --> 0:05:47.680
I didn't find any real life implementations that used it in the common case but it was

82
0:05:47.680 --> 0:05:49.360
already there.

83
0:05:49.360 --> 0:05:52.520
And so I said, okay, let's do that.

84
0:05:52.520 --> 0:05:57.000
And I already was involved with pipewire and used it for the screen sharing kind of thing.

85
0:05:57.000 --> 0:05:59.560
So nothing new to me.

86
0:05:59.560 --> 0:06:03.200
I said, okay, let's implement that.

87
0:06:03.200 --> 0:06:06.360
And I started to implement.

88
0:06:06.360 --> 0:06:12.120
But before that I want to say a bit about how it works.

89
0:06:12.120 --> 0:06:18.120
So the browser needs to talk to the portal and say, hey, I access camera.

90
0:06:18.120 --> 0:06:23.200
That's basically the API call to the portal and say, hey, I want to access the camera.

91
0:06:23.200 --> 0:06:24.920
Am I allowed to do that?

92
0:06:24.920 --> 0:06:25.920
Okay.

93
0:06:25.920 --> 0:06:28.360
Yeah, you're allowed to do that.

94
0:06:28.360 --> 0:06:29.360
Okay.

95
0:06:29.360 --> 0:06:30.360
Great.

96
0:06:30.360 --> 0:06:34.960
Then, well, yeah, I need this pipewire remote to basically create the connection to the

97
0:06:34.960 --> 0:06:37.560
pipewire and say, okay.

98
0:06:37.560 --> 0:06:41.360
And then the portal says, okay, pipewire connect.

99
0:06:41.360 --> 0:06:43.800
We want to talk to you.

100
0:06:43.800 --> 0:06:49.880
And what the portal is doing then is restricting access.

101
0:06:49.880 --> 0:06:57.000
So the browser won't have access to everything that's available on pipewire, but actually

102
0:06:57.000 --> 0:07:02.400
only the cameras because we're only allowed access to the cameras.

103
0:07:02.400 --> 0:07:08.840
There's a lot more details there in the background, but for the Chromium side for the implementation,

104
0:07:08.840 --> 0:07:10.920
we don't need to care about that.

105
0:07:10.920 --> 0:07:15.680
And then the portal hands over the file descriptor to Chromium and Chromium can talk to pipewire

106
0:07:15.680 --> 0:07:19.280
directly and access cameras.

107
0:07:19.280 --> 0:07:26.480
And then Chromium starts sending messages basically to pipewire and says, hey, we'll

108
0:07:26.480 --> 0:07:30.280
need the objects and then the objects show up and I need your properties for all the

109
0:07:30.280 --> 0:07:33.360
objects and basically builds up a list of cameras.

110
0:07:33.360 --> 0:07:38.640
But it takes several round trips between Chromium and pipewire to get to that list.

111
0:07:38.640 --> 0:07:43.680
That will be important again later as well because we're talking multiple processes here

112
0:07:43.680 --> 0:07:47.160
and so it can take a bit of time.

113
0:07:47.160 --> 0:07:52.120
And once we're there, the user selects a camera and says, okay, we want to start streaming,

114
0:07:52.120 --> 0:07:58.880
then we'll start streaming and pipewire sends video frames over to Chromium.

115
0:07:58.880 --> 0:08:02.920
That's basically the easy part at the end, although there is some format handling there

116
0:08:02.920 --> 0:08:04.840
involved as well.

117
0:08:04.840 --> 0:08:06.920
So okay, first try.

118
0:08:06.920 --> 0:08:10.080
I was a bit naive actually at that point.

119
0:08:10.080 --> 0:08:14.960
I started implementing this kind of thing that was basically two years ago and I had

120
0:08:14.960 --> 0:08:20.840
more or less pull requests and it's changed set, I think.

121
0:08:20.840 --> 0:08:25.120
It's changed list, CL, whatever.

122
0:08:25.120 --> 0:08:32.360
And well, I posted it, I had it ready for review and there was not a lot of review going

123
0:08:32.360 --> 0:08:33.360
on.

124
0:08:33.360 --> 0:08:38.960
But I'm not trying to blame anyone here, but as I said at the beginning, the camera

125
0:08:38.960 --> 0:08:40.840
stuff in Chromium was basically done.

126
0:08:40.840 --> 0:08:44.600
So there were not a lot of people working on that.

127
0:08:44.600 --> 0:08:51.680
So then you may be the Chromium camera API and video for Linux, but I had this new pipewire

128
0:08:51.680 --> 0:08:56.840
portal de-burst code in there and none of the developers were actually familiar with

129
0:08:56.840 --> 0:08:58.240
that kind of code.

130
0:08:58.240 --> 0:09:02.960
So it was slow going, there was mostly some high level review for how the integration

131
0:09:02.960 --> 0:09:03.960
worked.

132
0:09:03.960 --> 0:09:10.920
And then there were some issues with, okay, this is not just Chromium, this is also Google

133
0:09:10.920 --> 0:09:12.000
Chrome.

134
0:09:12.000 --> 0:09:18.040
And that's a binary build that's deployed on multiple platforms, so we cannot just link

135
0:09:18.040 --> 0:09:24.200
to the pipewire because it may not be there, so we need to load it dynamically.

136
0:09:24.200 --> 0:09:29.840
But WebRTC, and when I talk about WebRTC in this talk, I'm talking about the implementation

137
0:09:29.840 --> 0:09:37.760
used by the browsers, not the specification kind of things.

138
0:09:37.760 --> 0:09:43.920
So in WebRTC, the pipewire is also loaded dynamically for the screen sharing.

139
0:09:43.920 --> 0:09:48.240
That should have been the right flag for me, but I didn't notice at the time.

140
0:09:48.240 --> 0:09:51.400
So basically, WebRTC tried to load the pipewire.

141
0:09:51.400 --> 0:09:54.760
I tried to load the pipewire in Chromium and that clashed.

142
0:09:54.760 --> 0:09:58.720
There were just architectural problems to do both at the same time.

143
0:09:58.720 --> 0:10:04.520
And that's when we're stuck a bit and thinking about how to work around that issue and the

144
0:10:04.520 --> 0:10:10.440
merge request basically dissolved a bit, and then someone came on the platform, Yang Ruli,

145
0:10:10.440 --> 0:10:15.960
for example, and he was actually someone who knew about the pipewire stuff, about the portal

146
0:10:15.960 --> 0:10:22.000
stuff, and said, hey, well, we shouldn't do that in Chromium, we should do that in WebRTC.

147
0:10:22.000 --> 0:10:24.040
I said, okay, right.

148
0:10:24.040 --> 0:10:31.520
I was actually sitting down with them and with Jan and Mark Foltz and a video conference

149
0:10:31.520 --> 0:10:36.120
and we talked a bit about the architecture side and said, okay, WebRTC is the right place

150
0:10:36.120 --> 0:10:40.200
because if I put it in WebRTC, WebRTC is also used by Firefox.

151
0:10:40.200 --> 0:10:46.500
So Firefox can also use my implementation to do cameras.

152
0:10:46.500 --> 0:10:50.320
So second try, do it in WebRTC.

153
0:10:50.320 --> 0:10:56.460
There is already a camera API that's used by Firefox actually, and on Linux it just

154
0:10:56.460 --> 0:10:59.860
implements Visual Linux.

155
0:10:59.860 --> 0:11:07.720
So the idea was I put a back-end for pipewire in WebRTC and I put a back-end for WebRTC

156
0:11:07.720 --> 0:11:12.360
in Chromium, basically just an indirection.

157
0:11:12.360 --> 0:11:18.360
Yeah, there was an API, but there were some issues.

158
0:11:18.360 --> 0:11:28.040
I mean, it was an API designed for APIs like Visual for Linux, and if you enumerate devices

159
0:11:28.040 --> 0:11:31.360
in Visual for Linux, you can do that basically instantaneously.

160
0:11:31.360 --> 0:11:38.040
Just open a few file descriptors, send a few Iocals and you're done.

161
0:11:38.040 --> 0:11:43.280
So there was a synchronous call to give me all the cameras.

162
0:11:43.280 --> 0:11:50.080
And well, as I showed before, we need to talk to the portal.

163
0:11:50.080 --> 0:11:57.300
The portal may actually ask the user if the application is allowed to access the camera.

164
0:11:57.300 --> 0:12:04.400
And then we need to iterate over the devices found or the cameras found in pipewires.

165
0:12:04.400 --> 0:12:08.640
That's not something we can do in a synchronous function call in a browser.

166
0:12:08.640 --> 0:12:15.040
So I needed a new asynchronous API to do actually this enumeration.

167
0:12:15.040 --> 0:12:21.400
And then for the API was also here's the static function, give it a string as an argument

168
0:12:21.400 --> 0:12:26.120
to select the camera and open this camera for me.

169
0:12:26.120 --> 0:12:33.720
Same issue here, I need or similar issue related, I have this open connection to pipewire that

170
0:12:33.720 --> 0:12:37.480
I need to keep open to access the camera.

171
0:12:37.480 --> 0:12:42.060
Otherwise we would need to talk to the portal again, which doesn't make sense.

172
0:12:42.060 --> 0:12:46.840
So basically need some state from the carried over from the enumeration of the cameras to

173
0:12:46.840 --> 0:12:48.760
actually accessing the cameras.

174
0:12:48.760 --> 0:12:49.880
Wasn't there either?

175
0:12:49.880 --> 0:12:51.720
So needed new API.

176
0:12:51.720 --> 0:13:02.240
And on the other end of the API, the frames that came out of the stack were already converted

177
0:13:02.240 --> 0:13:09.760
to I for 20 some pixel format.

178
0:13:09.760 --> 0:13:11.720
And this included a copy.

179
0:13:11.720 --> 0:13:17.440
Basically WebRTC took the raw frame from the camera, converted or copied it to the new

180
0:13:17.440 --> 0:13:20.240
format and then handed the R to the browser.

181
0:13:20.240 --> 0:13:26.240
But gromium basically assumed that the camera would give it the raw frame from the camera,

182
0:13:26.240 --> 0:13:28.280
converted itself or copied it.

183
0:13:28.280 --> 0:13:32.360
So if I would use that API, which is basically have two copies.

184
0:13:32.360 --> 0:13:33.360
Wanted to avoid that.

185
0:13:33.360 --> 0:13:38.560
So I need a new API to access the raw frame from the browser.

186
0:13:38.560 --> 0:13:46.720
So suddenly my single merge request to just add the camera support to chromium grew a

187
0:13:46.720 --> 0:13:47.720
bit.

188
0:13:47.720 --> 0:13:50.720
So I'm going to add a little bit more than that.

189
0:13:50.720 --> 0:13:53.520
So right.

190
0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:59.720
And at the end of the day, I wanted to do this without causing any regressions.

191
0:13:59.720 --> 0:14:03.880
So the first step is we add a feature flag actually in chromium.

192
0:14:03.880 --> 0:14:09.920
So if you want to use that once it's merged, it will be disabled by default at first.

193
0:14:09.920 --> 0:14:14.600
So if you want to try it, you need to enable this feature flag and says we want to use

194
0:14:14.600 --> 0:14:16.600
pipe wire for cameras.

195
0:14:16.600 --> 0:14:22.720
Okay, if we look at that, then we go to the web RTC and ask the web RTC, hey, there is

196
0:14:22.720 --> 0:14:28.160
a software search basically built what's used by the implementation in chromium and says,

197
0:14:28.160 --> 0:14:29.360
okay, we want to use pipe wire.

198
0:14:29.360 --> 0:14:31.400
So that's why we're going here.

199
0:14:31.400 --> 0:14:34.360
There's also a video for Linux implementation.

200
0:14:34.360 --> 0:14:38.600
That's not used by chromium because chromium has its own video for Linux implementation.

201
0:14:38.600 --> 0:14:50.320
So this way, if we say pipe wire is not enabled, this is actually implemented for Firefox because

202
0:14:50.320 --> 0:14:58.320
we may want to disable the pipe wire stuff in the web RTC from the Firefox side of things

203
0:14:58.320 --> 0:15:04.680
if it's disabled there and then just go this route to the video for Linux implementation

204
0:15:04.680 --> 0:15:05.680
in web RTC.

205
0:15:05.680 --> 0:15:08.480
But that's not used in chromium.

206
0:15:08.480 --> 0:15:11.760
So we say, okay, pipe wire is enabled, so we go here.

207
0:15:11.760 --> 0:15:14.000
That port is the portal actually available.

208
0:15:14.000 --> 0:15:20.480
So we have a build from chromium and at some point enable it maybe always, but still the

209
0:15:20.480 --> 0:15:25.280
Linux system underneath may not have a portal implementation running.

210
0:15:25.280 --> 0:15:30.480
So if that fails, we need to go back, okay, video for Linux is disabled and then we fall

211
0:15:30.480 --> 0:15:35.400
back to the video for Linux implementation in chromium.

212
0:15:35.400 --> 0:15:40.920
And if it works, then we ask the user that may be cached or is often cached.

213
0:15:40.920 --> 0:15:44.680
So you won't see that more than once typically.

214
0:15:44.680 --> 0:15:49.560
But if the user says, yes, this chromium is allowed to use the camera, then we actually

215
0:15:49.560 --> 0:15:57.000
get access to the camera and here is where the pipe wire stuff actually starts.

216
0:15:57.000 --> 0:16:03.680
So you need to set the switch and then hopefully have a working portal set up and then you

217
0:16:03.680 --> 0:16:07.200
can use the camera this way.

218
0:16:07.200 --> 0:16:10.120
Okay, where are we?

219
0:16:10.120 --> 0:16:15.960
I mean, part of this talk is to raise a bit of awareness, maybe someone who can review

220
0:16:15.960 --> 0:16:19.920
more things or maybe add stuff later on.

221
0:16:19.920 --> 0:16:22.240
So let's talk about what's there.

222
0:16:22.240 --> 0:16:26.240
First commit was split-out generic portal pipe wire code.

223
0:16:26.240 --> 0:16:38.040
That was code used in the screen sharing for the portal that could also be used for camera

224
0:16:38.040 --> 0:16:40.260
sharing with the portal.

225
0:16:40.260 --> 0:16:43.760
So we put that in a place where it can be shared.

226
0:16:43.760 --> 0:16:45.520
Then the next part was the rawframe.

227
0:16:45.520 --> 0:16:48.520
I mentioned that earlier we don't want to do the double copy.

228
0:16:48.520 --> 0:16:51.600
That was basically adding a bit of new API.

229
0:16:51.600 --> 0:16:59.280
Then merged I think just two days ago is the actual pipe wire portal capture support within

230
0:16:59.280 --> 0:17:01.960
WebRTC.

231
0:17:01.960 --> 0:17:08.160
That was merged just a few days ago.

232
0:17:08.160 --> 0:17:13.760
So the WebRTC is mostly done.

233
0:17:13.760 --> 0:17:16.920
I'm not sure what Firefox will do.

234
0:17:16.920 --> 0:17:20.080
Basically it's ready for Firefox people to implement things in Firefox.

235
0:17:20.080 --> 0:17:22.440
So I don't know if someone was working on it.

236
0:17:22.440 --> 0:17:29.120
If not, maybe someone here is interested in that so they can do that part.

237
0:17:29.120 --> 0:17:36.640
There is basically just a small merge request left because all this camera kind of things

238
0:17:36.640 --> 0:17:41.080
in WebRTC is not actually built right now if we're building WebRTC for Chromium.

239
0:17:41.080 --> 0:17:46.360
So we need just to do an infrastructure a bit, build these files as well.

240
0:17:46.360 --> 0:17:48.980
That's all the WebRTC is designed.

241
0:17:48.980 --> 0:17:53.960
When we come to Chromium, and in Chromium there are two commits pending.

242
0:17:53.960 --> 0:17:55.360
None of them have been merged yet.

243
0:17:55.360 --> 0:18:01.600
The first is basically, well there is this Linux camera back end right now in Chromium,

244
0:18:01.600 --> 0:18:03.440
which is Vigifilinux back end.

245
0:18:03.440 --> 0:18:10.400
So basically rename it from Linux to Vigifilinux, place a switch in front of it.

246
0:18:10.400 --> 0:18:16.320
That's where this feature flag comes in where I say, okay, can we do a portal or not?

247
0:18:16.320 --> 0:18:21.440
We make space to put a separate back end there next to it.

248
0:18:21.440 --> 0:18:26.320
The second commit is the actual implementation.

249
0:18:26.320 --> 0:18:30.360
Once that's merged, then we actually have the full support.

250
0:18:30.360 --> 0:18:33.480
Hopefully that happens in the next few.

251
0:18:33.480 --> 0:18:39.280
Well, weeks is probably a bit optimistic, but months.

252
0:18:39.280 --> 0:18:41.320
Okay.

253
0:18:41.320 --> 0:18:42.480
What's next?

254
0:18:42.480 --> 0:18:48.840
So for me, I probably won't work on these things in the near future because this was

255
0:18:48.840 --> 0:18:53.760
done for a customer project and it's taken a long time and they're getting, well, they've

256
0:18:53.760 --> 0:18:55.000
been good support about this.

257
0:18:55.000 --> 0:18:59.680
So it's really, there was no complaining, but I do need to get on with other things.

258
0:18:59.680 --> 0:19:01.280
I haven't done this full time.

259
0:19:01.280 --> 0:19:06.280
This was always, I do a bit, then wait for revenue, then get some revenue.

260
0:19:06.280 --> 0:19:07.480
So these kind of things.

261
0:19:07.480 --> 0:19:12.920
But I need to get this finished up, but there are more features to come.

262
0:19:12.920 --> 0:19:16.360
There is some new XG Desktop portal device API.

263
0:19:16.360 --> 0:19:21.600
It was mentioned on one of my merge requests that there's some API stuff coming that's

264
0:19:21.600 --> 0:19:22.600
still not merged.

265
0:19:22.600 --> 0:19:28.640
There's some requests, but once that's in, the idea would be to support that to access

266
0:19:28.640 --> 0:19:30.480
cameras.

267
0:19:30.480 --> 0:19:39.920
And then there are some more features that Chromium supports for cameras like rotation

268
0:19:39.920 --> 0:19:43.400
that are not yet supported by the new backend.

269
0:19:43.400 --> 0:19:47.520
I'm not sure if the whole stack below that already supports all of it.

270
0:19:47.520 --> 0:19:50.920
I'm pretty sure that Pipewire does.

271
0:19:50.920 --> 0:19:53.420
I'm not quite certain, but I think so.

272
0:19:53.420 --> 0:19:59.880
There is API in WebRTC for rotation.

273
0:19:59.880 --> 0:20:03.240
So I think it mostly needs to be hooked up.

274
0:20:03.240 --> 0:20:10.040
So we can rotate the camera image from 90, 180 or 270 degrees.

275
0:20:10.040 --> 0:20:13.760
And then there are also features, basically if you know, with your for Linux, they have

276
0:20:13.760 --> 0:20:18.520
the controls to do panning, tilting, zooming, focus handling, whatever.

277
0:20:18.520 --> 0:20:26.160
And a few of those things are integrated in Chromium as basically image properties, I

278
0:20:26.160 --> 0:20:27.560
think.

279
0:20:27.560 --> 0:20:31.120
And they are hooked up in the for Linux backend.

280
0:20:31.120 --> 0:20:35.040
But I don't think there is an API in Pipewire to access that.

281
0:20:35.040 --> 0:20:36.120
I'm not quite sure.

282
0:20:36.120 --> 0:20:39.640
So maybe we need to add it to the whole stack.

283
0:20:39.640 --> 0:20:43.560
So there's some work to be done there as well.

284
0:20:43.560 --> 0:20:49.160
But my hope is that at some point that gets added and then we can really switch the Pipewire

285
0:20:49.160 --> 0:20:52.640
camera on as default in Chromium.

286
0:20:52.640 --> 0:20:56.520
Because I don't think it will be accepted as a default unless we have a more or less

287
0:20:56.520 --> 0:20:59.040
basic feature parity there.

288
0:20:59.040 --> 0:21:00.720
So still work to be done.

289
0:21:00.720 --> 0:21:06.280
So hopefully maybe someone got interested and will help out there.

290
0:21:06.280 --> 0:21:08.080
Okay.

291
0:21:08.080 --> 0:21:09.080
A few thanks.

292
0:21:09.080 --> 0:21:12.360
That's my customer who sponsored this work.

293
0:21:12.360 --> 0:21:15.080
So I'll put them here there.

294
0:21:15.080 --> 0:21:21.160
Jan Grulich and Mark Fols, they actually got the revenue started because once they got

295
0:21:21.160 --> 0:21:28.240
involved and noticed my patches, they found people that actually could press the necessary

296
0:21:28.240 --> 0:21:31.360
buttons on the review and say, okay, this is accepted.

297
0:21:31.360 --> 0:21:33.440
And they did a lot of review there.

298
0:21:33.440 --> 0:21:35.400
Talked to me about the architecture.

299
0:21:35.400 --> 0:21:39.360
So they helped me get on with it.

300
0:21:39.360 --> 0:21:45.240
And Ilya Adonkalani and Alex Cooper, they did a lot of review as well.

301
0:21:45.240 --> 0:21:48.720
And Kirian Bingham, he's doing a lot of the camera work.

302
0:21:48.720 --> 0:21:52.560
And my work actually last year on the ELC.

303
0:21:52.560 --> 0:21:59.080
But he's done a lot of testing because he's trying out his camera stuff in combination

304
0:21:59.080 --> 0:22:01.480
with the Chromium patches.

305
0:22:01.480 --> 0:22:03.920
So a lot of testing and review there as well.

306
0:22:03.920 --> 0:22:06.560
And probably a few more reviewers that I missed.

307
0:22:06.560 --> 0:22:09.000
I just went over the list.

308
0:22:09.000 --> 0:22:14.760
People that said something on the request went to the longest.

309
0:22:14.760 --> 0:22:18.840
Those seemed to be the most common here.

310
0:22:18.840 --> 0:22:19.840
Okay.

311
0:22:19.840 --> 0:22:23.480
I'm almost done, so I'll come to a question in a second.

312
0:22:23.480 --> 0:22:28.920
So yeah, like everybody we're hiring, all of our companies need good people.

313
0:22:28.920 --> 0:22:29.920
Okay.

314
0:22:29.920 --> 0:22:33.080
So thanks and questions.

315
0:22:33.080 --> 0:22:34.080
So I'll start with you.

316
0:22:34.080 --> 0:22:39.080
Yeah, just a comment that Kirian is going to give a talk on LibCamera in one hour in

317
0:22:39.080 --> 0:22:40.080
the 7-hour room.

318
0:22:40.080 --> 0:22:41.080
Yeah, okay.

319
0:22:41.080 --> 0:22:47.880
So we're giving a talk about LibCamera in which that embedded an automotive room.

320
0:22:47.880 --> 0:22:50.240
So maybe I'll be there.

321
0:22:50.240 --> 0:22:51.240
Exactly.

322
0:22:51.240 --> 0:22:53.520
So any other questions?

323
0:22:53.520 --> 0:22:54.520
Okay, here.

324
0:22:54.520 --> 0:22:58.520
I just want to comment on the discussion for all the bits.

325
0:22:58.520 --> 0:22:42.940
How do we need to keep an eye on the questions from the

326
0:22:42.940 --> 0:23:03.520
director of the webinar?

327
0:23:03.520 --> 0:23:06.680
I don't, if there's a page for all the bits.

328
0:23:06.680 --> 0:23:12.480
I don't have any web page or anything for that, but if you basically subscribe to the

329
0:23:12.480 --> 0:23:18.200
last one, that's the one where it gets interesting, right?

330
0:23:18.200 --> 0:23:20.200
Okay.

331
0:23:20.200 --> 0:23:23.200
Any other questions?

332
0:23:23.200 --> 0:23:25.200
Okay.

333
0:23:25.200 --> 0:23:39.640
And we're done.
