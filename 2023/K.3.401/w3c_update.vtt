WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
We'll show you five.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.400
And just shout if I'm running out of time.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.920
Well, everybody, thanks for coming out today.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.840
Where's the speaker?

00:17.840 --> 00:22.400
He's going to give us an update on W3C.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.400
I forgot to pick mine yesterday.

00:24.400 --> 00:32.600
Yeah, great.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.560
Hello, everyone.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.120
Hello, I'm going to start.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.760
So thank you for being here.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.240
I'm glad to open that dev room.

00:44.240 --> 00:49.520
It's my first time at Fuzz.dam, so I'm very happy to be here in front of you.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.800
And I ask you to be kind because I'm not used to present that much, right?

00:53.800 --> 00:57.120
And I'm open to feedback afterward.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.840
Just come and see me.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.760
Tell me how to improve.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.400
I would be very, very happy to hear you.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.880
Okay, my talk is about W3C.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.200
Do you know W3C?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.440
Who knows that?

01:10.440 --> 01:11.160
Raise your hand.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.640
Okay, that was an easy question for everybody to raise their hand, right?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.680
It's a worldwide organization.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.760
Everybody knows it.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.280
They define standards.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.600
And it's quite far from us, right?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.920
We don't know exactly what happened in that organization.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.600
There's big names and serious people around the table discussing things.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.960
And eventually, they agree on something that applies to the market.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.960
And they've got some working group, and there is one working group,

01:40.960 --> 01:43.920
which is about WebRTC.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.760
Okay, who works with WebRTC in the room?

01:47.760 --> 01:48.640
Okay, that's great.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.200
That was also an easy question in the room, real-time communication, right?

01:53.520 --> 01:57.240
So there is one working group that defined the standards for

01:57.240 --> 01:58.800
us on the market.

01:58.800 --> 02:05.200
So I thought that it was quite interesting to understand how it works and

02:05.200 --> 02:10.200
what are the topics, and maybe how to get involved into it so

02:10.200 --> 02:13.440
that the future is built by us, right?

02:13.440 --> 02:15.880
We are kind of part of the community.

02:15.880 --> 02:22.360
And the W3C is about getting the community to reach consensus.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.080
So it makes sense to be around the table.

02:25.080 --> 02:29.560
So in fact, first, I was interested to know more about that organization, and

02:29.560 --> 02:31.680
I think that it could be interesting for you too.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.480
By the way, I'm Romain.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.800
I work for a company, like everybody, right?

02:38.800 --> 02:45.720
And I'm a co-organizer at DevFest in my city.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.360
Sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's asleep.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.360
All right, be back.

02:51.400 --> 02:58.760
And I was so a co-organizer at a meetup that will soon revive,

02:58.760 --> 03:02.080
which is called the WebRTC Paris meetup, soon revive,

03:02.080 --> 03:05.560
because it's been asleep for a few months, a few years, in fact.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.120
And so connect with me if you want to talk about those topics, of course.

03:11.120 --> 03:16.200
You can reach me on Twitch every Thursday also.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.400
Right, so I talked about that.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.560
There was been a standard that enables all the industry to agree on a protocol.

03:24.560 --> 03:30.760
It's called the WebRTC standard, and it came only in 2021.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.600
So it's very late, in fact.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.200
If you are in the WebRTC industry for a while,

03:37.320 --> 03:40.760
you use that protocol quite for a long time.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.920
It's not, 2021 is not the beginning.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.640
It's kind of the end.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.080
So that's kind of what W3C is,

03:50.080 --> 03:54.080
is making sure that we agree on something stable.

03:54.080 --> 03:59.160
So from that moment, you can build on solid foundations,

03:59.160 --> 04:02.320
your applications using WebRTC.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.040
And that's why it's quite interesting.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.520
What is quite interesting also is that it's a corporate

04:08.520 --> 04:14.600
action across W3C and also IETF.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.240
So W3C, the usage of it,

04:20.240 --> 04:24.200
and the other organization is more about how you structure the protocol,

04:24.200 --> 04:30.560
the networking protocol that enable the thing to flow across the clients.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.760
So that's quite interesting to join force on that particular topic.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.520
So they need to agree together, like the working group at W3C

04:39.520 --> 04:44.440
need to agree also with the working group at the EETF.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.120
I don't know how to pronounce that anyway.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.880
So yeah, happy, we've got a standard.

04:49.880 --> 04:55.120
But in fact, there is a lot of use cases that are already on the market.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.920
So what is the working group doing?

04:59.920 --> 05:03.920
So that's work group, the WebRTC work group.

05:03.920 --> 05:09.800
They accept any individual to contribute or to participate.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.440
They also encourage anyone, any company,

05:13.440 --> 05:17.440
anyone, any company or any organization to become a member.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
All right.

05:18.440 --> 05:23.680
So as an organization, you might be an end user,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.360
I mean, sorry, a company that build a solution based on that protocol,

05:27.360 --> 05:32.040
or you can be also a browser editor, for example.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.720
You can propose new standards.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.840
So that's quite powerful if you're a member, you can propose new standards.

05:38.840 --> 05:45.480
And as it's based on consensus, if your proposal is a need on the market,

05:45.480 --> 05:49.400
you will have a community that will gather around you.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.200
And then finally, you can reach that consensus.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.960
Otherwise, if your proposal is not needed or is not appropriate,

05:58.960 --> 06:05.800
you will suddenly have rejection from the community or just nobody around you.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.120
So you can't reach consensus if there is nobody around you, right?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.240
So that's how it works.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.120
It's kind of democratic, in fact.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.520
It's having people gathering and trying to get better together.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.520
Each working group has leaders.

06:22.520 --> 06:29.040
So at the W3C, sorry, the WebRCC working group,

06:29.040 --> 06:34.480
we've got leaders from Microsoft and Mozilla and,

06:34.480 --> 06:38.720
I can't remember the third one, like the big players, maybe Google,

06:38.720 --> 06:40.680
or maybe not, I can't remember.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.120
Anyway, so the big players are the leaders.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.280
And the leaders, being a leader is a role that involves you

06:49.280 --> 06:55.160
to push forward the group without taking directions.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.840
So you need to provide energy to the group.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.680
You need to make the whole process to go on and on.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.680
Make sure that there is a real consensus around the table.

07:06.680 --> 07:12.720
And trying to, in the end, realize the mission of the working group.

07:12.720 --> 07:20.480
So the WebRCC working group has some topics.

07:20.480 --> 07:25.000
So they worked on different topics in the past.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.960
We can have some mature topics that are already deployed

07:29.960 --> 07:34.320
in the different solutions, different browsers.

07:34.320 --> 07:40.160
And so you can recognize those APIs that you might use every day.

07:40.160 --> 07:45.160
So you can see that those APIs are widely accepted.

07:45.160 --> 07:45.880
They are solid.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.760
They are fundamental, in fact.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.360
So you can build on that.

07:49.360 --> 07:54.080
And there are also some topics that are still in discussion.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.920
More or less, mature, but still in discussion.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.880
And those are still moving things.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.240
You can see quite interesting topics in there.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.320
Especially topics that are optimization

08:08.320 --> 08:12.720
for having better quality, core quality, video quality

08:12.720 --> 08:14.720
in your application.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.680
So it's like more technical things.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.120
And also things that are more related to the UX.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.200
How you will make the UX better when you handle the communication

08:25.200 --> 08:29.240
through the WebRCC APIs implemented in the browsers.

08:29.240 --> 08:34.000
For example, you've got this one, the capture handle.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.720
This is something quite interesting.

08:36.720 --> 08:41.120
It's like making sure that when you are in a tab in a browser

08:41.120 --> 08:44.720
and then you share another tab in the browser,

08:44.720 --> 08:48.160
that the two tabs are aware of each other.

08:48.160 --> 08:53.200
So that you can know that you are sharing a tab on a specific domain,

08:53.200 --> 09:01.120
for example, so that you can adapt your behavior as a WebRCC

09:01.120 --> 09:02.200
application.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.640
You can adapt the behavior of your application

09:04.640 --> 09:06.760
depending on what is shared.

09:06.760 --> 09:12.960
And the contrary also is when you share, as a tab is shared,

09:12.960 --> 09:19.640
the tab knows that it is actually streaming the content somewhere else.

09:19.640 --> 09:25.240
So you might also adapt the content of the tab depending on that.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.560
So that's quite interesting, right?

09:27.560 --> 09:32.640
We haven't thought about that quite often.

09:32.640 --> 09:38.200
And this topic has been raised by members of the working group.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.640
So if you want to raise a topic, you can.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.320
You can do it.

09:46.120 --> 09:52.320
The WebRCC working group is as a statement that defined its mission.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.560
And in fact, in that statement, that fundamental statement,

09:55.560 --> 10:00.480
they try to see what are the use cases that want to reach.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.240
And that's also giving a glance of what should be, what could be,

10:04.240 --> 10:11.360
the WebRCC API in the future, or what could be done through that API.

10:11.360 --> 10:16.320
So for example, Firecherring, that's great use case.

10:16.320 --> 10:23.840
I don't know what it's so used.

10:23.840 --> 10:30.160
The Funny Hats use case, which brings a lot of technical challenges

10:30.160 --> 10:35.080
around that, and also bringing resources from the browser

10:35.080 --> 10:45.240
to get involved into the WebRCC protocol, and the rendering of the videos.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.560
And you've got those things that are trendy.

10:48.560 --> 10:54.200
All these things that analyzes off the voice and also the image.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.960
They call that face, but we can, to maybe a broader perspective,

10:58.960 --> 11:04.160
with saying, how do we do the analyzes?

11:04.160 --> 11:09.560
How do we bring value to what is going through the channel offered

11:09.560 --> 11:11.320
by WebRCC?

11:11.320 --> 11:16.240
How do we add intelligence on top of that?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.720
So that's in the roadmap.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.160
You might already do that in your application,

11:20.160 --> 11:24.440
trying to make sure that it's quite stable, using the APIs that

11:24.440 --> 11:28.520
could be provided by your browsers, like Chromium,

11:28.520 --> 11:32.920
or Firefox, or I don't know which one is Safari,

11:32.920 --> 11:35.960
and try to make sure that it's quite balanced.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.800
I mean, you try to cover the gaps.

11:39.800 --> 11:47.640
So you know that if it's still in discussion as a standard,

11:47.640 --> 11:50.960
it might move in the future.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.000
All right, we've got other use cases, like low latency broadcast

11:55.000 --> 11:56.600
with P2P release.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.160
That was quite a topic, I think.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.080
And that's a technical change, which is very high.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.120
But you know that it's something that

12:05.120 --> 12:11.680
might be addressed by the working group in the near future.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.560
So how do you contact?

12:13.560 --> 12:15.080
How do you get info?

12:15.080 --> 12:18.120
How do you engage with the working group?

12:18.120 --> 12:22.240
So that's kind of the API of the working group.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.920
They've got a website.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.320
There is plenty of things.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.560
It's an institution, right?

12:27.560 --> 12:29.840
It's an organization for standardization.

12:29.840 --> 12:34.120
So it's quite a massive amount of text.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.000
But there is also a monthly discussion.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.800
So you can just broadcast it on YouTube.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.320
So you can drop by and listen to the topics that

12:42.320 --> 12:44.920
are currently discussed.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.920
It's quite technical topics, right?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.480
But it's very interesting to know

12:48.480 --> 12:54.000
how it works, like the process of getting a consensus.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.920
You've got some samples that you can

12:55.920 --> 12:58.520
try on the future implementation.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.960
So you've got those topics that are still in discussion.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.360
And when you go through that process,

13:04.360 --> 13:07.520
and at the end of the processes, they

13:07.520 --> 13:09.720
try to get to release some sample.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.520
What should be the standard should look like when

13:13.520 --> 13:15.760
you use that in the browser?

13:15.760 --> 13:18.800
Or you use it not only in the browser,

13:18.800 --> 13:23.160
but most of the samples are in browsers.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.880
And finally, there is a massive amount

13:24.880 --> 13:27.920
of working group repository.

13:27.920 --> 13:32.400
It's mainly repositories for handling

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
the modifications of documents.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.160
As you want to progress as a standard,

13:37.160 --> 13:42.840
you need to agree on a formal documentation of the standard.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.120
And in fact, those repos are mostly

13:45.120 --> 13:50.000
used for making sure that everyone that has an issue

13:50.000 --> 13:51.760
can raise a point, and then the point

13:51.760 --> 13:54.120
can be discussed, and a proposal can also

13:54.120 --> 13:59.080
be done through those repos.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.240
If you are only a participant, not a member,

14:02.240 --> 14:05.320
you can go into that discussion.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.560
You can propose things.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.680
You don't have the voice.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.880
Your voice is not as powerful as if you were a member.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.200
But in fact, you can drop your ideas.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.440
And for having discussed with them,

14:20.440 --> 14:24.160
they're quite open with different point of view.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.240
And especially when you are a user of those technologies,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.920
they are kind to have some feedback on what

14:30.920 --> 14:33.240
they're proposing.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.760
How to engage?

14:34.760 --> 14:38.840
There is a massive event from the W3C

14:38.840 --> 14:41.720
that is happening in Siberia, which is quite near.

14:41.720 --> 14:46.120
I mean, it's not a good place.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.520
It will be in September next year.

14:49.520 --> 14:54.680
And there is also a mailing list and an IRC channel.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.840
How to contribute?

14:57.840 --> 15:01.040
They are promoting the thing that you use GitHub

15:01.040 --> 15:05.000
for any suggestion.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.240
They want to track everything.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.520
It's a distributed, decentralized working group.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.440
So they want things to be written so that also it's

15:13.440 --> 15:17.960
precise, so that it can be discussed afterward

15:17.960 --> 15:20.760
in a meeting.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.960
You can propose new topics if you want.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.120
For example, I talked about starting something

15:26.120 --> 15:29.560
about energy consumption and web RTC.

15:29.560 --> 15:30.520
That might be good.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.200
Also to understand how we impact the energy

15:34.200 --> 15:36.720
consumption of all the high-end devices

15:36.720 --> 15:38.960
and also maybe in the networks across,

15:38.960 --> 15:45.320
to understand what is our impact on developing new features,

15:45.320 --> 15:47.440
and trying to get that into the balance when

15:47.440 --> 15:49.240
you choose adding new features.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.320
And if you want to get more info, I'm not.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.720
Yeah, yeah, I'm about.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.800
It has the last slide.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.160
I'm about to.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.000
Sorry, sorry.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.480
So I'm not from the W3C, just for you to know.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.640
But you can reach out those people.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.720
And they are dedicated staff for the WebRTC working group.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.760
They are very friendly.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.920
They are open for discussion.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.160
They can also bring you on the boat.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.480
So just reach out to them.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.440
And you can find those slides in my GitHub account.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.960
Thank you.

16:23.960 --> 16:24.440
Just in time.

16:24.440 --> 16:30.560
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.120
All right.

16:32.120 --> 16:37.480
Join me on every Thursday at the WebRTC World Card Show.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.440
It's on Twitch.

16:38.440 --> 16:38.920
Thank you.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.680
Any question?

16:44.680 --> 16:45.560
No.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.060
Yes.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.880
Yeah.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.840
What are you exactly doing from the perspective

16:53.840 --> 16:57.080
of the decentralizing messaging?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.680
Me, myself?

16:58.680 --> 17:01.160
No, nothing.

17:01.160 --> 17:01.680
No.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.000
In fact, so there is no, as far as I know,

17:05.000 --> 17:11.040
I went through a lot of reports of what

17:11.040 --> 17:13.240
is happening in the working group.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.880
And I have not seen much thing about decentralized messaging.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.840
But if you want to start something about that,

17:20.840 --> 17:22.440
they are OK for getting some help.

17:32.040 --> 17:32.600
Any question?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.480
Thank you.

17:36.480 --> 17:36.960
Thank you.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.440
Thank you.

17:37.440 --> 17:43.600
Thanks a lot.
