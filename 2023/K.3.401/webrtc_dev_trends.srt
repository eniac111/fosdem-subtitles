1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.400
This is actually my first time at FOSDEM.

2
0:00:08.400 --> 0:00:11.920
I've been meaning to come here for many,

3
0:00:11.920 --> 0:00:13.600
many years since I will.

4
0:00:13.600 --> 0:00:15.720
Lorenzo been bothering me that I should come here and speak.

5
0:00:15.720 --> 0:00:18.560
So I'm glad actually I finally made it.

6
0:00:19.840 --> 0:00:23.980
I run a blog, WebRcHacks for developers.

7
0:00:23.980 --> 0:00:28.860
I got a lot of guest authors and I hope readers in the audience here.

8
0:00:28.860 --> 0:00:31.700
You might also recognize me if you watch

9
0:00:31.700 --> 0:00:34.180
YouTube videos about WebRc stuff or do

10
0:00:34.180 --> 0:00:37.560
an event series and videos at Cranky Geek.

11
0:00:37.560 --> 0:00:43.880
But today, I'm here to talk about some trends I did by

12
0:00:43.880 --> 0:00:46.360
analyzing GitHub and some other repositories.

13
0:00:46.360 --> 0:00:47.120
I'll talk about that in a second.

14
0:00:47.120 --> 0:00:48.640
But before we start,

15
0:00:48.640 --> 0:00:50.840
what are some things that would be nice to

16
0:00:50.840 --> 0:00:52.600
know what's going on in the industry?

17
0:00:52.600 --> 0:00:56.240
I'm an analyst like to watch this stuff and write about it.

18
0:00:56.240 --> 0:00:58.800
So one, is the community still growing?

19
0:00:58.800 --> 0:01:00.440
What are some of the interesting projects?

20
0:01:00.440 --> 0:01:02.080
What are some of the new trends?

21
0:01:02.080 --> 0:01:06.040
Are people using things like WebCodecs yet or not?

22
0:01:06.040 --> 0:01:08.720
So how do you go about doing that?

23
0:01:08.720 --> 0:01:12.360
Well, I came up with a methodology.

24
0:01:12.360 --> 0:01:18.520
It's largely based on BigQuery and there's a bunch of providers

25
0:01:18.520 --> 0:01:22.680
give data to BigQuery or make their datasets public available there.

26
0:01:22.680 --> 0:01:23.640
So you can grab that.

27
0:01:23.640 --> 0:01:25.720
GitHub is definitely the best one,

28
0:01:25.720 --> 0:01:28.520
basically any time, any public repo,

29
0:01:28.520 --> 0:01:30.200
anytime you do any kind of commit,

30
0:01:30.200 --> 0:01:36.360
pull request issue that all gets sent and stored in a BigQuery database.

31
0:01:36.360 --> 0:01:39.960
There's actually some other datasets that are cool in there too.

32
0:01:39.960 --> 0:01:43.520
I've used in the past and I actually used Stack Overflow in this one.

33
0:01:43.520 --> 0:01:46.240
I often cross-reference that with other sources like

34
0:01:46.240 --> 0:01:50.000
there's the Chrome platform status is a good way to see what

35
0:01:50.000 --> 0:01:54.920
actual APIs are being used at least in the Chrome world.

36
0:01:54.920 --> 0:01:57.760
So you get all that data.

37
0:01:57.760 --> 0:02:00.760
I actually like to use Colab which is just

38
0:02:00.760 --> 0:02:05.800
a Google's hosted Jupyter Notebook type ecosystem

39
0:02:05.800 --> 0:02:07.920
to do the analysis and follow things and then when I get

40
0:02:07.920 --> 0:02:13.640
frustrated about coding and doing stuff like making charts with Python,

41
0:02:13.640 --> 0:02:16.760
then I fall back to Excel for quick analysis.

42
0:02:16.760 --> 0:02:19.320
So some of the hard things about this and important to keep in

43
0:02:19.320 --> 0:02:21.440
mind about the analysis, you can't see it there.

44
0:02:21.440 --> 0:02:26.000
But all this is really based on regular expressions and pulling out

45
0:02:26.000 --> 0:02:34.040
keywords to identify a repo as WebRTC or something as one term or another.

46
0:02:34.040 --> 0:02:37.800
So that obviously has some flaws because there'd be false hits in there,

47
0:02:37.800 --> 0:02:39.360
and you have to be careful with your selection.

48
0:02:39.360 --> 0:02:41.120
So a lot of time I spend is actually just going

49
0:02:41.120 --> 0:02:43.160
through looking at the data and make sure it's not junk.

50
0:02:43.160 --> 0:02:45.800
I found in the past there's a lot of bots.

51
0:02:45.800 --> 0:02:50.000
So you got to remove those things and these datasets themselves aren't perfect.

52
0:02:50.000 --> 0:02:52.040
There's always missing data or junk data.

53
0:02:52.040 --> 0:02:54.080
So keep that in mind.

54
0:02:54.080 --> 0:02:57.560
But I've been doing this occasionally,

55
0:02:57.560 --> 0:02:59.480
more frequently now since 2015.

56
0:02:59.480 --> 0:03:01.640
I've been tweaking the methodology along the way.

57
0:03:01.640 --> 0:03:03.720
It's held up so far,

58
0:03:03.720 --> 0:03:06.400
but always open to feedback.

59
0:03:06.400 --> 0:03:10.480
So let's just dive in. How are we doing here in WebRTC?

60
0:03:10.480 --> 0:03:13.600
So this just looks since 2019.

61
0:03:13.600 --> 0:03:16.400
I don't think it's a big surprise to anyone,

62
0:03:16.400 --> 0:03:19.320
but there was a peak during the pandemic.

63
0:03:19.320 --> 0:03:23.680
So you can see here it's actually April of that year.

64
0:03:23.680 --> 0:03:27.440
This particular graph shows distinct users.

65
0:03:27.440 --> 0:03:29.880
So anybody had anyone on GitHub,

66
0:03:29.880 --> 0:03:33.720
just based on unique GitHub IDs per period in there.

67
0:03:33.720 --> 0:03:35.960
So that was over 10,000 in April.

68
0:03:35.960 --> 0:03:37.280
But if you look here, actually,

69
0:03:37.280 --> 0:03:38.560
we're not doing so bad.

70
0:03:38.560 --> 0:03:41.600
This is a bad data that was missing that month.

71
0:03:41.600 --> 0:03:44.160
We're not actually doing so bad here,

72
0:03:44.160 --> 0:03:47.600
but we're only about 60 percent a past peak.

73
0:03:47.600 --> 0:03:52.880
So it's still pretty above where we were before the pandemic.

74
0:03:52.880 --> 0:03:56.400
But another thing I find actually very interesting is,

75
0:03:56.400 --> 0:03:58.680
also because you can look at these events,

76
0:03:58.680 --> 0:04:00.240
who's actually contributing?

77
0:04:00.240 --> 0:04:02.320
You can look at the blog.

78
0:04:02.320 --> 0:04:05.240
I'll have some links to more on the methodology.

79
0:04:05.240 --> 0:04:07.440
But essentially, people doing pull requests,

80
0:04:07.440 --> 0:04:09.040
pull request reviews,

81
0:04:09.040 --> 0:04:12.520
that sort of thing that counts as a contributor.

82
0:04:12.520 --> 0:04:15.040
And actual contributors, if you believe that,

83
0:04:15.040 --> 0:04:18.480
are actually up more than ever.

84
0:04:18.480 --> 0:04:21.440
So first, one interesting point here,

85
0:04:21.440 --> 0:04:24.600
you can see I show there was a peak number of users in April,

86
0:04:24.600 --> 0:04:27.640
but actually the peak contributions was in actually May.

87
0:04:27.640 --> 0:04:28.760
And maybe that makes sense.

88
0:04:28.760 --> 0:04:30.840
Like people during a pandemic,

89
0:04:30.840 --> 0:04:33.080
got interested in WebRCH sees, start looking at it,

90
0:04:33.080 --> 0:04:37.040
they maybe could star a repo,

91
0:04:37.040 --> 0:04:38.160
join it, get involved.

92
0:04:38.160 --> 0:04:40.320
But then it takes them a few weeks actually

93
0:04:40.320 --> 0:04:41.680
before they actually contribute,

94
0:04:41.680 --> 0:04:44.080
start adding things into that repo.

95
0:04:44.080 --> 0:04:45.520
But as I said here,

96
0:04:45.520 --> 0:04:48.760
actually our most recent peak here was actually in August.

97
0:04:48.760 --> 0:04:50.360
And we're not actually too far

98
0:04:50.360 --> 0:04:51.960
off for the rest of the year looking at that.

99
0:04:51.960 --> 0:04:53.800
So I want to look in to see what was going

100
0:04:53.800 --> 0:04:56.960
on and compare these two peaks.

101
0:04:56.960 --> 0:05:01.360
So one is, this is actually from the August peak,

102
0:05:01.360 --> 0:05:02.920
I dug into the sea,

103
0:05:02.920 --> 0:05:04.560
where some of the repos that were actually

104
0:05:04.560 --> 0:05:06.840
having had the most activity.

105
0:05:06.840 --> 0:05:10.720
And one of them, very popular WebRCH project is CoTurn,

106
0:05:10.720 --> 0:05:14.720
the open source kind of stone and turn server.

107
0:05:14.720 --> 0:05:18.040
And actually one of my coworkers, Gustavo,

108
0:05:18.040 --> 0:05:18.880
took over that project.

109
0:05:18.880 --> 0:05:20.360
So I asked him what was going on here,

110
0:05:20.360 --> 0:05:24.400
what happened, why did we have such a big spike in this?

111
0:05:24.400 --> 0:05:26.040
And I wrote a whole blog post about it.

112
0:05:26.040 --> 0:05:30.520
But essentially, that project was kind of stale,

113
0:05:30.520 --> 0:05:32.320
not a lot of activity for a while.

114
0:05:32.320 --> 0:05:36.160
He and Pavel took that over

115
0:05:36.160 --> 0:05:38.520
and then started really get the community involved

116
0:05:38.520 --> 0:05:40.280
and there's a huge spike.

117
0:05:40.280 --> 0:05:44.360
And things were so then I wondered is,

118
0:05:44.360 --> 0:05:47.120
basically is this, sorry,

119
0:05:47.120 --> 0:05:50.560
is the peak the other peaks like in August in here,

120
0:05:50.560 --> 0:05:51.760
are they because of spikes

121
0:05:51.760 --> 0:05:53.600
or is there a lot of like regular activity?

122
0:05:53.600 --> 0:05:55.000
I mean, you can see here, there's,

123
0:05:55.000 --> 0:05:58.240
interestingly you see things like AdGuard

124
0:05:59.440 --> 0:06:00.320
is always high in there,

125
0:06:00.320 --> 0:06:02.560
like people actually applying to block WebRCH

126
0:06:02.560 --> 0:06:03.600
and its usage, right?

127
0:06:03.600 --> 0:06:07.960
But they have a lot of activity every month around that.

128
0:06:07.960 --> 0:06:09.560
But actually it wasn't actually,

129
0:06:09.560 --> 0:06:12.800
you see some commonality, but some difference here.

130
0:06:12.800 --> 0:06:15.640
And, whoa, sorry.

131
0:06:15.640 --> 0:06:18.200
But when you actually look at the distributions

132
0:06:18.200 --> 0:06:21.240
and the change between April of 2020

133
0:06:21.240 --> 0:06:23.360
and August of 2022,

134
0:06:23.360 --> 0:06:25.160
the actual distributions across the top 10,

135
0:06:25.160 --> 0:06:26.760
top 20, top 100,

136
0:06:26.760 --> 0:06:29.320
they're actually not a whole lot different.

137
0:06:29.320 --> 0:06:31.680
So what does this all mean?

138
0:06:31.680 --> 0:06:33.080
It's like actually the WebRCH development

139
0:06:33.080 --> 0:06:36.080
actually not really getting a lot more concentrated.

140
0:06:36.080 --> 0:06:37.480
You can look for a given period of time,

141
0:06:37.480 --> 0:06:39.600
obviously some projects are doing more popular

142
0:06:39.600 --> 0:06:42.440
and doing well, have more activity than others.

143
0:06:42.440 --> 0:06:45.440
But overall, it's not like we're consolidating down

144
0:06:45.440 --> 0:06:46.440
to a few projects, right?

145
0:06:46.440 --> 0:06:51.440
It's the same kind of more equal distribution that's existed

146
0:06:51.840 --> 0:06:53.280
at least for several years now.

147
0:06:54.560 --> 0:06:56.800
So another dataset,

148
0:06:56.800 --> 0:06:59.660
and this is actually a new one I hadn't looked at before,

149
0:06:59.660 --> 0:07:01.760
is Stack Overflow.

150
0:07:01.760 --> 0:07:06.040
So I zoomed in to take a look at that.

151
0:07:06.040 --> 0:07:09.040
And that's to see if this follows a similar pattern.

152
0:07:09.040 --> 0:07:11.120
Now, bear in mind compared to the previous charts,

153
0:07:11.120 --> 0:07:13.160
this goes back all the way to 2012,

154
0:07:13.160 --> 0:07:14.920
so it's a much longer data period.

155
0:07:14.920 --> 0:07:16.840
And you can see here,

156
0:07:17.700 --> 0:07:20.520
this is comments on Stack Overflow questions

157
0:07:20.520 --> 0:07:23.280
and actually the questions themselves.

158
0:07:23.280 --> 0:07:26.720
And unfortunately you can't see the font too much

159
0:07:26.720 --> 0:07:29.000
of answers within Stack Overflow,

160
0:07:29.000 --> 0:07:30.820
but it essentially looks very similar

161
0:07:30.820 --> 0:07:33.000
to the questions side of things.

162
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:37.620
And you can see very similar here, peak in April of 2020.

163
0:07:39.480 --> 0:07:43.560
Also, unlike the GitHub analysis,

164
0:07:43.560 --> 0:07:45.160
this actually shows a peak

165
0:07:47.480 --> 0:07:50.760
is here also in April of 2022.

166
0:07:50.760 --> 0:07:52.360
I didn't have a chance to dig into to see

167
0:07:52.360 --> 0:07:55.760
what was driving that particular peak this year.

168
0:07:55.760 --> 0:07:58.120
But overall, I think you can see,

169
0:07:58.120 --> 0:07:59.640
it's a little bit harder compared to the other one,

170
0:07:59.640 --> 0:08:02.400
but we're still generally up compared to prior

171
0:08:02.400 --> 0:08:04.880
to the third pandemic in terms of questions and answers.

172
0:08:04.880 --> 0:08:06.360
And actually it's a pretty good sign

173
0:08:06.360 --> 0:08:08.200
that there's a lot of activity there.

174
0:08:09.600 --> 0:08:13.240
And I also wanted to just took a look to see

175
0:08:13.240 --> 0:08:16.360
as a percentage of all the questions on Stack Overflow,

176
0:08:16.360 --> 0:08:19.040
what percentage of them had at least something

177
0:08:19.040 --> 0:08:22.600
that mentioned WebRTC or one of these terms.

178
0:08:22.600 --> 0:08:25.680
And very surprising actually, it's actually very high.

179
0:08:27.080 --> 0:08:32.080
So it's something like one in,

180
0:08:32.080 --> 0:08:35.560
during the pandemic, it was one out of every 1400 questions

181
0:08:35.560 --> 0:08:38.240
on Stack Overflow had something that mentioned WebRTC,

182
0:08:38.240 --> 0:08:39.760
which that seems like quite a bit

183
0:08:39.760 --> 0:08:42.400
because I still consider WebRTC kind of a very

184
0:08:42.400 --> 0:08:43.480
niche sort of thing.

185
0:08:43.480 --> 0:08:46.920
And even if you look today, just in this,

186
0:08:46.920 --> 0:08:49.640
well, the last data point in this one is November,

187
0:08:49.640 --> 0:08:52.160
at that point it was still one in, I'm sorry,

188
0:08:52.160 --> 0:08:57.160
it was one in 900 during the peak of April of 2020.

189
0:08:58.480 --> 0:09:00.280
It's still one in 1400 today,

190
0:09:00.280 --> 0:09:01.840
which is it was still actually very high.

191
0:09:01.840 --> 0:09:04.360
So you can see, you can interpret this two ways.

192
0:09:04.360 --> 0:09:06.320
One, WebRTC is very confusing

193
0:09:06.320 --> 0:09:07.720
and people have a lot of questions.

194
0:09:07.720 --> 0:09:08.680
So they need to comment on it.

195
0:09:08.680 --> 0:09:10.200
Or you can also see there's a lot of people involved.

196
0:09:10.200 --> 0:09:13.040
Like I, both are good, right?

197
0:09:15.440 --> 0:09:16.280
But yeah.

198
0:09:17.680 --> 0:09:21.920
So also very interested, can we look at this dataset

199
0:09:21.920 --> 0:09:24.800
to understand development trends, what's going on

200
0:09:25.880 --> 0:09:26.720
in the market?

201
0:09:26.720 --> 0:09:28.200
And one of the very interesting things

202
0:09:28.200 --> 0:09:29.600
I always like to look at is what are some

203
0:09:29.600 --> 0:09:32.520
of the language trends, programming languages

204
0:09:32.520 --> 0:09:33.720
that people are using.

205
0:09:33.720 --> 0:09:35.720
And this is a jumble and hard to see.

206
0:09:35.720 --> 0:09:38.280
So let's actually zoom in.

207
0:09:38.280 --> 0:09:41.200
So one of the ones I've been trying to track for a while

208
0:09:41.200 --> 0:09:43.360
is JavaScript versus TypeScript.

209
0:09:43.360 --> 0:09:48.360
I've been delaying converting to TypeScript.

210
0:09:48.880 --> 0:09:50.760
And I'm kind of wondering, do I need to,

211
0:09:50.760 --> 0:09:52.640
is it time for me to really switch over?

212
0:09:52.640 --> 0:09:54.180
Can I wait a little bit longer?

213
0:09:54.180 --> 0:09:56.240
You can see here, well, obviously TypeScript

214
0:09:56.240 --> 0:09:57.760
has been getting more popular.

215
0:09:57.760 --> 0:10:01.840
We just, in December, reached the 50-50 point.

216
0:10:04.480 --> 0:10:06.680
Of all these repos, where TypeScript's half.

217
0:10:06.680 --> 0:10:09.760
So I think I'm probably behind and need to switch.

218
0:10:13.600 --> 0:10:16.840
So there's also, at this conference,

219
0:10:16.840 --> 0:10:19.600
a bunch of exciting new languages that are coming out.

220
0:10:19.600 --> 0:10:21.840
So I wanted to zoom in and kind of take a look

221
0:10:21.840 --> 0:10:24.120
to see what's going on with them.

222
0:10:24.120 --> 0:10:27.920
So Go, Kotlin, and Rust in particular.

223
0:10:27.920 --> 0:10:30.960
So I will say one of the challenges,

224
0:10:30.960 --> 0:10:32.420
I didn't get any chance to filter this out,

225
0:10:32.420 --> 0:10:37.420
but this Go jump from November to December is some bots.

226
0:10:38.800 --> 0:10:39.760
It's just bot activity.

227
0:10:39.760 --> 0:10:40.880
So you can, yeah.

228
0:10:40.880 --> 0:10:43.480
I thought originally maybe it's just Christmas

229
0:10:43.480 --> 0:10:45.440
and Go developers don't have anything better to do.

230
0:10:45.440 --> 0:10:48.640
So over the holidays, they're just programming a lot

231
0:10:48.640 --> 0:10:49.640
and starting a lot of new repos.

232
0:10:49.640 --> 0:10:52.060
That wasn't, it actually was some bugs.

233
0:10:52.060 --> 0:10:55.160
But you can see here, this steadily increasing.

234
0:10:55.160 --> 0:10:58.840
It's not a huge, huge spike for these other two,

235
0:10:58.840 --> 0:11:00.140
but it is going up.

236
0:11:01.360 --> 0:11:03.120
And as a new language that's getting popular,

237
0:11:03.120 --> 0:11:05.920
I guess you'd expect to, you're gonna see more of that.

238
0:11:07.320 --> 0:11:09.840
So in addition to languages, also there's a bunch

239
0:11:09.840 --> 0:11:13.680
of the new APIs, some that were referenced earlier today.

240
0:11:13.680 --> 0:11:17.880
So insertable streams is one such API,

241
0:11:17.880 --> 0:11:19.960
and that's actually two sub-APIs,

242
0:11:19.960 --> 0:11:22.800
MediaStream Track Processor and Track Generator.

243
0:11:23.720 --> 0:11:25.560
First took a look on Chrome status

244
0:11:25.560 --> 0:11:29.080
and actually credit to Phippo, Phil Panky

245
0:11:29.080 --> 0:11:32.180
for having a, he built a custom viewer

246
0:11:32.180 --> 0:11:33.820
of the Chrome status information.

247
0:11:35.120 --> 0:11:37.880
They can see here, so compare them both at the same time.

248
0:11:37.880 --> 0:11:40.940
You can see that these are actually peaking quite a bit

249
0:11:40.940 --> 0:11:42.120
towards the end of the year, going up quite a bit.

250
0:11:42.120 --> 0:11:44.920
So I was curious, like who can we see?

251
0:11:44.920 --> 0:11:46.800
Are open source repos actually using these

252
0:11:46.800 --> 0:11:48.600
or is it somebody else?

253
0:11:48.600 --> 0:11:53.520
And looking at it, there's a big spike here,

254
0:11:53.520 --> 0:11:57.240
but it doesn't look like much, so what's going on there?

255
0:11:57.240 --> 0:11:58.600
You zoom in a little bit more, and again,

256
0:11:58.600 --> 0:12:01.960
apologies, it's really small, but like that initial spike,

257
0:12:01.960 --> 0:12:05.240
a lot of that was just pure standards-related activity

258
0:12:06.720 --> 0:12:10.320
of the W3C repos and WebKit and others

259
0:12:10.320 --> 0:12:12.760
that are just basically adopting those APIs

260
0:12:12.760 --> 0:12:13.760
in the first place.

261
0:12:13.760 --> 0:12:15.220
So you see a big jump.

262
0:12:15.220 --> 0:12:17.200
After that, it's really kind of hit or miss.

263
0:12:17.200 --> 0:12:20.000
And I was, I mean, I love working with it

264
0:12:20.000 --> 0:12:22.880
in server streams, what's he do, a lot of fun stuff.

265
0:12:22.880 --> 0:12:26.160
It's hoping to see more, but it's kind of just spotty.

266
0:12:26.160 --> 0:12:28.520
So going back to the Chrome status, what does that mean?

267
0:12:28.520 --> 0:12:30.480
Well, at least people that are using it

268
0:12:30.480 --> 0:12:34.320
are probably someone like Google Meet,

269
0:12:34.320 --> 0:12:36.480
that sort of thing that don't have public repos, right?

270
0:12:36.480 --> 0:12:39.300
Or there's something else outside of the public

271
0:12:39.300 --> 0:12:41.780
GitHub data set that's driving that usage.

272
0:12:43.880 --> 0:12:46.720
So another one is WebCodecs.

273
0:12:46.720 --> 0:12:47.560
It's another one.

274
0:12:47.560 --> 0:12:48.720
This one doesn't have quite the same peak.

275
0:12:48.720 --> 0:12:52.920
It's a little bit, WebCodecs is not quite as far along,

276
0:12:52.920 --> 0:12:54.720
but they're still driving up.

277
0:12:54.720 --> 0:12:57.400
We're gonna see if there's something going on here too.

278
0:12:57.400 --> 0:13:00.880
And again, you see gradual increase, not a ton,

279
0:13:00.880 --> 0:13:02.040
except for this one spike.

280
0:13:02.040 --> 0:13:05.280
And this one spike, again, was largely related to

281
0:13:05.280 --> 0:13:09.480
the initial standards release of WebKit

282
0:13:09.480 --> 0:13:13.120
and W3C type repos and related once to deploy that.

283
0:13:13.120 --> 0:13:17.920
So we see some uptick, but nothing all that significant yet.

284
0:13:20.880 --> 0:13:23.500
And for the last section,

285
0:13:25.360 --> 0:13:27.360
I was also wondering, is WebRTC winning?

286
0:13:27.360 --> 0:13:29.480
Like we don't talk a whole lot about WebRTC

287
0:13:29.480 --> 0:13:31.000
having competition so much anymore,

288
0:13:31.000 --> 0:13:32.760
at least I haven't, but in the early days,

289
0:13:32.760 --> 0:13:34.800
it was always WebRTC versus SIP.

290
0:13:34.800 --> 0:13:37.080
And is it, should SIP, those SIP type developers,

291
0:13:37.080 --> 0:13:39.640
that ecosystem, should they shift over to WebRTC?

292
0:13:39.640 --> 0:13:40.720
And we haven't seen that a whole lot,

293
0:13:40.720 --> 0:13:43.960
but I think in reality, there still is competition.

294
0:13:43.960 --> 0:13:48.280
And certainly during the pandemic, well, it's Zoom, right?

295
0:13:48.280 --> 0:13:51.000
And I actually presented this a couple of years ago

296
0:13:51.000 --> 0:13:53.960
at Dan's conference, an interesting fact where,

297
0:13:53.960 --> 0:13:57.280
there was a month in time where Zoom was worth more

298
0:13:57.280 --> 0:13:59.640
than the seventh largest airlines put together,

299
0:13:59.640 --> 0:14:00.760
at least their market capitalization,

300
0:14:00.760 --> 0:14:02.560
which is still insane when you think about it, right?

301
0:14:02.560 --> 0:14:03.880
But that was a reality.

302
0:14:03.880 --> 0:14:06.520
So I did wanna check to see if that's still the case,

303
0:14:06.520 --> 0:14:09.460
and it's not, right?

304
0:14:09.460 --> 0:14:13.440
So yeah, Zoom is using that to the same data point

305
0:14:13.440 --> 0:14:16.240
and just extending it out a little bit further.

306
0:14:16.240 --> 0:14:18.760
Zoom's down the other 80% where they were

307
0:14:18.760 --> 0:14:21.000
back in February of 2020.

308
0:14:21.000 --> 0:14:22.560
The airlines though aren't actually doing

309
0:14:22.560 --> 0:14:23.400
all that much better, right?

310
0:14:23.400 --> 0:14:26.880
So relative, Zoom's not doing some bad relative

311
0:14:26.880 --> 0:14:29.320
to the airlines, at least those same seven.

312
0:14:30.540 --> 0:14:33.160
But anyway, Zoom, not quite what it was,

313
0:14:33.160 --> 0:14:37.240
but they still really are competition, right?

314
0:14:37.240 --> 0:14:39.240
And particularly because Zoom, as it is now,

315
0:14:39.240 --> 0:14:40.600
is released as Zoom SDK,

316
0:14:40.600 --> 0:14:42.200
and they have a web version of this SDK.

317
0:14:42.200 --> 0:14:46.440
So as a developer, you do have a choice,

318
0:14:46.440 --> 0:14:47.560
hey, I wanna go build

319
0:14:47.560 --> 0:14:49.600
a real-time communications application.

320
0:14:49.600 --> 0:14:51.360
You can choose to use the WebRTC

321
0:14:51.360 --> 0:14:52.760
and all the vendors in Econsistent,

322
0:14:52.760 --> 0:14:55.160
or you can go to choose Zoom for this.

323
0:14:55.160 --> 0:14:58.040
And I was curious, and Zoom's marketing us a lot.

324
0:14:58.040 --> 0:14:59.400
I'll probably have a post on WebRTC,

325
0:14:59.400 --> 0:15:02.900
a Hacks with Thippo, hopefully in a few weeks

326
0:15:02.900 --> 0:15:05.840
that Zoom's been promoting the benefits of this.

327
0:15:05.840 --> 0:15:10.160
And it's a, I'll go into why

328
0:15:10.160 --> 0:15:12.640
that's not completely true during the post,

329
0:15:12.640 --> 0:15:16.720
but I wanted to see our developers actually choosing Zoom

330
0:15:16.720 --> 0:15:20.720
over, or at least mentioning the Zoom SDK over WebRTC.

331
0:15:22.720 --> 0:15:25.360
It was gonna take me a while to dig into all this,

332
0:15:25.360 --> 0:15:28.080
the GitHub analysis, it wasn't clear.

333
0:15:28.080 --> 0:15:30.160
So I didn't include that part yet.

334
0:15:30.160 --> 0:15:32.000
But on Stack Overflow, it's pretty actually clear.

335
0:15:32.000 --> 0:15:35.880
There's a distinct Zoom SDK tag or label

336
0:15:35.880 --> 0:15:36.940
that they have there.

337
0:15:36.940 --> 0:15:38.920
And you can see here, actually, at least for now,

338
0:15:38.920 --> 0:15:42.640
WebRTC is still way more popular than the Zoom SDK.

339
0:15:44.220 --> 0:15:45.800
Two minutes, okay.

340
0:15:45.800 --> 0:15:48.140
And actually, I am done.

341
0:15:48.140 --> 0:15:50.920
So I guess what we would learn here,

342
0:15:50.920 --> 0:15:53.000
I mean, part of it is, what are your expectations here?

343
0:15:53.000 --> 0:15:55.080
I didn't necessarily go into any expectations

344
0:15:55.080 --> 0:15:56.660
other than I was interested to see

345
0:15:56.660 --> 0:15:58.400
what are some of the trends and can we find

346
0:15:58.400 --> 0:16:01.760
or learn things about new APIs or new repos.

347
0:16:01.760 --> 0:16:03.320
And I do go through the list actually,

348
0:16:03.320 --> 0:16:05.280
is interested in seeing new projects.

349
0:16:05.280 --> 0:16:06.640
Didn't have time to fit all that stuff in there,

350
0:16:06.640 --> 0:16:09.340
but again, you can reference some of the blog posts on this.

351
0:16:09.340 --> 0:16:10.800
But overall, my impression of WebRTC

352
0:16:10.800 --> 0:16:11.840
is still doing pretty well.

353
0:16:11.840 --> 0:16:13.520
Obviously, it's not pandemic well,

354
0:16:13.520 --> 0:16:16.340
but given the circumstances were better

355
0:16:16.340 --> 0:16:18.360
than it was before the pandemic,

356
0:16:18.360 --> 0:16:19.640
we have more developers involved.

357
0:16:19.640 --> 0:16:21.720
And it seems that developers that are involved,

358
0:16:21.720 --> 0:16:23.280
it is a lot of measures to say that

359
0:16:23.280 --> 0:16:24.120
that's actually more mature,

360
0:16:24.120 --> 0:16:25.020
they're better developers, right?

361
0:16:25.020 --> 0:16:27.480
They're contributing more than in the past.

362
0:16:27.480 --> 0:16:29.080
And I think that's a great thing.

363
0:16:29.080 --> 0:16:30.640
Thank you.

364
0:16:30.640 --> 0:16:31.480
Thank you.

365
0:16:31.480 --> 0:16:59.280
Thank you.
