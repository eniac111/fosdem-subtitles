WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So let's start with our next talk.

00:02.000 --> 00:09.000
going to become women.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Sorry we were going a bit late because the project was not running.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
We have a brand new TV now.

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
So the next talk is about high-pile ups is

00:32.000 --> 00:42.000
Just a short talk about box line and current state.

01:02.000 --> 01:26.000
I gave a talk so far ago about power wires and I will just talk a little bit quickly.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
So a bit about what it became since last time and what it is.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
So it's kind of like a sort of D-Bus or a lot of medium or a core pipeline.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
So its functionality is basically show objects in a graph and pass data between them.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
So in terms of that we have a section called wire clumber.

01:57.000 --> 02:14.000
We have a couple of services like for example there is a pulse audio service that converts all your clients to barbed wire.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
We also have a replacement library to write a jackpot.

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
The purpose of this is to share all the videos.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
So we have video sharing, simple, I'll show you what I made.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
But also audio, functionality of the audio.

02:40.000 --> 02:55.000
So you need to do screen sharing in Wayland so you need to pass video from the GPU without touching the CPU to clients.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
So memory using file descriptors, stuff like that, zero copy.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
So it turned out in the end that it was also going to work for audio.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Audio passing around and then I started working on that.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
So the audio part is very much like a jack audio server.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Very simple how it passes the data around.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.000
So that you can build all the existing audio solutions.

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
So this is the current situation of what we have for audio and video.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
So you have the Bluetooth stack with Bluetooth that goes over the e-mails.

03:49.000 --> 04:00.000
There is also the camera now that talks about that to interface with the kernel video for Linux originally.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
There is still also the audio stuff.

04:04.000 --> 04:15.000
And then we have the session manager barbed wire there and then the applications that go through.

04:15.000 --> 04:35.000
So it is a replacement for audio server or native or jack lines.

04:35.000 --> 04:46.000
So originally for Wayland screen sharing it was implemented that the motor which is the compositor would expose inside the pipeline graph.

04:46.000 --> 04:56.000
It is called a node which is something, it is like this here it produces a video feed and then you can connect with clients and also that they.

04:56.000 --> 05:10.000
So this is all input process so different process connected to the barbed wire.

05:10.000 --> 05:26.000
So you can branch out, you can mix things and barbed wire make sure that the data flows around.

05:26.000 --> 05:45.000
So for audio support it is like pro audio model like Jack.

05:45.000 --> 05:56.000
So there is one buffer size to the whole graph just like Jack but it is dynamic it can change.

05:56.000 --> 06:10.000
So there is automatic format converted from sources and things.

06:10.000 --> 06:27.000
So with that core layer you can run Jack lines almost with very little translation and with a little server you can run also audio lines.

06:27.000 --> 06:40.000
So it copies basically stuff that was already there to partially from Jack but also from also audio retirement model is also used.

06:40.000 --> 06:51.000
It uses a copy of all the old audio stuff for managing the cards and the mixers and you plug in the headphones that switches things and remembers volume.

06:51.000 --> 07:12.000
It controls the volume styles and all of that that was just copied directly because that piece is very evolved over the years.

07:12.000 --> 07:28.000
So you can run all the Jack clients like that and they will show up like also audio clients which is still up there.

07:28.000 --> 07:51.000
So it was originally started for video with the screen sharing then a little detour to audio but we are actually back now to video and now that it works.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
So now we are basically working on the camera capturing stuff.

07:58.000 --> 07:58.000
So traditionally browsers like for WebRPC go directly to video for Linux using IOS

07:58.000 --> 08:08.000
videos and stuff like that.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
So it is very difficult to put anything in between there.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
This all needs to be rewritten.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
This is in the process.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Also newer cameras they need more stuff than what P

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
eermo gives.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
There is a new library called the camera that works to install this.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
You can have more about that in your camera.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
You can just go directly to video for Linux and walk.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So there is a layer needed.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So we need to rewrite the applications anyway.

08:36.000 --> 08:47.000
So then it is probably going to be written to Piedwars so that we can route the video more flexibly.

08:47.000 --> 09:01.000
So basically Piedwars we can write cameras and you can get them from clients.

09:01.000 --> 09:13.000
So this also means that you can have multiple apps going to the same camera.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.000
So the status currently is it has been in Piedwars for almost two years.

09:22.000 --> 09:32.000
It was API and ABI stable and so far we can make this work.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
It was made to default.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
We are made against all expectations.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I was a bit afraid that it doesn't work.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
That is not expected.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
So it became a default.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
So for the moment, Jack and Paul saw the feature.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Everything should work as it worked before.

09:58.000 --> 10:07.000
There is a couple of things that are not checked.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
There are alternatives to connect multiple Jacks.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
All the servers on the network.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
It is a very specific implementation.

10:23.000 --> 10:35.000
There are alternatives to the RTP based on which there are more compatible with the hardware.

10:35.000 --> 10:46.000
There are also a bunch of Piedwars that maybe nobody uses.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
So right now most of the stores are switching as well or have switched.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I think Debian is getting there.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Wuntu switched for 32.10.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
No more pulse audio.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
You have to note no more pulse audio.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
The only thing that is changed there is the server part.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
The client part of pulse audio is still in use.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
But it talks to a different server.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
It is a re-implementation of the pipeline.

11:24.000 --> 11:50.000
So what are we doing?

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
If you are on a laptop speaker, you only get it in the right channel.

11:57.000 --> 12:12.000
The right channel is is lapel.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
We are trying to work on various things here.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
The camera elements, we work on to get it all integrated.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.000
We are going to have a talk about this on Sunday.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
It is a whole bunch of things that need to be done.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
For example, for the camera, there is also a portal.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
We try to hide everything behind the portal that will manage the permissions.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Application can access the camera.

12:46.000 --> 12:57.000
Yes, it is sort of like other computers where you give access to an application.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
So that goes through the portal.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
We try to route everything to that.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
There are lots of applications to be in looking.

13:06.000 --> 13:14.000
For example, in the studio, there is a bit of a test case there for the camera and screen integration.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
There are merge requests ready to be merged.

13:22.000 --> 13:39.000
There are some more things.

13:39.000 --> 13:53.000
The result is that if you do a call in one of these browsers in a future version, you can do lots of fun stuff.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
You can add filters to the camera.

13:57.000 --> 14:15.000
For example, in the studio, you can do a virtual camera and then you can add that camera.

14:15.000 --> 14:37.000
I am sorry, I have never thought about that.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Repeat the question.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Can you repeat the question for the stream?

14:45.000 --> 15:11.000
The question was, Jack had a network transport and he also allowed compression.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
He tried to do the ABS, which is all that can be used.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
It is uncompressed.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
There are some more facts.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I am just curious.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
We have a product that actually uses that component in portfolio.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
Since I put it in order, my...

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Yes, the green zone.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
Yes, following up on that, there is a rock plugin.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.000
The suggestion is that there is a rock plugin.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
The rock toolkit is built over the E and also provides network transport.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
I do not know, does it do compression?

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
I do not know.

16:00.000 --> 16:15.000
It is a bit more generic streaming.

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
Are there any further plans to introduce a second processor?

16:24.000 --> 16:30.000
The question is, are there plans to add echo cancellation or other plugins?

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Echo cancellation, we have a module that you can load.

16:35.000 --> 16:43.000
Echo cancellation, we have to see echo cancel and load.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Signal processing, there is also a whole bunch of things.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
You can of course load jack tools to do this.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
We also have a native module that can load lots of Ld2 filters.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
You can use fullstruct filter chains.

17:04.000 --> 17:13.000
There is also easy effects, which is an app to manage the filters for you.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
There are quite a few options.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
We have an online question, is there a way to visually show pipeline use?

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
Yes.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
For visualizing the pipeline blocks, you can of course use jack tools.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
There is also a native toolkit to do this.

17:39.000 --> 18:03.000
You can also load later in the count.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
You said you had AES output, are you referring to AES67?

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
How are you dealing with the clocking elements of AES67?

18:15.000 --> 18:32.000
Are you just ignoring it?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
What happens if you don't?

18:34.000 --> 18:39.000
Do people just send garbage timestamps by default?

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
This is a big problem for receivers that need to look at the timestamps and go,

18:43.000 --> 18:55.000
I need to do something with it.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
What should a third party receiver do?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
If they have two different clocks, what does it do with the timestamps?

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
The timestamps in the receiver, what does the receiver do to synchronize itself to the screen?

19:10.000 --> 19:23.000
Basically follow the rate at which you receive data and try to adjust the consumption rate by resulting.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
You talked a lot about portals for video, is there also something similar for audio?

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
Like for example, I want to capture an application using video and audio.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
The question is, the portal for video, we talked about lockups, is there also a portal for audio?

19:41.000 --> 19:52.000
The answer is, we are thinking about it, but we don't have anything to change.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
Is there anything for networking video screens?

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
The question is, is there anything for networking video screens?

20:04.000 --> 20:14.000
Last, not sure.

20:14.000 --> 20:30.000
There are lots of things you can do, it's really hard to do.

20:30.000 --> 20:45.000
Thank you.
