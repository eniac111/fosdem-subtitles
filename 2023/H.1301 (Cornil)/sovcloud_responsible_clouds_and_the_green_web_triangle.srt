1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.440
If you can hear me at the back, coming through the sound, can you?

2
0:00:10.440 --> 0:00:14.720
Okay, it's, I think, it sounds like you can hear me at the back.

3
0:00:14.720 --> 0:00:16.320
Excellent, alright.

4
0:00:16.320 --> 0:00:21.760
Okay, well, it turns out I'm a little bit early, but I'm going to use those two minutes

5
0:00:21.760 --> 0:00:24.280
for questions at the end of the talk if possible.

6
0:00:24.280 --> 0:00:29.440
Alright folks, welcome to Responsible Clouds and the Green Web Triangle.

7
0:00:29.440 --> 0:00:34.240
How to make the climate place for a diverse cloud ecosystem.

8
0:00:34.240 --> 0:00:39.700
I work for the greenwebfoundation.org and the URL for that non-profit is written across

9
0:00:39.700 --> 0:00:43.040
the bottom of this screen as you can see.

10
0:00:43.040 --> 0:00:46.960
In case you can't see me, that's my face.

11
0:00:46.960 --> 0:00:50.400
This is a bit of a hangover from when you're doing remote talks because, yeah, it's weird

12
0:00:50.400 --> 0:00:53.960
being in a room with other people again.

13
0:00:53.960 --> 0:00:59.000
I have a background working in wacky environmental climate tech startups like, as you can see,

14
0:00:59.000 --> 0:01:04.800
Loco2, which is a triple layer pun around locomotion, low carbon and like going to local

15
0:01:04.800 --> 0:01:06.760
on a crazy holiday.

16
0:01:06.760 --> 0:01:10.840
I also work at a company called AMI, which stands for Avoid Mass Extinction Engine.

17
0:01:10.840 --> 0:01:15.200
We burn through something in the region of 20 million US dollars of VC money trying to

18
0:01:15.200 --> 0:01:18.760
put a carbon footprint API on anything we could find.

19
0:01:18.760 --> 0:01:23.480
These days, I work at the greenwebfoundation where we track the transition of the internet

20
0:01:23.480 --> 0:01:25.600
away from fossil fuels to something greener.

21
0:01:25.600 --> 0:01:30.600
I also work with the green software foundation, which is a large industry body where I'm the

22
0:01:30.600 --> 0:01:32.520
policy chair there.

23
0:01:32.520 --> 0:01:37.360
I also run a podcast, a co-host of podcasts called Environment Variables, get it?

24
0:01:37.360 --> 0:01:39.520
Which is all about green software.

25
0:01:39.520 --> 0:01:45.320
I also am a contributing editor to a magazine called Branch Magazine, which is all about

26
0:01:45.320 --> 0:01:48.920
the stuff, this kind of intersection between climate and tech.

27
0:01:48.920 --> 0:01:50.440
This is what we're going to cover today.

28
0:01:50.440 --> 0:01:54.800
I'm going to frame a kind of problem that you might think about when it comes to sovereign

29
0:01:54.800 --> 0:01:57.480
tech, sovereign cloud and sustainability.

30
0:01:57.480 --> 0:02:02.320
I'm going to talk a little bit about the drivers for sustainability at a regulatory level that

31
0:02:02.320 --> 0:02:04.080
happen in Europe specifically.

32
0:02:04.080 --> 0:02:09.920
Then I'm going to talk about the idea of competing on transparency as a basis for a more diverse

33
0:02:09.920 --> 0:02:12.000
cloud ecosystem.

34
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:18.640
Off we go, framing the cloud, framing the problem with the green web triangle.

35
0:02:18.640 --> 0:02:24.200
Most of you know that we basically build services by compiling them these days of lots of different

36
0:02:24.200 --> 0:02:25.200
processes.

37
0:02:25.200 --> 0:02:28.800
It's a bit like a kind of graph where things people see at the top is actually comprised

38
0:02:28.800 --> 0:02:33.560
of all these things that we might build all the way through that.

39
0:02:33.560 --> 0:02:39.760
When you're trying to actually use a service, you kind of end up with this kind of problem.

40
0:02:39.760 --> 0:02:44.400
If you want to make a service available to other people, or if you want to use a service,

41
0:02:44.400 --> 0:02:47.240
there are kind of like three things you want, in my opinion.

42
0:02:47.240 --> 0:02:51.040
You want something to be convenient, ideally hosted by someone else a lot of the time,

43
0:02:51.040 --> 0:02:54.160
or at least so you don't have to be doing it all yourself if you're a kind of medium

44
0:02:54.160 --> 0:02:55.780
to small size company.

45
0:02:55.780 --> 0:02:59.040
You probably want it to be fossil free because there's a whole kind of climate emergency

46
0:02:59.040 --> 0:03:01.200
thing going on.

47
0:03:01.200 --> 0:03:05.340
Ideally you'd like it to be kind of diverse, so you're not dependent on only one provider

48
0:03:05.340 --> 0:03:10.080
who can jack up their prices or do all kinds of things that bad things happen when you're

49
0:03:10.080 --> 0:03:12.960
only relying on one provider.

50
0:03:12.960 --> 0:03:18.240
You basically have, I think there are different failure modes when you think about this triangle

51
0:03:18.240 --> 0:03:20.920
because most of the time you can only pick two.

52
0:03:20.920 --> 0:03:24.760
So for example, let's say you wanted to go for convenient and diverse.

53
0:03:24.760 --> 0:03:28.400
This is like the common thing that a lot of us kind of default to.

54
0:03:28.400 --> 0:03:32.320
It's basically the default, it's fossil fuel powered.

55
0:03:32.320 --> 0:03:37.240
It's a bit like being in a spaceship that you know is on fire and then you go to work

56
0:03:37.240 --> 0:03:40.240
and you type in a keyboard and you know things are on fire.

57
0:03:40.240 --> 0:03:43.120
Then you go home and you realize things are on fire.

58
0:03:43.120 --> 0:03:47.320
Then you feel kind of a little bit anxious, unlike people call that climate anxiety.

59
0:03:47.320 --> 0:03:50.880
That's one of the things that some of you might feel when you think about this.

60
0:03:50.880 --> 0:03:53.320
On a kind of global scale, there's an issue there.

61
0:03:53.320 --> 0:03:57.040
So that's the thing that we probably are in right now that we don't want to do all the

62
0:03:57.040 --> 0:03:58.040
time.

63
0:03:58.040 --> 0:03:59.880
The other one is diverse and fossil free.

64
0:03:59.880 --> 0:04:04.160
Maybe you do care about this and you're going to look for, say, green providers, but you

65
0:04:04.160 --> 0:04:08.280
also care about having diverse ecosystems and building everything yourself.

66
0:04:08.280 --> 0:04:11.920
This is cool, but it kind of has another failure mode in that you spend loads and loads of

67
0:04:11.920 --> 0:04:16.960
time on undifferentiated heavy lifting, which isn't necessarily creating the kind of value

68
0:04:16.960 --> 0:04:20.080
that you're basically employed for a lot of the time.

69
0:04:20.080 --> 0:04:25.360
Or alternatively, you can go for convenient and fossil free because lots and lots of large

70
0:04:25.360 --> 0:04:31.280
companies now, like say Microsoft and Amazon and Google, are telling a really, really loud

71
0:04:31.280 --> 0:04:36.120
story about how much they're really kind of running on green energy and doing a load for

72
0:04:36.120 --> 0:04:37.320
the climate.

73
0:04:37.320 --> 0:04:42.960
Now there are kind of all kinds of problems, which I'm in a sovereign cloud dev room where

74
0:04:42.960 --> 0:04:45.160
I don't need to kind of talk too much about.

75
0:04:45.160 --> 0:04:49.920
But there is also issues because these folks tend to be the people who are often the market

76
0:04:49.920 --> 0:04:54.120
leaders in helping people get oil and gas out of the ground and burn it.

77
0:04:54.120 --> 0:04:59.080
So even if you're running on, say, green software, like they may be doing things which you might

78
0:04:59.080 --> 0:05:05.180
not be aligned with as an organization or you might feel somewhat uncomfortable about.

79
0:05:05.180 --> 0:05:06.680
So these are the three ways.

80
0:05:06.680 --> 0:05:09.960
This is the triangle and these are the kind of common failure modes that I think that

81
0:05:09.960 --> 0:05:15.680
are useful to talk to other people about and how I explain the problem with basically sustainable

82
0:05:15.680 --> 0:05:20.160
digital diverse services to people who want to actually make a switch and start using

83
0:05:20.160 --> 0:05:25.500
something which is not necessarily a number of really large providers but don't understand

84
0:05:25.500 --> 0:05:28.940
why you can't just move to like next cloud for everything.

85
0:05:28.940 --> 0:05:31.240
So that's like the problem, that's the triangle.

86
0:05:31.240 --> 0:05:36.240
Now let's talk about the drivers for sustainability in tech at regulatory level that might kind

87
0:05:36.240 --> 0:05:37.920
of help for some of this.

88
0:05:37.920 --> 0:05:44.020
So this graph is from Dr. Robert Rode from Berkeley Earth, which is an environmental

89
0:05:44.020 --> 0:05:48.200
data science nonprofit and they're using data from the Global Carbon Project.

90
0:05:48.200 --> 0:05:53.440
And what you can see is historically, like we've been growing in emissions however long,

91
0:05:53.440 --> 0:05:58.520
and you can see this trajectory which people might refer to as business as usual.

92
0:05:58.520 --> 0:06:03.280
There's lots of different scenarios and it's actually titled SSP2.

93
0:06:03.280 --> 0:06:04.920
There's a bunch of these.

94
0:06:04.920 --> 0:06:08.480
Then you see the kind of changes we would need to actually make to get down to like

95
0:06:08.480 --> 0:06:14.960
1.5 degrees of global warming, which is considered like the least worst option that you'll typically

96
0:06:14.960 --> 0:06:16.480
see a lot of the time.

97
0:06:16.480 --> 0:06:23.320
And this is, you might have heard like 1.5 versus or 2 degrees for example.

98
0:06:23.320 --> 0:06:28.000
Like in 2015, pretty much every country on earth agreed that we should probably do something

99
0:06:28.000 --> 0:06:32.000
about climate and we should go for not more than 2 degrees of warming.

100
0:06:32.000 --> 0:06:36.240
And then they actually, you had a bunch of people say well actually 2 degrees is still

101
0:06:36.240 --> 0:06:41.200
pretty bad and then we did a bunch of research and found out that yes, 1.5 is what we should

102
0:06:41.200 --> 0:06:43.280
be thinking about naturally.

103
0:06:43.280 --> 0:06:48.880
And despite that, we've actually had people thinking okay, well what does that mean for

104
0:06:48.880 --> 0:06:51.520
us as a sector, as a technology sector?

105
0:06:51.520 --> 0:06:58.960
And in 2020, you had a bunch of digital and sustainability focused organizations trying

106
0:06:58.960 --> 0:07:02.000
to figure out what that would mean for us as a sector.

107
0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:05.800
Like how would we need to kind of drop our emissions for example?

108
0:07:05.800 --> 0:07:09.360
And as you can see, this quote that came out when it was issued from this press release

109
0:07:09.360 --> 0:07:14.000
basically said yeah, to actually have the Paris Agreement which is less ambitious than

110
0:07:14.000 --> 0:07:19.760
that 1.5 thing, they basically said you need to halve emissions by 20, you need to reduce

111
0:07:19.760 --> 0:07:23.400
emissions by 45% by 2030 in 7 years' time.

112
0:07:23.400 --> 0:07:29.600
So that's basically making a reduction of around 7% each year, year on year and well

113
0:07:29.600 --> 0:07:34.200
we haven't really been reducing things by 7% each year so it's actually going to be

114
0:07:34.200 --> 0:07:35.200
larger.

115
0:07:35.200 --> 0:07:38.400
So this is basically what the science is spelling out for us.

116
0:07:38.400 --> 0:07:42.720
The thing that's quite interesting this year is that you've had people talking about net

117
0:07:42.720 --> 0:07:46.600
zero for a while but now people are starting to actually say well what does net zero really

118
0:07:46.600 --> 0:07:49.560
mean in the context of this science actually?

119
0:07:49.560 --> 0:07:51.680
And has anyone heard of the ISO here?

120
0:07:51.680 --> 0:07:54.080
ISO, the standards folks?

121
0:07:54.080 --> 0:07:56.960
Okay they come up with something really interesting that they published in November.

122
0:07:56.960 --> 0:08:01.320
They basically said if you want to call something net zero, you actually need to have some teeth

123
0:08:01.320 --> 0:08:03.960
behind it and need to actually mean something now.

124
0:08:03.960 --> 0:08:07.760
So while there's been lots and lots of kind of green washing net zero targets and things

125
0:08:07.760 --> 0:08:11.880
from those organisations, they've basically come out and said actually this is the kind

126
0:08:11.880 --> 0:08:13.920
of stuff you need for net zero now.

127
0:08:13.920 --> 0:08:19.800
And they've basically said if you have net zero claims by 2050 without having about anything

128
0:08:19.800 --> 0:08:23.120
related to halving emissions by 2030, they're not credible.

129
0:08:23.120 --> 0:08:26.080
If you don't include your supply chain, do you just only think about your own things

130
0:08:26.080 --> 0:08:30.120
rather than like who made a computer or anything like that, not credible.

131
0:08:30.120 --> 0:08:34.680
And also if you don't have any interim targets in the next few years, also not credible because

132
0:08:34.680 --> 0:08:39.480
this is quite important because seven years is about the same time as the average tenure

133
0:08:39.480 --> 0:08:44.320
for a CEO which basically means you can say oh we're going to be net zero, leave, then

134
0:08:44.320 --> 0:08:46.200
it's someone else's problem to solve.

135
0:08:46.200 --> 0:08:49.200
And this is then basically saying actually you need to have something now so you can't

136
0:08:49.200 --> 0:08:51.320
do that kind of stuff.

137
0:08:51.320 --> 0:08:55.680
What's also interesting in Europe specifically is the catch-all titled European Corporate

138
0:08:55.680 --> 0:08:58.280
Sustainability Reporting Directive.

139
0:08:58.280 --> 0:09:04.440
Basically if you were in a company which has more than 250 employees, you need to be recording

140
0:09:04.440 --> 0:09:08.600
and reporting some information about what your carbon emissions look like.

141
0:09:08.600 --> 0:09:13.880
And you need to start reporting in 2024 which means you need to be reporting two months

142
0:09:13.880 --> 0:09:16.240
ago to start doing this.

143
0:09:16.240 --> 0:09:21.840
So that is interesting because lots and lots of organizations don't even have a sustainability

144
0:09:21.840 --> 0:09:24.720
team and don't even know how to start reporting this stuff.

145
0:09:24.720 --> 0:09:30.240
And then finally the IFRS, sorry about all the acronyms, these folks are, you can think

146
0:09:30.240 --> 0:09:32.960
of them as like the Pope of accounting.

147
0:09:32.960 --> 0:09:37.720
They're the people who just basically set a decree which everyone then follows in accounting

148
0:09:37.720 --> 0:09:38.720
land.

149
0:09:38.720 --> 0:09:42.400
They've basically said that supply chain thing that people talk about, yeah, actually we

150
0:09:42.400 --> 0:09:47.080
should be doing that and you can't just say about your own organization rather than all

151
0:09:47.080 --> 0:09:50.820
the things you buy from other people for example.

152
0:09:50.820 --> 0:09:53.160
So that's what people have been saying and how are we doing so far?

153
0:09:53.160 --> 0:09:55.040
Like as a tech sector, right?

154
0:09:55.040 --> 0:09:57.360
So there's good news and there's bad news, all right?

155
0:09:57.360 --> 0:10:03.520
The good news is that well, we have seen lots and lots of use and more people are connected

156
0:10:03.520 --> 0:10:07.600
to the internet which I think is in broadly speaking a good thing and I don't know about

157
0:10:07.600 --> 0:10:11.360
you folks but I quite liked having access to the internet during the pandemic.

158
0:10:11.360 --> 0:10:15.520
I think that's been more useful and it would be a lot more kind of lonely and sad and cold

159
0:10:15.520 --> 0:10:18.720
and everything if I wasn't connected to that.

160
0:10:18.720 --> 0:10:23.200
And you generally see that we've basically been using much, much more in the way of digital

161
0:10:23.200 --> 0:10:28.720
services over the last say 10 years or so but the growth hasn't been that large really.

162
0:10:28.720 --> 0:10:32.760
It hasn't been proportional and there's a number of reasons for this.

163
0:10:32.760 --> 0:10:36.600
Let's, okay, we can just, can we just not talk about cryptocurrency?

164
0:10:36.600 --> 0:10:41.120
I'm sorry, like it's not helping billions of people, right?

165
0:10:41.120 --> 0:10:44.200
The two billion people who joined the internet, pretty sure it didn't help two billion people.

166
0:10:44.200 --> 0:10:48.760
Yeah, it's using like about half the impact, half the energy of all the data centers on

167
0:10:48.760 --> 0:10:49.760
Earth, all right?

168
0:10:49.760 --> 0:10:50.960
So that's the thing.

169
0:10:50.960 --> 0:10:54.560
So we're basically going in the direction which is not ideal at the moment and we need

170
0:10:54.560 --> 0:10:56.600
to kind of be reducing this.

171
0:10:56.600 --> 0:11:01.280
And I guess there are now some companies which are trying to step up on this and they're

172
0:11:01.280 --> 0:11:05.600
trying to basically say, well, we want to keep growing which has issues of its own but

173
0:11:05.600 --> 0:11:08.680
maybe one thing we can do is actually make the energy we use greener.

174
0:11:08.680 --> 0:11:13.720
So you now see very, very large companies like say Google say, well, 2030 is an important

175
0:11:13.720 --> 0:11:14.720
date.

176
0:11:14.720 --> 0:11:19.000
We're going to make sure that all of our energy is running on all the energy we use is coming

177
0:11:19.000 --> 0:11:25.400
from green sources 24 seven and 24 seven is important because okay, you know how like

178
0:11:25.400 --> 0:11:30.000
you bill for cloud like an hourly basis and there's about maybe 9000 hours in a year.

179
0:11:30.000 --> 0:11:31.000
Yeah.

180
0:11:31.000 --> 0:11:32.000
All right.

181
0:11:32.000 --> 0:11:34.000
Normally when you look at green energy and people say I'm running on green energy, it's

182
0:11:34.000 --> 0:11:39.320
an, it's like an average basically saying for all the power I've used, if I've used maybe

183
0:11:39.320 --> 0:11:45.400
actually the way that I describe it to people is like this.

184
0:11:45.400 --> 0:11:48.880
We all know that we should probably get about eight hours of sleep, right?

185
0:11:48.880 --> 0:11:49.880
Yeah.

186
0:11:49.880 --> 0:11:52.480
Like a, or a route that in a 24 hour period.

187
0:11:52.480 --> 0:11:57.760
And if I wanted when you normally have green energy right now, you can basically say, well,

188
0:11:57.760 --> 0:12:02.480
I've, it's a bit like me saying, I know I need to get eight hours of sleep every night

189
0:12:02.480 --> 0:12:03.640
and I've got a year.

190
0:12:03.640 --> 0:12:08.160
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to have 3000 hours of sleep at the beginning of the

191
0:12:08.160 --> 0:12:09.160
year.

192
0:12:09.160 --> 0:12:10.160
All right.

193
0:12:10.160 --> 0:12:13.680
And then I'm just going to run on Red Bull and chocolate bars for the rest of the year.

194
0:12:13.680 --> 0:12:15.080
And that's going to be sustainable.

195
0:12:15.080 --> 0:12:16.760
That's kind of like annual energy balancing.

196
0:12:16.760 --> 0:12:19.760
That's kind of what the accounting is kind of a bit like, and there's more to it than

197
0:12:19.760 --> 0:12:20.760
that.

198
0:12:20.760 --> 0:12:23.000
But like, that's what we currently have at the moment, which is why 24 seven is actually

199
0:12:23.000 --> 0:12:25.920
allowed upon quite an important goal.

200
0:12:25.920 --> 0:12:26.920
Microsoft is also doing this.

201
0:12:26.920 --> 0:12:31.920
They've said, well, they're going to run a hundred percent, a hundred percent zero coming

202
0:12:31.920 --> 0:12:35.240
with zero carbon purchases, which again, sounds kind of cool.

203
0:12:35.240 --> 0:12:38.440
And like these are companies with almost infinite money.

204
0:12:38.440 --> 0:12:43.240
I say almost because they use as a basis for firing lots and lots of people despite being

205
0:12:43.240 --> 0:12:45.760
through really, really profitable still.

206
0:12:45.760 --> 0:12:51.120
But there are turns out that actually you don't need to be a ginormous company with

207
0:12:51.120 --> 0:12:54.200
infinite money to actually kind of set this kind of target and actually be moving this

208
0:12:54.200 --> 0:12:55.200
quickly.

209
0:12:55.200 --> 0:12:57.960
This is a peninsula, the clean energy.

210
0:12:57.960 --> 0:12:59.280
They're based in California.

211
0:12:59.280 --> 0:13:03.440
They're a small community choice aggregator, which is basically a bit like a nonprofit

212
0:13:03.440 --> 0:13:04.440
energy company.

213
0:13:04.440 --> 0:13:09.200
And they've said, well, actually we think we can do it by 2025 because we built the

214
0:13:09.200 --> 0:13:16.640
idea of avoiding an absolute climate kind of crisis into our governance board, basically.

215
0:13:16.640 --> 0:13:20.840
And we, if it makes us slightly less profitable, that's okay because we're not answering to

216
0:13:20.840 --> 0:13:21.840
shareholders.

217
0:13:21.840 --> 0:13:22.840
So they've showed that they can do that.

218
0:13:22.840 --> 0:13:27.040
And they've also actually shared all the actual underlying model in Python to show how they

219
0:13:27.040 --> 0:13:28.920
actually bought all this stuff as well.

220
0:13:28.920 --> 0:13:31.680
So you can actually do this.

221
0:13:31.680 --> 0:13:35.760
And there's something interesting in Europe that's happened in the last week, actually.

222
0:13:35.760 --> 0:13:40.240
Do you know how Elon Musk did that whole thing where he just cut off API access to Twitter

223
0:13:40.240 --> 0:13:43.840
and then everyone's like, oh, now this thing I was going to do and like a massive enough

224
0:13:43.840 --> 0:13:47.520
start using now because I should be using and I meant to do it anyway, right?

225
0:13:47.520 --> 0:13:50.520
There's this kind of idea that you get ran to it.

226
0:13:50.520 --> 0:13:53.260
Kind of the same thing happened with fossil fuels in Europe, right?

227
0:13:53.260 --> 0:13:57.280
So we basically had this idea where Europe has been using loads of fossil fuels from

228
0:13:57.280 --> 0:13:58.280
Russia.

229
0:13:58.280 --> 0:14:01.360
And then Russia basically switched off the pipe.

230
0:14:01.360 --> 0:14:06.240
And now you basically see press releases like this saying, well, we've got off Russian gas,

231
0:14:06.240 --> 0:14:07.240
folks.

232
0:14:07.240 --> 0:14:10.160
And now we've got all this money we can spend on that we would have otherwise spent on fossil

233
0:14:10.160 --> 0:14:11.160
fuels.

234
0:14:11.160 --> 0:14:13.560
So it's a bit like lemon and making lemonade.

235
0:14:13.560 --> 0:14:18.560
But basically the upshot is that you basically got the European Commission president and

236
0:14:18.560 --> 0:14:22.960
the people who essentially run Europe saying, well, we've got a quarter of a trillion euros

237
0:14:22.960 --> 0:14:24.160
that we would have spent on gas.

238
0:14:24.160 --> 0:14:27.960
And now we're planning to spend it on kind of more cool things like net zero technology

239
0:14:27.960 --> 0:14:33.680
and wind and solar and stuff, which I think is actually, well, I'll take it, I suppose,

240
0:14:33.680 --> 0:14:34.680
right?

241
0:14:34.680 --> 0:14:37.120
So that's kind of what's happening at a kind of regulatory level that I think is quite

242
0:14:37.120 --> 0:14:38.120
interesting.

243
0:14:38.120 --> 0:14:42.400
And anyway, let's talk about competing on transparency for a diverse cloud ecosystem

244
0:14:42.400 --> 0:14:47.680
because the thing is we basically have the science telling us we need to reduce emissions.

245
0:14:47.680 --> 0:14:51.200
And there are ways of, there are some organizations which start saying, yeah, we're making all

246
0:14:51.200 --> 0:14:53.600
this, we're doing all this kind of big splashy stuff.

247
0:14:53.600 --> 0:14:57.520
And it's turning out there's more in the way of resources to do this stuff.

248
0:14:57.520 --> 0:15:02.160
And there is this kind of narrative in policy circles right now where all the innovation

249
0:15:02.160 --> 0:15:04.400
has to come from very, very large companies.

250
0:15:04.400 --> 0:15:09.160
And I think it's not really true, particularly in like, well, basic cloud, for example, there's

251
0:15:09.160 --> 0:15:13.160
low all kinds of cool stuff that you see from small providers in Europe, for example.

252
0:15:13.160 --> 0:15:17.560
So OVH cloud pioneers in say, liquid cooling and service, as you can see here.

253
0:15:17.560 --> 0:15:22.240
And then we're doing it for ages, scale way, like a French cloud provider using ARM service

254
0:15:22.240 --> 0:15:23.240
for ages as well.

255
0:15:23.240 --> 0:15:26.600
Like this is the thing that people make a big thing of, but it's been like just standard

256
0:15:26.600 --> 0:15:31.800
as well as, okay, adiabatic cooling is basically using some ideas first developed in Iran to

257
0:15:31.800 --> 0:15:35.160
basically reduce the use of water, but still make things cool.

258
0:15:35.160 --> 0:15:38.120
They basically use it inside their servers rather than drawing loads and loads of water

259
0:15:38.120 --> 0:15:40.380
out of like the local kind of aquifers.

260
0:15:40.380 --> 0:15:44.760
This is important because in some parts of the world, there are Google data centers which

261
0:15:44.760 --> 0:15:48.800
use the same amount of water as the city they're in, basically.

262
0:15:48.800 --> 0:15:51.040
So like, you should be caring about this kind of stuff.

263
0:15:51.040 --> 0:15:53.040
And anyway, there's loads of other examples that I've listed here.

264
0:15:53.040 --> 0:15:55.620
I'm sure you can read them as well.

265
0:15:55.620 --> 0:15:59.520
And there's also an interest at a kind of regulatory or kind of public sector level

266
0:15:59.520 --> 0:16:03.640
now where people are trying to actually figure out what sustainable software really looks

267
0:16:03.640 --> 0:16:06.840
like and how do you standardize it and how do you procure for this.

268
0:16:06.840 --> 0:16:12.640
So Ocular, which was released by, which was kind of celebrated by KDE recently, they have

269
0:16:12.640 --> 0:16:18.360
the first kind of Blau angle, Blue Angel kind of sustainable software kind of certificate,

270
0:16:18.360 --> 0:16:22.760
which was issued to Ocular, a PDF reader around September last year.

271
0:16:22.760 --> 0:16:26.280
And this is interesting because this is the kind of stuff that people who spend money

272
0:16:26.280 --> 0:16:30.640
on trying to actually procure green and actually buy green in digital services are actually

273
0:16:30.640 --> 0:16:32.080
getting now.

274
0:16:32.080 --> 0:16:37.520
And if you work in a company and you're using some of the large providers, this is important

275
0:16:37.520 --> 0:16:41.320
because it turns out to be quite difficult to get the metrics from the very, very big

276
0:16:41.320 --> 0:16:42.560
hyperscalers.

277
0:16:42.560 --> 0:16:47.400
This is an actual A table from a person called Mark Butcher at Positive Cloud.

278
0:16:47.400 --> 0:16:50.420
He shared some of this with me because he was trying to figure out, well, okay, if you're

279
0:16:50.420 --> 0:16:55.120
using these big providers, what information can you get from them when they're in your

280
0:16:55.120 --> 0:16:57.480
supply chain that you need to report against?

281
0:16:57.480 --> 0:17:01.960
And well, basically, I won't go into all the details here, but the red stuff is bad, right?

282
0:17:01.960 --> 0:17:06.260
So if you're using the stuff on like those two providers, not really a good one.

283
0:17:06.260 --> 0:17:09.200
Even on the left hand side, you do see some information.

284
0:17:09.200 --> 0:17:13.980
So Microsoft is probably one of the better ones right now, but there's still some questions

285
0:17:13.980 --> 0:17:15.400
about what they report.

286
0:17:15.400 --> 0:17:21.800
Amazon, the level of reporting they give you is so, so, so low resolution that you can't

287
0:17:21.800 --> 0:17:25.880
tell if the emissions are coming from like one data center or another data center, which

288
0:17:25.880 --> 0:17:28.780
is on the other side of the country, thousands of miles away.

289
0:17:28.780 --> 0:17:32.800
So you have some issues here because you might have one data center running essentially on

290
0:17:32.800 --> 0:17:36.820
coal and you have another data center running on hydropower, which is definitely cleaner

291
0:17:36.820 --> 0:17:38.360
than coal, all right?

292
0:17:38.360 --> 0:17:39.360
And you have all this stuff here.

293
0:17:39.360 --> 0:17:42.200
And this is one thing that you don't really have access to that if you're going to try

294
0:17:42.200 --> 0:17:45.360
and report, if you need to report, you're going to have to be able to figure out how

295
0:17:45.360 --> 0:17:49.200
to actually get these numbers so you can see if you're making, if we're going up or if

296
0:17:49.200 --> 0:17:51.440
you're going down like we saw before.

297
0:17:51.440 --> 0:17:55.080
There's also loads of really cool open source tooling, which makes it possible to get these

298
0:17:55.080 --> 0:17:56.160
numbers out.

299
0:17:56.160 --> 0:17:59.460
So the most well-known one is Cloud Carbon Footprint.

300
0:17:59.460 --> 0:18:00.920
This is maintained by ThoughtWorks.

301
0:18:00.920 --> 0:18:05.560
It plugs into billing APIs from, say, Amazon, from Microsoft and Google.

302
0:18:05.560 --> 0:18:10.200
Then they do some guesstimates based on available data to tell you what your figures might be

303
0:18:10.200 --> 0:18:14.680
because the various cloud providers have their own native ones, which have very different

304
0:18:14.680 --> 0:18:19.720
assumptions to the open ones that you can challenge and you can ask questions about.

305
0:18:19.720 --> 0:18:21.680
Green Coding Metrics, they did a talk today.

306
0:18:21.680 --> 0:18:25.600
They basically put, if you have a digital service, they'll put every single service

307
0:18:25.600 --> 0:18:29.160
in a kind of docker container, then track the energy used.

308
0:18:29.160 --> 0:18:33.160
And I've got a really nerdy kind of part of a talk at 5 o'clock later today where I talk

309
0:18:33.160 --> 0:18:34.160
about some of that.

310
0:18:34.160 --> 0:18:37.200
Scaffandre, I'm not going to pronounce that properly.

311
0:18:37.200 --> 0:18:41.200
It's a French word for diving helmet or diving suit.

312
0:18:41.200 --> 0:18:45.680
It basically gives you process-level energy usage metrics from any machine you run it

313
0:18:45.680 --> 0:18:47.760
on if you have access to the bare metal.

314
0:18:47.760 --> 0:18:51.640
And it spits this out that you can kind of put into like dashboards and Grafana.

315
0:18:51.640 --> 0:18:56.640
Kepler does more or less the same thing, but for Kubernetes, using Berkeley, no, Extended

316
0:18:56.640 --> 0:18:57.640
Berkeley packet filters.

317
0:18:57.640 --> 0:18:59.240
That's what they're called, right?

318
0:18:59.240 --> 0:19:00.240
Yeah.

319
0:19:00.240 --> 0:19:01.240
So that's another thing they do.

320
0:19:01.240 --> 0:19:03.920
And there's another talk again about that kind of stuff.

321
0:19:03.920 --> 0:19:07.160
So there's all this stuff which you can use and plug into your tooling, or you can ask

322
0:19:07.160 --> 0:19:08.160
people to use.

323
0:19:08.160 --> 0:19:11.600
So you can actually get the numbers to show that you're kind of putting this in the right

324
0:19:11.600 --> 0:19:12.600
direction if you're interested in.

325
0:19:12.600 --> 0:19:13.600
And I think that's my time.

326
0:19:13.600 --> 0:19:14.600
I'm just going to wrap up.

327
0:19:14.600 --> 0:19:17.000
That was a green web triangle.

328
0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:18.320
There are three things you can have.

329
0:19:18.320 --> 0:19:19.680
Convenient, diverse, fossil-free.

330
0:19:19.680 --> 0:19:23.160
Most of the time, you can only really pick two.

331
0:19:23.160 --> 0:19:26.960
There's pressure right now to really push towards fossil-free being a key thing, which

332
0:19:26.960 --> 0:19:29.280
then really makes you decide, am I going to be diverse?

333
0:19:29.280 --> 0:19:30.520
Am I going to be fossil-free?

334
0:19:30.520 --> 0:19:33.400
I mean, the other one, convenient.

335
0:19:33.400 --> 0:19:34.400
You can compete on transparency.

336
0:19:34.400 --> 0:19:39.240
And I think this is some area that you could actually really kind of lead on.

337
0:19:39.240 --> 0:19:45.360
And I think this is actually a way that this is probably underexplored right now.

338
0:19:45.360 --> 0:19:48.480
And finally, diverse ecosystems are healthy ecosystems.

339
0:19:48.480 --> 0:19:51.800
There's policy support, and there's money, and there's funding to make this stuff possible.

340
0:19:51.800 --> 0:19:53.400
And I think you should do it.

341
0:19:53.400 --> 0:19:56.800
And I think that there's actually even a policy idea around this.

342
0:19:56.800 --> 0:19:59.200
The kind of words you need to use is twin transitions.

343
0:19:59.200 --> 0:20:03.560
That's the kind of pseudo-password you need to use when you speak into a policymaker.

344
0:20:03.560 --> 0:20:04.560
And I think that's it.

345
0:20:04.560 --> 0:20:05.560
Thanks, folks, for my time.

346
0:20:05.560 --> 0:20:08.040
There's a talk about a fossil-free internet.

347
0:20:08.040 --> 0:20:10.440
This talk is online with links to everything I showed you.

348
0:20:10.440 --> 0:20:11.440
I'm on mastodon.social.

349
0:20:11.440 --> 0:20:15.920
And, OK, there's probably Mr. Chris Adams on Twitter, but I don't really use it very

350
0:20:15.920 --> 0:20:16.920
much.

351
0:20:16.920 --> 0:20:18.520
But you're welcome to tweet there, I suppose.

352
0:20:18.520 --> 0:20:19.520
And yeah, that's my email address.

353
0:20:19.520 --> 0:20:20.520
Thank you, everyone.

354
0:20:20.520 --> 0:20:21.520
Thank you.

355
0:20:21.520 --> 0:20:22.520
Thank you, Chris.

356
0:20:22.520 --> 0:20:23.520
Open for questions?

357
0:20:23.520 --> 0:20:24.520
Yes.

358
0:20:24.520 --> 0:20:35.880
I'm also in the element matrix thing-o, so if you've got a question there, I'll try and

359
0:20:35.880 --> 0:20:37.880
answer it as well.

360
0:20:37.880 --> 0:20:40.400
There we go.

361
0:20:40.400 --> 0:20:41.880
Well, hello.

362
0:20:41.880 --> 0:20:47.880
I suppose I waited for some serious questions, but I have one maybe weird one.

363
0:20:47.880 --> 0:20:52.400
What do you think about low-Earth orbit data centers?

364
0:20:52.400 --> 0:20:56.320
You've talked about data centers in space that beam things down.

365
0:20:56.320 --> 0:20:58.920
Yes, exactly.

366
0:20:58.920 --> 0:21:05.280
I think there...

367
0:21:05.280 --> 0:21:08.760
If there was a way that you could get them into space without the rockets, and you can't

368
0:21:08.760 --> 0:21:09.760
have...

369
0:21:09.760 --> 0:21:11.760
There are actually some wacky ways to do that.

370
0:21:11.760 --> 0:21:12.760
I think it'd be cool.

371
0:21:12.760 --> 0:21:16.760
I think astronomers have really strong opinions about that.

372
0:21:16.760 --> 0:21:21.760
And also, the whole idea of, like, privatization of space makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable,

373
0:21:21.760 --> 0:21:23.960
because we're not great at dealing with our waste right now.

374
0:21:23.960 --> 0:21:28.560
And if you have all the waste that stops other people trans, then I feel like that's maybe

375
0:21:28.560 --> 0:21:30.800
not the ideal solution, basically.

376
0:21:30.800 --> 0:21:35.440
Also, a little bit worried about having the guy in charge of Twitter, in charge of the

377
0:21:35.440 --> 0:21:36.960
future of space.

378
0:21:36.960 --> 0:21:41.880
Maybe let's look at how he's handling Twitter, and think we want to see where that goes.

379
0:21:41.880 --> 0:21:43.520
I'm not sure about that.

380
0:21:43.520 --> 0:21:49.360
That's my answer, I suppose, but probably not related to climate.

381
0:21:49.360 --> 0:21:50.360
Anyone else?

382
0:21:50.360 --> 0:22:06.360
Hi, I just wanted to ask, what can you do as a small company, 10 to 15 people, you are

383
0:22:06.360 --> 0:22:11.360
developing software probably for bigger clients?

384
0:22:11.360 --> 0:22:15.120
I think what you can do, you can write into your contract.

385
0:22:15.120 --> 0:22:18.920
Actually, there's a website called the Chance Relaying Project, which has all these clauses

386
0:22:18.920 --> 0:22:21.200
for working with larger companies.

387
0:22:21.200 --> 0:22:28.200
You can also allocate some of the revenue, 1.5% of my revenue, for 1.5% of us being alive,

388
0:22:28.200 --> 0:22:33.240
and then use that to allocate that to fund things, either internally making your own

389
0:22:33.240 --> 0:22:37.800
organization greener, or by funding things like non-profit groups who are actually pushing

390
0:22:37.800 --> 0:22:39.080
for policy change.

391
0:22:39.080 --> 0:22:40.080
Stuff like that.

392
0:22:40.080 --> 0:22:43.760
I think those are the things you could do, which are easy to write into a contract, which

393
0:22:43.760 --> 0:22:47.640
would actually show that you were demonstrating leadership compared to other people.

394
0:22:47.640 --> 0:22:49.760
This is also what we do in terms of training and consulting.

395
0:22:49.760 --> 0:22:54.080
I'm very happy to chat about that, because I probably should have told you everyone that.

396
0:22:54.080 --> 0:22:55.080
This is what we do as well.

397
0:22:55.080 --> 0:22:58.800
But yeah, I'm happy to chat about that in more detail, or answer questions on the element

398
0:22:58.800 --> 0:23:03.800
and stuff from that.

399
0:23:03.800 --> 0:23:05.800
Okay.

400
0:23:05.800 --> 0:23:08.800
One more?

401
0:23:08.800 --> 0:23:10.800
Yeah.

402
0:23:10.800 --> 0:23:12.920
Hi, thank you.

403
0:23:12.920 --> 0:23:17.560
You showed a few list of tools that help you get energy.

404
0:23:17.560 --> 0:23:18.560
This one?

405
0:23:18.560 --> 0:23:19.560
Yes.

406
0:23:19.560 --> 0:23:26.280
How precise are they, and how much do they go around?

407
0:23:26.280 --> 0:23:31.160
How many assumptions do they make to get the numbers, and what would be needed to don't

408
0:23:31.160 --> 0:23:32.560
make assumptions at all?

409
0:23:32.560 --> 0:23:33.560
Okay.

410
0:23:33.560 --> 0:23:35.560
Someone mentioned Ili before, didn't they?

411
0:23:35.560 --> 0:23:37.560
Ili was one of the German cloud providers.

412
0:23:37.560 --> 0:23:41.800
Sorry, not cloud provider, energy provider.

413
0:23:41.800 --> 0:23:46.280
All we need to do is get carbon emission figures from the energy providers, so they can tell

414
0:23:46.280 --> 0:23:49.400
you how dirty or clean the energy is at any moment in time.

415
0:23:49.400 --> 0:23:50.400
So you need that.

416
0:23:50.400 --> 0:23:52.400
Basically, Scaffronger is very, very, very good.

417
0:23:52.400 --> 0:23:54.560
It gives you very, very good numbers.

418
0:23:54.560 --> 0:23:58.960
But you need hardware support to actually share the information about this.

419
0:23:58.960 --> 0:24:03.480
So Intel, they have something called RAPL, which is running average power limit, which

420
0:24:03.480 --> 0:24:08.460
gives you idea of the energy used by the CPU, but not necessarily the GPU or the disk.

421
0:24:08.460 --> 0:24:12.560
So you need all this stuff kind of instrumented for you to get this.

422
0:24:12.560 --> 0:24:17.280
Kepler, because you're going into the kernel, you can get really, really, really detailed

423
0:24:17.280 --> 0:24:18.280
information.

424
0:24:18.280 --> 0:24:23.520
But I'm kind of out of my league here, because I can write docs, but I can't write Rust,

425
0:24:23.520 --> 0:24:29.560
which is why I contributed docs to Scaffronger instead of Rust to Scaffronger.

426
0:24:29.560 --> 0:24:30.680
Grid coding metrics.

427
0:24:30.680 --> 0:24:35.600
There's also a talk online where Arna Tarara, he talks about this in really, really good

428
0:24:35.600 --> 0:24:38.400
detail, and he's actually very, very knowledgeable.

429
0:24:38.400 --> 0:24:41.520
About carbon footprint, everything is open source, and it's all in TypeScript, where

430
0:24:41.520 --> 0:24:45.560
they are very explicit about the assumptions they make all along, and they're also open

431
0:24:45.560 --> 0:24:46.560
to pull requests.

432
0:24:46.560 --> 0:24:51.400
I've committed to code to that one, and, yeah, I haven't committed code to the other two,

433
0:24:51.400 --> 0:24:54.480
but they're cool people, and I really support the projects.

434
0:24:54.480 --> 0:24:58.840
I hope that helps, and I'm, again, happy to chat in more detail.

435
0:24:58.840 --> 0:24:59.840
Thank you.

436
0:24:59.840 --> 0:25:00.840
Cool, folks.

437
0:25:00.840 --> 0:25:01.840
Thank you.

438
0:25:01.840 --> 0:25:02.840
Thank you.

439
0:25:02.840 --> 0:25:03.840
Thank you.

440
0:25:03.840 --> 0:25:04.840
Thank you.

441
0:25:04.840 --> 0:25:05.840
Thank you.

442
0:25:05.840 --> 0:25:06.840
Thank you.

443
0:25:06.840 --> 0:25:07.840
Thank you.

444
0:25:07.840 --> 0:25:08.840
Thank you.

445
0:25:08.840 --> 0:25:37.660
