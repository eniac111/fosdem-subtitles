1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.520
So, welcome to the second talk of today in the sovereign cloud def room.

2
0:00:11.520 --> 0:00:16.200
And I'm very happy that Peter, founder of Pecona, is with us.

3
0:00:16.200 --> 0:00:18.400
And this is now your stage, Peter.

4
0:00:18.400 --> 0:00:19.400
Welcome.

5
0:00:19.400 --> 0:00:20.400
Okay.

6
0:00:20.400 --> 0:00:21.400
Thank you.

7
0:00:21.400 --> 0:00:22.400
Thank you.

8
0:00:22.400 --> 0:00:23.400
Oh, one.

9
0:00:23.400 --> 0:00:24.400
That's fantastic.

10
0:00:24.400 --> 0:00:25.400
Okay.

11
0:00:25.400 --> 0:00:29.960
Well, so we're going to talk today.

12
0:00:29.960 --> 0:00:39.000
And about wonderful topic of open source and its relationship with the cloud.

13
0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:44.120
Now, I think most of you don't know me.

14
0:00:44.120 --> 0:00:48.980
And I thought I would highlight my perspective first, right?

15
0:00:48.980 --> 0:00:54.080
So you can understand maybe where I'm coming from better.

16
0:00:54.080 --> 0:01:03.040
Myself, I was involved in open source since late 90s, which now seems like a long time

17
0:01:03.040 --> 0:01:04.040
ago.

18
0:01:04.040 --> 0:01:10.440
I was at that time building my first startup back in Russia.

19
0:01:10.440 --> 0:01:16.800
And I took unconventional decision to use open source rather than stealing property

20
0:01:16.800 --> 0:01:24.400
software, which was the most conventional thing to do in Russia in late 90s.

21
0:01:24.400 --> 0:01:30.800
Afterwards, I joined MySQL AB before Oracle, before Sunmet.

22
0:01:30.800 --> 0:01:34.720
That was like a tiny company without 40 people.

23
0:01:34.720 --> 0:01:43.120
And that's where I got a lot of exposure in building and sort of promoting open source.

24
0:01:43.120 --> 0:01:50.640
And I also was their founder and until recently CEO of Percona, a company which specializes

25
0:01:50.640 --> 0:01:55.160
in open source databases, right?

26
0:01:55.160 --> 0:01:59.760
And we release all our software as open source.

27
0:01:59.760 --> 0:02:05.000
And since that time, I was also involved as advisor, mentor, investor, in some case, in

28
0:02:05.000 --> 0:02:12.320
various companies around open source space, right?

29
0:02:12.320 --> 0:02:18.880
If you want to summarize all that kind of presentation, a couple of words, would be

30
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:19.880
probably this, right?

31
0:02:19.880 --> 0:02:24.720
I believe what everything being equal, open source is a better choice, right?

32
0:02:24.720 --> 0:02:27.600
Of course, you tell me it's never everything equal.

33
0:02:27.600 --> 0:02:32.560
But then I think this second thing applies, right?

34
0:02:32.560 --> 0:02:41.040
I think as a member of community, employee, right, maybe manager of a company, it is always

35
0:02:41.040 --> 0:02:48.280
better for you long term to invest your time, invest your resources into the open source

36
0:02:48.280 --> 0:02:55.240
rather than just send that to some, you know, proprietary vendor, right, which will provide

37
0:02:55.240 --> 0:03:00.040
more value to them than to you.

38
0:03:00.040 --> 0:03:05.200
Now one thing to understand about open source is that the open source takes time.

39
0:03:05.200 --> 0:03:14.360
This is a slide I shamelessly stole from a talk from Bruce with his last name, nobody

40
0:03:14.360 --> 0:03:17.280
can pronounce, so I won't ever try it, right?

41
0:03:17.280 --> 0:03:24.800
But this is the Bruce in PostgreSQL community, right, who often talks about PostgreSQL and

42
0:03:24.800 --> 0:03:29.800
open source, and he uses this chart which says, hey, you know what, if you look at compared

43
0:03:29.800 --> 0:03:38.240
to the property software, open source tend to take a long time, right, because if you

44
0:03:38.240 --> 0:03:46.120
think about saying, hey, you know what, I get one kind of, you know, get a small team

45
0:03:46.120 --> 0:03:50.320
together, you know, fund them and say, hey, build this, they can do it faster compared

46
0:03:50.320 --> 0:03:56.880
to open source, which is kind of a lot more organic fluid, a lot more discussions, you

47
0:03:56.880 --> 0:04:04.200
know, a lot more, you know, people operate maybe on a volunteer basis, each takes time,

48
0:04:04.200 --> 0:04:13.360
but then over time it overtakes the property software according to many criteria in many

49
0:04:13.360 --> 0:04:15.040
areas.

50
0:04:15.040 --> 0:04:22.360
And as example which I would use is this, like Linux and Solaris.

51
0:04:22.360 --> 0:04:30.840
When I was getting started with open source, I have a lot of friends which were running

52
0:04:30.840 --> 0:04:26.620
a real unique super-

53
0:04:26.620 --> 0:04:38.440
ration system, you know, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, anybody remember those?

54
0:04:38.440 --> 0:04:45.960
Right, and they would think like, well, Linux, that is a toy, right, that's like a 32-bit

55
0:04:45.960 --> 0:04:52.200
super-ration system at that time, doesn't handle, you know, multiple CPUs, well, you

56
0:04:52.200 --> 0:04:58.640
could not even at the time have a file more than 2 gigabytes in size, right, I mean, you

57
0:04:58.640 --> 0:05:05.920
know, like sounds like a joke, right, and right for if so, but well, where are we here

58
0:05:05.920 --> 0:05:12.240
now, right, I mean, how many of you guys still run in HPUX, anyone?

59
0:05:12.240 --> 0:05:17.440
No, like, AIX, Solaris probably, maybe there should be one or two people, no?

60
0:05:17.440 --> 0:05:18.440
No Solaris folks?

61
0:05:18.440 --> 0:05:25.880
Well, we can see what over time Linux, if it's kind of slow and messy at times, development

62
0:05:25.880 --> 0:05:35.240
progress, right, really overtook that there are other operating systems, right, especially

63
0:05:35.240 --> 0:05:43.320
if you look at the server side, right, then Linux is well-dominated.

64
0:05:43.320 --> 0:05:49.160
Now we can also look, if you look at the cloud, we can see another comparison here, right,

65
0:05:49.160 --> 0:05:57.320
I remember also back in those early 90s, where folks would be using, you know, ASP.NET with

66
0:05:57.320 --> 0:06:03.960
Windows stacks, and wow, it is so fantastic, if you graphical user interfaces, whatever,

67
0:06:03.960 --> 0:06:14.320
to us open source folks who would be coding, you know, PHP or Perl in VI, right, or Emacs,

68
0:06:14.320 --> 0:06:22.520
right, if you are from the other camp, right, in that time, right, which was very different,

69
0:06:22.520 --> 0:06:30.000
right, but if you look at how things developed right now, now we have a fantastic development

70
0:06:30.000 --> 0:06:38.800
framework, right, very efficient for many open source frameworks, right, that things

71
0:06:38.800 --> 0:06:39.800
evolve.

72
0:06:39.800 --> 0:06:44.120
Now, at the same time, if you look at the cloud standpoint, we are kind of in a similar

73
0:06:44.120 --> 0:06:45.360
situation.

74
0:06:45.360 --> 0:06:53.000
You can even go to this kind of very polished, integrated, yada, yada, but very proprietary

75
0:06:53.000 --> 0:07:01.440
stacks which Amazon or many other proprietary huge cloud vendors are ready to provide you,

76
0:07:01.440 --> 0:07:09.240
right, or you can have open source solutions which are not yet as polished, powerful, integrated,

77
0:07:09.240 --> 0:07:17.800
and so on and so forth, right, but I believe, well, they are going to get there.

78
0:07:17.800 --> 0:07:23.320
Now what I want at this point to talk a little bit more about where we are now in kind of

79
0:07:23.320 --> 0:07:28.600
a state of ecosystem, what is happening and what the trends are.

80
0:07:28.600 --> 0:07:35.080
One, if you think about relationship with clouds and open source, you can say, well,

81
0:07:35.080 --> 0:07:43.400
from one side, the cloud vendors have been making the open source a lot easier for other

82
0:07:43.400 --> 0:07:44.400
people, right?

83
0:07:44.400 --> 0:07:50.400
And if you look at deploying some open source technology, especially it applies, I would

84
0:07:50.400 --> 0:07:56.480
say, to the databases, it's much easier to get, let's say, Postgres running in a cloud

85
0:07:56.480 --> 0:08:04.080
vendor compared to getting your kind of, well, you know, highly available, monitored backup

86
0:08:04.080 --> 0:08:10.160
for a Postgres cluster on virtual machines, right?

87
0:08:10.160 --> 0:08:16.240
But on the other hand, we can also see all those cloud vendors use this kind of an old

88
0:08:16.240 --> 0:08:22.200
strategy, which actually they used even before the cloud, which is called Embrace, Extend,

89
0:08:22.200 --> 0:08:23.800
Extinguish, right?

90
0:08:23.800 --> 0:08:28.280
And what that means is, hey, you know, why don't we take the open source, we make it

91
0:08:28.280 --> 0:08:30.800
fancier?

92
0:08:30.800 --> 0:08:35.760
Fancy may mean more features like in a database space, well, where I come from would be something

93
0:08:35.760 --> 0:08:37.520
like Amazon Aurora.

94
0:08:37.520 --> 0:08:41.720
It's wonderful, there are those kind of additional features, better performance, wherever, or

95
0:08:41.720 --> 0:08:47.360
maybe more usable, maybe there's like a fancy GUI, so you can deploy it with a couple of

96
0:08:47.360 --> 0:08:48.360
clicks, right?

97
0:08:48.360 --> 0:08:55.080
Instead of, oh, I have to put some elbow grease, right, to do it the open source way, but then,

98
0:08:55.080 --> 0:09:01.000
yes, you go there and you kind of check in in the Hotel California, right?

99
0:09:01.000 --> 0:09:09.560
Which if you know the song, you can't really ever leave, leave again, right?

100
0:09:09.560 --> 0:09:14.040
Now what I think in this case, it's important to understand and for all of us as open source

101
0:09:14.040 --> 0:09:20.280
developers to recognize what really the usability and ease of view is increasingly becoming

102
0:09:20.280 --> 0:09:26.880
that is a new frontier of the competition, right?

103
0:09:26.880 --> 0:09:34.480
And I think that is especially hard maybe for people for my generation, which got used

104
0:09:34.480 --> 0:09:37.800
to that very kind of hairy open source, right?

105
0:09:37.800 --> 0:09:42.480
At that time, we remember, you know, compiling open source from source, right?

106
0:09:42.480 --> 0:09:45.880
And kind of we have all that skills, right?

107
0:09:45.880 --> 0:09:53.880
But if you think what is happening right now in a software industry in general, as well

108
0:09:53.880 --> 0:10:02.040
in open source is this, one is a software just, you know, absolutely explodes in amount,

109
0:10:02.040 --> 0:10:03.040
right?

110
0:10:03.040 --> 0:10:05.280
Everything is software those days, right?

111
0:10:05.280 --> 0:10:09.800
Amount of software which is being written will need to be written, need to be maintained,

112
0:10:09.800 --> 0:10:16.040
extend, and so on and so forth is, you know, absolutely amazing and growing every year.

113
0:10:16.040 --> 0:10:17.600
The same happens with data, right?

114
0:10:17.600 --> 0:10:23.120
We're having more and more data and more and more ways to process and whatever that data

115
0:10:23.120 --> 0:10:26.160
for good and for evil, right?

116
0:10:26.160 --> 0:10:36.360
But at the same time, we are have to do that with less and especially with skills, right?

117
0:10:36.360 --> 0:10:44.200
You can see as a software engineer and technology industry as well, we have a lot of people

118
0:10:44.200 --> 0:10:51.880
getting in that stuff which are not going to really be able to debug Linux kernel code,

119
0:10:51.880 --> 0:10:59.080
right, to, you know, have some, you know, just obvious basic skills, right?

120
0:10:59.080 --> 0:11:10.560
Well, for them, you need to build a software which is easier to use.

121
0:11:10.560 --> 0:11:16.640
The fact I think what is very interesting is what we can see increasingly some expert,

122
0:11:16.640 --> 0:11:25.520
even in related to open source technologies which actually only have cloud specific skills,

123
0:11:25.520 --> 0:11:26.520
right?

124
0:11:26.520 --> 0:11:31.560
Well, especially in the US, right, I think adoption of a cloud is substantially forward

125
0:11:31.560 --> 0:11:32.560
on, right?

126
0:11:32.560 --> 0:11:37.800
You may have somebody saying, you know, I am, you know, post-gres-ql expert, right?

127
0:11:37.800 --> 0:11:39.440
And you talk to them what that means.

128
0:11:39.440 --> 0:11:46.760
He is very capable of provisioning, you know, post-gres-ql aurora on AWS with two clicks,

129
0:11:46.760 --> 0:11:47.760
right?

130
0:11:47.760 --> 0:11:49.160
But you say, like, well, you know what, what is patroni?

131
0:11:49.160 --> 0:11:50.160
You say, what?

132
0:11:50.160 --> 0:11:51.160
What?

133
0:11:51.160 --> 0:11:56.920
Well, that's like some high-availability solution for post-gres, right, if you guys don't know,

134
0:11:56.920 --> 0:11:57.920
right?

135
0:11:57.920 --> 0:12:02.640
Which is very basic.

136
0:12:02.640 --> 0:12:11.160
I think another interesting thing is what, especially in the large corporation standpoint,

137
0:12:11.160 --> 0:12:15.800
a lot of them run to build their businesses by the book, right?

138
0:12:15.800 --> 0:12:21.840
So if a management made a choice, what we are adopting, let's say, Amazon cloud or Google

139
0:12:21.840 --> 0:12:27.360
cloud, Azure doesn't matter, they often then would come to them and say, okay, how do we

140
0:12:27.360 --> 0:12:28.360
do that?

141
0:12:28.360 --> 0:12:30.080
Give us the book, right?

142
0:12:30.080 --> 0:12:32.840
And what are those cloud vendors going to tell?

143
0:12:32.840 --> 0:12:37.840
Oh, they're not going to tell you, well, you know what, use our basic services which you

144
0:12:37.840 --> 0:12:39.440
find in the other cloud.

145
0:12:39.440 --> 0:12:46.400
They are going to tell you to use the most proper, advanced, you know, managed solution,

146
0:12:46.400 --> 0:12:47.400
right?

147
0:12:47.400 --> 0:12:52.360
If you read with Amazon, they'll say, hey, you know, go use DynamoDB, right?

148
0:12:52.360 --> 0:12:53.760
It's awesome, right?

149
0:12:53.760 --> 0:13:01.280
Or it's Amazon Aurora, Redshift, all that kind of stuff which makes you the most sticky

150
0:13:01.280 --> 0:13:09.480
for the cloud and which is also providing the most margin to those folks, right?

151
0:13:09.480 --> 0:13:13.960
So what is also interesting in this case, right, if you look for Amazon Aurora, for

152
0:13:13.960 --> 0:13:21.280
example, as they see their customers getting more and more lock-in, the price differential

153
0:13:21.280 --> 0:13:29.160
between their, your computer sources, right, you know, storage, right, and essentially

154
0:13:29.160 --> 0:13:32.920
like in the software, it becoming larger and larger, right?

155
0:13:32.920 --> 0:13:39.360
If every new generation of CPU can actually, you know, find that excuse, right?

156
0:13:39.360 --> 0:13:42.760
So find that changes.

157
0:13:42.760 --> 0:13:49.440
So that means it becomes more and more expensive over time, right?

158
0:13:49.440 --> 0:13:55.280
And also you will see in this environment also really embracing scaling by the credit

159
0:13:55.280 --> 0:13:57.320
card, right?

160
0:13:57.320 --> 0:14:01.120
Because scaling is easy, right?

161
0:14:01.120 --> 0:14:06.600
You don't have to figure out how to run the TAT server you have because getting the next

162
0:14:06.600 --> 0:14:11.440
one would, bigger one would take three months, right, even if you get a budget approved,

163
0:14:11.440 --> 0:14:12.440
right?

164
0:14:12.440 --> 0:14:14.400
Like we used to have like 10, 15 years ago.

165
0:14:14.400 --> 0:14:19.720
Now, you know, screw that optimization skills, right, you can just go to the larger instance

166
0:14:19.720 --> 0:14:24.320
size, right, and that's easy.

167
0:14:24.320 --> 0:14:29.760
And again, like from what we see from a database standpoint, a lot of databases in the cloud

168
0:14:29.760 --> 0:14:36.600
are optimized very poorly exactly because of that trend.

169
0:14:36.600 --> 0:14:42.280
Now what is interesting for me also is how that plays with their venture-funded open

170
0:14:42.280 --> 0:14:48.480
source, which is a lot of open source those days, of course, right?

171
0:14:48.480 --> 0:14:58.960
And what we can see is what they are really for protestions against unfair competition

172
0:14:58.960 --> 0:15:02.040
from a cloud vendors, yada, yada, right?

173
0:15:02.040 --> 0:15:11.640
And many of them abandon open source licenses, right, and go to something else, right, which

174
0:15:11.640 --> 0:15:22.320
is well, really shifting to a proprietary software models.

175
0:15:22.320 --> 0:15:28.360
Now this is, in my opinion, is very different from a community-driven open source, right?

176
0:15:28.360 --> 0:15:33.320
If you think about, well, compare something like PostgreSQL to Mongo, right, which I think

177
0:15:33.320 --> 0:15:50.480
is in the database space very opposite on that kind of open source, the

178
0:15:50.480 --> 0:16:05.200
from a adoption standpoint, right, because cloud made PostgreSQL much easier for a lot

179
0:16:05.200 --> 0:16:06.200
of people, right?

180
0:16:06.200 --> 0:16:09.120
But at the same time, of course, now there are different players which dominate the ecosystem.

181
0:16:09.120 --> 0:16:15.040
Yes, it used to be enterprise DB was the biggest dog, right?

182
0:16:15.040 --> 0:16:17.520
Well now it is probably Amazon, right?

183
0:16:17.520 --> 0:16:21.120
And other cloud vendors make more money, but you know what?

184
0:16:21.120 --> 0:16:27.600
They are hiring a lot of PostgreSQL engineers and investing a lot still to make a PostgreSQL

185
0:16:27.600 --> 0:16:28.600
better.

186
0:16:28.600 --> 0:16:37.440
So at large extent, PostgreSQL community still benefits in this regard.

187
0:16:37.440 --> 0:16:43.600
What also have been interesting for me in the last decade or so is the idea of growth

188
0:16:43.600 --> 0:16:45.460
at any cost, right?

189
0:16:45.460 --> 0:16:50.360
For a lot of companies you can find, well, at least in the US stock market, you know,

190
0:16:50.360 --> 0:16:57.800
the more money company is losing, the better its valuation, right?

191
0:16:57.800 --> 0:17:03.680
As long as you can grow a user base as well, right?

192
0:17:03.680 --> 0:17:09.600
And in this case, you really gravitated saying, how can I grow faster?

193
0:17:09.600 --> 0:17:18.280
That means focus my resources and cloud, which often allows you to, well, things simple,

194
0:17:18.280 --> 0:17:20.120
though expensive, right?

195
0:17:20.120 --> 0:17:24.440
Was very much adopted, right?

196
0:17:24.440 --> 0:17:31.720
And for those companies, often didn't make sense to invest in efficiency, which I think

197
0:17:31.720 --> 0:17:34.360
open source often brings ease, right?

198
0:17:34.360 --> 0:17:39.920
Even though it requires a little bit more investment than elbow grease kind of and management

199
0:17:39.920 --> 0:17:43.520
attention to make those things happen.

200
0:17:43.520 --> 0:17:50.680
Even more though, you can see the cloud has been quite good at giving you your first short

201
0:17:50.680 --> 0:17:53.480
of heroin for free, right?

202
0:17:53.480 --> 0:17:58.160
You can find what every cloud author is saying, hey, oh, you're a startup, great.

203
0:17:58.160 --> 0:18:04.680
We'll give you some big chunk of money so you can spend on us, right?

204
0:18:04.680 --> 0:18:07.600
Or given the free tea, right?

205
0:18:07.600 --> 0:18:09.600
And wherever solution.

206
0:18:09.600 --> 0:18:15.360
Well, but I guess with this analogy, you understand, right?

207
0:18:15.360 --> 0:18:23.120
Well, if somebody giving you a short of heroin for free, they may not always have your best

208
0:18:23.120 --> 0:18:27.120
interest in mind, right?

209
0:18:27.120 --> 0:18:36.680
Now, I think what is interesting is what there are some revelations which are coming, right?

210
0:18:36.680 --> 0:18:40.400
I think in this case, and things are changing.

211
0:18:40.400 --> 0:18:45.120
And I will provide a bunch of links to the detailed articles here, right, which you guys

212
0:18:45.120 --> 0:18:47.560
can check when you saw the cloud.

213
0:18:47.560 --> 0:18:54.000
Like this is interesting from this trillion dollar paradox, right, which talks about,

214
0:18:54.000 --> 0:18:57.360
well, you know what, cloud is damn expensive.

215
0:18:57.360 --> 0:19:04.840
And for many cloud companies, the very large portion of their cost of revenue is actually

216
0:19:04.840 --> 0:19:06.640
cloud spent, right?

217
0:19:06.640 --> 0:19:12.160
So if you are choosing to go with that cloud, especially kind of most expensive persons

218
0:19:12.160 --> 0:19:17.480
on that, well, you know what, you have to be giving up on a lot of potential profit

219
0:19:17.480 --> 0:19:18.800
margin.

220
0:19:18.800 --> 0:19:25.880
Recently, you may also have this 37 signals which talk about while they are leaving the

221
0:19:25.880 --> 0:19:29.640
cloud and they detailed that stuff.

222
0:19:29.640 --> 0:19:32.880
That is also like a very influential company, right?

223
0:19:32.880 --> 0:19:36.520
It's not very big dollar amounts, right, compared to enterprise here.

224
0:19:36.520 --> 0:19:41.280
But I think it's very nice what they kind of went public in this case and say, hey,

225
0:19:41.280 --> 0:19:48.720
guys, even in our scale, even if you spend in maybe, you know, like a less than $10 million

226
0:19:48.720 --> 0:19:55.560
dollars, right, a year on the cloud, it makes sense, right, to actually do things differently,

227
0:19:55.560 --> 0:19:56.560
right?

228
0:19:56.560 --> 0:20:00.800
And $10 million may sound like a lot of money to some of you, but if you look at even kind

229
0:20:00.800 --> 0:20:08.560
of like a mid-size and, well, especially more like logic operations, they often spend hundreds

230
0:20:08.560 --> 0:20:14.840
of millions on dollars on the cloud spend.

231
0:20:14.840 --> 0:20:22.080
Now another trend which I think is interesting, which is coming out, I think is GitOps and

232
0:20:22.080 --> 0:20:30.400
generally the approaches where we have declarative versioned infrastructure as a code approach,

233
0:20:30.400 --> 0:20:31.400
right?

234
0:20:31.400 --> 0:20:37.880
Because when you do that, then often those kind of fancy, gooey point and click I can

235
0:20:37.880 --> 0:20:45.240
do in the cloud is not exactly how you do things anymore, right?

236
0:20:45.240 --> 0:20:51.360
That's where you kind of sort of do it more of a, well, through, you know, API, you know,

237
0:20:51.360 --> 0:20:54.680
command line, if you will, right, things there.

238
0:20:54.680 --> 0:21:01.320
Open source tooling is already better.

239
0:21:01.320 --> 0:21:04.480
Hybrid cloud is another interesting trend, right?

240
0:21:04.480 --> 0:21:11.920
And what I want you to see from this graph is what if you look at the larger the corporation

241
0:21:11.920 --> 0:21:17.760
is, the more of them are embracing the hybrid cloud, right?

242
0:21:17.760 --> 0:21:22.560
That's from the CNCF poll, right?

243
0:21:22.560 --> 0:21:28.880
And if you are using public, if you're using hybrid clouds, multiple cloud vendors, you

244
0:21:28.880 --> 0:21:35.080
know, public and private cloud to give event, you probably do not want to rely too much

245
0:21:35.080 --> 0:21:39.440
on those, you know, property services, right?

246
0:21:39.440 --> 0:21:44.120
Because they tend not to be as portable.

247
0:21:44.120 --> 0:21:51.640
In the end, I think what you are, what we are seeing the open source kind of catches

248
0:21:51.640 --> 0:21:56.180
up again, leaving us with kind of two choices here.

249
0:21:56.180 --> 0:22:00.560
If you look at the AWS, which is obviously the biggest dog where you can replace that

250
0:22:00.560 --> 0:22:02.840
with, you know, Azure, GCP, right?

251
0:22:02.840 --> 0:22:05.800
Or, you know, some other major cloud.

252
0:22:05.800 --> 0:22:10.280
You can really lock in the approach of a cloud vendor, right?

253
0:22:10.280 --> 0:22:20.880
Or you can use their cloud native foundation stack, right, among others, right, where you

254
0:22:20.880 --> 0:22:26.600
are really treating cloud as a commodity and building the value through their open source

255
0:22:26.600 --> 0:22:27.600
software.

256
0:22:27.600 --> 0:22:40.140
What I think is interesting from a cloud native environment is how big it is, right?

257
0:22:40.140 --> 0:22:46.280
You guys probably cannot even see all the logos, right, on the slide, right?

258
0:22:46.280 --> 0:22:48.600
There is a lot out there.

259
0:22:48.600 --> 0:22:52.880
There is typically more than one solution for a single problem, right?

260
0:22:52.880 --> 0:22:58.400
And some of you say, hey, that is too much, but that is also the open source way, right?

261
0:22:58.400 --> 0:23:04.360
In many cases, we need in open source multiple solutions to the same problems, right, which

262
0:23:04.360 --> 0:23:10.240
will kind of evolve, right, and maybe some of you will die off, I will join forces together,

263
0:23:10.240 --> 0:23:14.280
and that is how great stuff happens, right?

264
0:23:14.280 --> 0:23:21.000
But I wanted to show that just to illustrate how much momentum there is behind their open

265
0:23:21.000 --> 0:23:22.800
source approach.

266
0:23:22.800 --> 0:23:32.600
Now, I think in this case, what that allows us is to really, given the proprietary cloud,

267
0:23:32.600 --> 0:23:38.720
it is originally intended role of commodity infrastructure.

268
0:23:38.720 --> 0:23:41.240
Why am I saying originally intended role?

269
0:23:41.240 --> 0:23:47.400
You can see this, this is actually the slide I took from some very old AWS presentation.

270
0:23:47.400 --> 0:23:51.280
Then they were just bringing the cloud to the master's and say, hey, guys, you know

271
0:23:51.280 --> 0:23:52.280
what?

272
0:23:52.280 --> 0:23:55.920
You don't usually run your own generator, right, at home.

273
0:23:55.920 --> 0:23:56.920
It's not convenient.

274
0:23:56.920 --> 0:24:01.760
Well, yes, in some cases it makes sense, but mostly you buy electricity.

275
0:24:01.760 --> 0:24:06.640
So you should buy the same from a cloud when it comes to compute resources, storage, yada,

276
0:24:06.640 --> 0:24:07.640
yada.

277
0:24:07.640 --> 0:24:09.640
It will make sense.

278
0:24:09.640 --> 0:24:13.440
But here is a key difference, right?

279
0:24:13.440 --> 0:24:16.320
If you buy the electricity, it is commodity.

280
0:24:16.320 --> 0:24:24.440
You can buy the electricity from a variety of vendors or make your own, and you're still

281
0:24:24.440 --> 0:24:26.080
all appliances going to work.

282
0:24:26.080 --> 0:24:33.520
You don't have to change your TV or your fridge if you're doing the other electricity, right?

283
0:24:33.520 --> 0:24:37.040
And that is kind of what a lot of cloud vendors want us to do, right?

284
0:24:37.040 --> 0:24:41.880
Well, we'll provide you commodity thing, right, electricity, but you know what?

285
0:24:41.880 --> 0:24:46.800
We also really want you to use those appliances which will only work with our kind of electricity.

286
0:24:46.800 --> 0:24:52.120
Well, that sounds like bullshit to me.

287
0:24:52.120 --> 0:25:00.640
So with this, I think we have really two choices, right, how we can approach those, the cloud,

288
0:25:00.640 --> 0:25:04.240
which I will call as the cloud of software on account of freedom.

289
0:25:04.240 --> 0:25:11.440
One is to use a lot of property features of your cloud vendors, sell your soul to the

290
0:25:11.440 --> 0:25:13.960
devil, right, and all the other stuff, right?

291
0:25:13.960 --> 0:25:14.960
So let's vote.

292
0:25:14.960 --> 0:25:17.600
How many one is going to use that way?

293
0:25:17.600 --> 0:25:19.600
Any hands out there?

294
0:25:19.600 --> 0:25:20.600
No?

295
0:25:20.600 --> 0:25:21.600
No?

296
0:25:21.600 --> 0:25:25.240
I would surprise, I would accept there's some people working for Amazon here on some,

297
0:25:25.240 --> 0:25:27.240
I would say, yeah.

298
0:25:27.240 --> 0:25:28.560
Yes, yes, okay.

299
0:25:28.560 --> 0:25:34.040
And then we can use cloud of freedom, which is saying, well, cloud vendors are fine.

300
0:25:34.040 --> 0:25:39.880
It's like a good commodity infrastructure providers like the internet providers, right,

301
0:25:39.880 --> 0:25:45.120
just give us those commodity resources and we will build the rest of the stuff using

302
0:25:45.120 --> 0:25:46.120
open source.

303
0:25:46.120 --> 0:25:49.480
How many of you think that a good idea?

304
0:25:49.480 --> 0:25:53.160
Okay, okay, that's better.

305
0:25:53.160 --> 0:26:02.720
Okay, now in this regard, what I think is a very good API in this regard?

306
0:26:02.720 --> 0:26:08.400
Well, it is there, the Kubernetes, right?

307
0:26:08.400 --> 0:26:12.600
I would not say that Kubernetes is absolutely perfect.

308
0:26:12.600 --> 0:26:17.960
It's not, but I think what every successful open source project started as a piece of

309
0:26:17.960 --> 0:26:18.960
crap, right?

310
0:26:18.960 --> 0:26:21.440
I mean, it's just how things go, right?

311
0:26:21.440 --> 0:26:28.840
Because you build successful open source projects not having a solid technical foundation despite

312
0:26:28.840 --> 0:26:37.040
what engineers want to believe, but building the movement, building the ecosystem, right?

313
0:26:37.040 --> 0:26:45.800
And then those ecosystems, right, well, is able to redo the code, right, mistakes, wherever

314
0:26:45.800 --> 0:26:48.600
and to build something, right?

315
0:26:48.600 --> 0:26:51.320
With Kubernetes example, I remember there was messes.

316
0:26:51.320 --> 0:26:53.520
Anybody remember messes?

317
0:26:53.520 --> 0:26:57.600
Well, that was a very cool project, right?

318
0:26:57.600 --> 0:27:02.680
I remember talking to those girls and they have, let's say five years ago, a lot of very

319
0:27:02.680 --> 0:27:06.200
cool things which Kubernetes did not have, but you know what?

320
0:27:06.200 --> 0:27:09.000
They lost adoption game.

321
0:27:09.000 --> 0:27:17.880
And now you can see with things like I have next, oh, no, sorry, next, their container

322
0:27:17.880 --> 0:27:19.640
storage interface and some other stuff.

323
0:27:19.640 --> 0:27:20.640
Hey, you know what?

324
0:27:20.640 --> 0:27:27.520
Kubernetes is getting a lot better for data intensive applications, right, not just for

325
0:27:27.520 --> 0:27:33.800
this narrow use case of stateless applications it was originally designed.

326
0:27:33.800 --> 0:27:41.120
We also now have either the data on Kubernetes community, right, which is a special community

327
0:27:41.120 --> 0:27:48.040
which is focused on running data intensive applications on Kubernetes, right?

328
0:27:48.040 --> 0:27:56.960
And what is interesting in this case from also the CNCF survey, we can actually see

329
0:27:56.960 --> 0:28:03.160
what from 2001 to 2002 the databases, right?

330
0:28:03.160 --> 0:28:11.480
So something which is technically was not something you would ever think to run on Kubernetes

331
0:28:11.480 --> 0:28:18.320
five years ago is one of the fastest growing application type which is being run on Kubernetes

332
0:28:18.320 --> 0:28:20.600
those days.

333
0:28:20.600 --> 0:28:29.760
Now I would say even more, what we see right now is if you look at a lot of modern independent

334
0:28:29.760 --> 0:28:33.720
database as a service providers, am I right?

335
0:28:33.720 --> 0:28:38.960
All of those folks, they are actually using Kubernetes on the back end to build their

336
0:28:38.960 --> 0:28:40.880
database as a service solution.

337
0:28:40.880 --> 0:28:47.640
You may not know that, you may not care, but they are doing that and that means for them

338
0:28:47.640 --> 0:28:54.320
well that is both efficient way to build it, operate it and that can be run, you know,

339
0:28:54.320 --> 0:28:59.240
stable enough like at least with a good skill.

340
0:28:59.240 --> 0:29:08.280
Another interesting result what's going on with Kubernetes is what we are having, well,

341
0:29:08.280 --> 0:29:13.000
despite having Kubernetes already quite ubiquitous, right?

342
0:29:13.000 --> 0:29:20.120
Hey, you can run it on pretty much any cloud if you look at many, you know, every distribution,

343
0:29:20.120 --> 0:29:26.400
a little distribution now have their own Kubernetes destroyed, at least a major one, right?

344
0:29:26.400 --> 0:29:35.680
You steal Kubernetes from VMware, right, and many other solutions right now, right?

345
0:29:35.680 --> 0:29:42.040
But we are also having Kubernetes come into other places like I like this K3S solution

346
0:29:42.040 --> 0:29:52.240
which is lightweight, Kubernetes, right, which you can deploy on the age IoT devices, right,

347
0:29:52.240 --> 0:29:58.000
or if you just have, you know, couple of servers in your basement that you want to run Kubernetes

348
0:29:58.000 --> 0:29:59.000
on.

349
0:29:59.000 --> 0:30:06.920
We also are getting more solutions for visual kids, right, because if you look at, you know,

350
0:30:06.920 --> 0:30:13.280
like a ROC Kubernetes you often would be seeing that, you know, console and YAML files, right,

351
0:30:13.280 --> 0:30:14.280
and everything.

352
0:30:14.280 --> 0:30:20.840
But now we are also have a pretty good dashboard which comes with Kubernetes, a Skibernetes

353
0:30:20.840 --> 0:30:31.880
project, and as well integrations with applications, like there are solutions like kubep apps or

354
0:30:31.880 --> 0:30:37.080
Rancher application catalog, right, you can say, hey, you know, if I am running Kubernetes

355
0:30:37.080 --> 0:30:46.160
I can deploy open source and appropriate applications on my Kubernetes solution in a couple of clicks.

356
0:30:46.160 --> 0:30:57.320
Kind of similar to what we see now in their major clouds, right, where we have their marketplaces.

357
0:30:57.320 --> 0:30:58.640
Okay.

358
0:30:58.640 --> 0:31:09.880
So, with that, where do I think things need to be going and will be going next as we are

359
0:31:09.880 --> 0:31:14.080
getting more and more open source software in a cloud?

360
0:31:14.080 --> 0:31:20.160
One, we still need to continue working on the better integrations because I think that

361
0:31:20.160 --> 0:31:24.440
is the name of the game right now, right.

362
0:31:24.440 --> 0:31:31.240
We expect really all the software and the software and hardware to be very well integrated

363
0:31:31.240 --> 0:31:37.040
with each other, right, and that is something where I think a lot of property vendors put

364
0:31:37.040 --> 0:31:44.360
a lot of folks in, right, because if it is not easy to make two things work together,

365
0:31:44.360 --> 0:31:49.800
then for majority of the people it would not be accessible because remember what we spoke

366
0:31:49.800 --> 0:31:50.960
about?

367
0:31:50.960 --> 0:31:57.280
A lot of people do not have very advanced skills those days.

368
0:31:57.280 --> 0:32:01.080
Related thing, of course, is the better usability, right.

369
0:32:01.080 --> 0:32:09.760
I mean, we have expectations of usability very high, attention span very low, right.

370
0:32:09.760 --> 0:32:15.960
I mean, I am not sure if any of you have like teenage kids or am I just too old here, you

371
0:32:15.960 --> 0:32:16.960
know.

372
0:32:16.960 --> 0:32:19.160
What do you think about the attention span those days?

373
0:32:19.160 --> 0:32:20.160
Okay.

374
0:32:20.160 --> 0:32:26.800
Well, and remember, right, those teenagers are probably already doing some work with

375
0:32:26.800 --> 0:32:33.000
computers, right, you know, it is often taught as a middle school those days, some programming

376
0:32:33.000 --> 0:32:38.360
skills, right, and they will be going in the industry in the next few years.

377
0:32:38.360 --> 0:32:44.880
And the last thing I would mention and that is again maybe comes from my database background,

378
0:32:44.880 --> 0:32:51.080
right, is making sure we also have a good experience if at day two operations, not just

379
0:32:51.080 --> 0:32:52.080
day one.

380
0:32:52.080 --> 0:32:57.440
In very many cases I see there is a lot of application catalogs and where ever say hey,

381
0:32:57.440 --> 0:33:02.200
look at that, you can develop that application very quickly, right, but then if you really

382
0:33:02.200 --> 0:33:06.280
want to maintain that, it is like, you know, with database you can't just, you know, tear

383
0:33:06.280 --> 0:33:08.480
it apart and deploy a new one.

384
0:33:08.480 --> 0:33:17.520
Well that is something which can become instantly quite complicated, right, if it is not handled

385
0:33:17.520 --> 0:33:18.520
well.

386
0:33:18.520 --> 0:33:26.400
Well, with that, I will end with my call to action, pretty much saying what I started,

387
0:33:26.400 --> 0:33:34.240
right, I would encourage you to embrace the open source in the cloud, also invest both

388
0:33:34.240 --> 0:33:40.400
in terms of your personal time and efforts and as well motivating your company to invest

389
0:33:40.400 --> 0:33:49.520
in making it better because open source very much depends on our collective effort, right,

390
0:33:49.520 --> 0:33:56.760
for its success and of course spread the world, that is how the movement grows.

391
0:33:56.760 --> 0:34:06.000
Well with that, it is all ahead and I would be happy to answer some questions.

392
0:34:06.000 --> 0:34:27.120
Thank you very much for your talk.

393
0:34:27.120 --> 0:34:32.560
You said in your final slide that people should be investing in open source and invest in

394
0:34:32.560 --> 0:34:33.560
making it better.

395
0:34:33.560 --> 0:34:39.240
What are your thoughts on the new kind of trend you see of organisations like the sovereign

396
0:34:39.240 --> 0:34:44.640
tech fund in Germany allocating millions to open source projects and things like that?

397
0:34:44.640 --> 0:34:48.360
Where do you think the money should come from rather than, or is there a structured way

398
0:34:48.360 --> 0:34:50.200
it should actually be allocated?

399
0:34:50.200 --> 0:34:56.000
Well, so where should money come from, right, from open source?

400
0:34:56.000 --> 0:35:00.400
Well look, I think that is a variety of things, right.

401
0:35:00.400 --> 0:35:05.720
I think if you look in this case like from the government standpoint, right, it is classically

402
0:35:05.720 --> 0:35:12.920
have been supporting, you know, public good with investment in research, right, the medicine,

403
0:35:12.920 --> 0:35:20.560
right, wherever, like I think that open source is one of such ways how you can create a lot

404
0:35:20.560 --> 0:35:24.760
of public good, right, which is wonderful.

405
0:35:24.760 --> 0:35:31.360
I think though in many cases probably where majority can come from, right, these are the

406
0:35:31.360 --> 0:35:35.840
public corporations, I don't know what probably private corporations, right, acting out of

407
0:35:35.840 --> 0:35:38.040
their own interest, right.

408
0:35:38.040 --> 0:35:43.480
I think in this case we all need to also work with that kind of like mentality change, right,

409
0:35:43.480 --> 0:35:48.640
because you see like for years, right, even before like a Microsoft changed it and became

410
0:35:48.640 --> 0:35:55.400
like all, you know, we love open source kind of company, right, it was all about like oh

411
0:35:55.400 --> 0:36:00.280
open source is evil, it's like, you know, communists run open source, right, that's

412
0:36:00.280 --> 0:36:07.480
how you, you know, lose all your, you know, property, right, open source is insecure,

413
0:36:07.480 --> 0:36:11.840
yada, yada, yada, right, and I think that is something there that's kind of spread the

414
0:36:11.840 --> 0:36:18.720
word is important, right, is to make sure well that is actually none of those things,

415
0:36:18.720 --> 0:36:25.400
right, and really embrace an open source and the focus on the real open source can be very

416
0:36:25.400 --> 0:36:32.160
good long term ROI for a corporation, so maybe not a short term, right, but the long term,

417
0:36:32.160 --> 0:36:33.160
right.

418
0:36:33.160 --> 0:36:37.080
Well in this case I probably want to mention one other thing which I think is still challenge

419
0:36:37.080 --> 0:36:38.400
those days, right.

420
0:36:38.400 --> 0:36:45.360
I think what the open source term is being bastardized, right, we can see many companies

421
0:36:45.360 --> 0:36:50.720
they try to say oh our software is kind of almost as good as open source, right, and

422
0:36:50.720 --> 0:36:58.960
but then they put you like well some very specially restrictive licenses, right, in

423
0:36:58.960 --> 0:37:04.040
this case, right, and we need, right, or have like an open core when you have like a crippled

424
0:37:04.040 --> 0:37:10.960
open source, right, and real property software and we need to make sure the company understand

425
0:37:10.960 --> 0:37:22.000
where is what is open source, right, and focus on growing that compared to those, well, others.

426
0:37:22.000 --> 0:37:23.920
Make sense?

427
0:37:23.920 --> 0:37:24.920
Thank you.

428
0:37:24.920 --> 0:37:30.000
Hello, thank you for the presentation.

429
0:37:30.000 --> 0:37:36.560
In the beginning we started with a good willingness to make it very portable to other cloud and

430
0:37:36.560 --> 0:37:42.440
that kind of stuff having the deployment that can be multi-cloud and we missed something

431
0:37:42.440 --> 0:37:49.360
because at some point the experts that were there to help us were pushing for some proprietary

432
0:37:49.360 --> 0:37:56.000
or non-compatible deployment and we are totally stuck now in one cloud provider.

433
0:37:56.000 --> 0:38:02.080
How do you manage such a risk and what would you put as a rule set at the beginning so

434
0:38:02.080 --> 0:38:04.080
that you would not fall in that pitfall?

435
0:38:04.080 --> 0:38:08.080
Yeah, well I think that's a very question, I can say hey we made a mistake and now we

436
0:38:08.080 --> 0:38:16.280
are stuck, right, well, I think in this case, right, if you're looking at portability, right,

437
0:38:16.280 --> 0:38:23.280
I think it's important what that portability is being tested, right, so in your case, right,

438
0:38:23.280 --> 0:38:30.000
maybe you say hey we are mostly around that one cloud vendor and we want to be able to

439
0:38:30.000 --> 0:38:35.440
move to other cloud vendor if we need, well that means what you need to regularly test

440
0:38:35.440 --> 0:38:40.720
your software that actually works on that cloud vendor so if incompatibility and over

441
0:38:40.720 --> 0:38:45.800
reliance is introduced you can instantly squash that because if you don't do it, right, then

442
0:38:45.800 --> 0:38:50.040
you know like three years later, right, then you finally want to do that you can say oh

443
0:38:50.040 --> 0:38:56.360
my gosh, it actually turns out so much the things what we did not do, right, and I think

444
0:38:56.360 --> 0:39:05.200
in many cases what is also important is what developers do not read docs, right, they tinker,

445
0:39:05.200 --> 0:39:10.920
right, and often then you think like oh I'm using this kind of feature, right, in this

446
0:39:10.920 --> 0:39:16.400
case I assume it works everywhere but maybe they are actually, you know, using something

447
0:39:16.400 --> 0:39:22.400
which only works in this particular place, right, that is why testing is important, you

448
0:39:22.400 --> 0:39:28.320
cannot rely on, you know, the developers, right, infrastructure engineers just, you

449
0:39:28.320 --> 0:39:36.160
know, using their subset they are supposed to be using.

450
0:39:36.160 --> 0:39:50.720
Okay, well, thank you.

451
0:39:50.720 --> 0:39:52.760
Hi, thank you.

452
0:39:52.760 --> 0:40:00.600
When we have some companies using proprietary cloud provider, we, it is difficult for us

453
0:40:00.600 --> 0:40:11.760
to say that they need to move all their infrastructure as you just said, so is it a problem of offer,

454
0:40:11.760 --> 0:40:19.640
it is a problem of the free software cloud provider offer to provide some easy tools

455
0:40:19.640 --> 0:40:27.120
to use or it is really a problem of politics from the companies to say that yeah, we should

456
0:40:27.120 --> 0:40:34.320
go to the difficult but free software, how do we manage with that?

457
0:40:34.320 --> 0:40:40.600
Well, I mean, you're asking like is that like a technical question, right, or is it politics,

458
0:40:40.600 --> 0:40:46.280
right, and the question is both, right, in this case, like yes, I mean if you look from

459
0:40:46.280 --> 0:40:53.480
a technical standpoint I think there easier is if open source software where more is going

460
0:40:53.480 --> 0:41:00.600
to be, you know, easy to convince, adopt, right, and so on and so forth, but in many

461
0:41:00.600 --> 0:41:08.600
cases it is possible, it is also like a politics, right, because there are, can be some entrenched

462
0:41:08.600 --> 0:41:12.480
interest for whatever reasons, right, or some belief, right.

463
0:41:12.480 --> 0:41:17.160
I have seen a number of companies in my works, right, where people say oh my gosh, we are

464
0:41:17.160 --> 0:41:23.280
running on, let's say that like a Microsoft stack, there is no freaking way it's possible

465
0:41:23.280 --> 0:41:28.880
we move to open source, yada, yada, yada, yada, right, and then we have a new CTO, right,

466
0:41:28.880 --> 0:41:34.320
and boom, right, you can say in a few years, right, like more than half of workloads are

467
0:41:34.320 --> 0:41:40.200
moved to the, you know, to the different open source solution, right.

468
0:41:40.200 --> 0:41:46.520
So I think in this case, like if you look at what is a primary thing, right, it is politics

469
0:41:46.520 --> 0:41:58.800
and desire of a management, right, that is always a primary thing.

470
0:41:58.800 --> 0:41:59.800
Thank you Peter.

471
0:41:59.800 --> 0:42:00.800
Okay.

472
0:42:00.800 --> 0:42:19.620
I will now like boundary this.

473
0:42:19.620 --> 0:42:22.580
Okay.

474
0:42:22.580 --> 0:42:29.020
Thank you Peter.
