WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.680
Great, yeah, sorry for the old, the usual, I'm sure you're used to it now.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.000
Great to see so many people here, amazing.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.640
Thanks for your interest in the Co-op Cloud.

00:16.640 --> 00:24.280
Yeah, I'm decentralized, that's my internet name, and these are my enterprise slides

00:24.280 --> 00:25.440
for the Co-op Cloud.

00:25.440 --> 00:32.800
So I've been working on this project now for, yeah, maybe two to three years, I would say,

00:32.800 --> 00:40.160
so there's a lot of knowledge of the project, how it happened, and what came to pass, locked

00:40.160 --> 00:46.560
up in my head, but I am only one person involved in this project, which has now become quite

00:46.560 --> 00:50.080
a wonderful project, I would say, which involves a lot of different collectors, a lot of different

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
groups.

00:51.080 --> 00:55.140
So yeah, this is just kind of like a moment to offload what we've been up to for the last

00:55.140 --> 01:02.760
two years, and yeah, all the hot takes are mine, mine alone.

01:02.760 --> 01:08.360
Some of the images are taken from, yeah, shout out to fellow worker Trav, the internet gardening

01:08.360 --> 01:15.080
collection on Arena, I totally recommend checking that out, it's great.

01:15.080 --> 01:22.200
So yeah, Co-op Cloud, this is the official website ready description of what the Co-op

01:22.200 --> 01:26.720
Cloud is, a software stack that aims to make hosting Libra software applications simple

01:26.720 --> 01:31.240
for small service providers, such as tech co-ops who are looking to standardize around

01:31.240 --> 01:37.440
open transparent and scalable infrastructure, which is a lot.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.160
So I was thinking, how am I going to explain this?

01:40.160 --> 01:43.800
Because we come straight in with a software stack, but actually it's much more than that.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.560
I think you could argue our project is more a social endeavor, social organizing, more

01:49.560 --> 01:53.140
than a technical thing, but of course they're overlapping.

01:53.140 --> 02:00.160
So I thought, well, okay, we'll just go back, we'll do a history lesson on how the project

02:00.160 --> 02:01.160
started.

02:01.160 --> 02:08.360
And I feel like that is an important angle for introducing the project, so I want you

02:08.360 --> 02:12.880
to understand where the project is coming from, and then maybe you feel welcome to join

02:12.880 --> 02:17.200
the project and shape the future of the project.

02:17.200 --> 02:23.120
And I think this historical view on where things are coming helps to ground the project

02:23.120 --> 02:26.680
in an actual need, human need.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.400
There's a lot of software projects out there that are just like, why does this exist?

02:31.400 --> 02:38.240
But we're trying to show that this is socially useful, and why we have come up with this

02:38.240 --> 02:45.960
project and initiated and tried to make it work is based on what we needed at the time.

02:45.960 --> 02:50.440
But that may necessarily be the case in the future.

02:50.440 --> 02:56.800
So yeah, put that to one side, and let me introduce you to the magic brain of autonomic

02:56.800 --> 02:58.520
co-op.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.360
So these are some people in the co-op.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.140
There's me on the banjo.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.140
That's not all of them.

03:04.140 --> 03:07.200
There's 13 of us, as far as I remember.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.680
We have a new website that was just put up last night, so check it out.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
It's hilarious.

03:11.680 --> 03:16.560
I don't know if I can get up here, but I'll try maybe at some point.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.280
So yeah, we're a technology cooperative, a worker-owned cooperative.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.840
That means the people who work in the business own the business.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.400
It's run and managed by ourselves.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.940
And that means we're, yeah, this is like a, you know, when we come into where we work,

03:32.940 --> 03:37.560
we have the chance to make decisions about every aspect of how the workplace runs.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.040
So you know, what kind of work do we want to do?

03:40.040 --> 03:43.040
How do we want to make decisions?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.120
How do we deal with money?

03:44.120 --> 03:46.240
How do we find the new work?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.660
Who do we want to work with?

03:48.660 --> 03:52.200
Another member wants to work with this group, but someone else disagrees with that.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.200
How do we work this out?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.440
How do we deal with conflict?

03:55.440 --> 04:03.080
It's kind of an end-to-end workplace situation where you have the chance to, you know, be

04:03.080 --> 04:05.040
involved in every step of the process.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.400
And of course, you don't have to do that alone.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.040
You can do that with your friends.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.000
So that's the kind of model of the cooperative.

04:14.000 --> 04:25.840
Yeah, and one of the kind of, yeah, I'll come back to the website maybe in a bit.

04:25.840 --> 04:34.760
So one of the ideas behind what a cooperative is, is this listing of cooperative principles.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.160
You can see them on the right-hand side there.

04:38.160 --> 04:43.560
For example, autonomy, independence, you know, economic participation of the members, open

04:43.560 --> 04:44.880
voluntary membership.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.700
These are kind of like non-binding principles of what it means to be a co-op.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.200
Principle six, for example, that you will work with other co-ops.

04:52.200 --> 04:57.440
So you know, we want to expand cooperation in the ecosystem of groups that are trying

04:57.440 --> 05:00.640
to do this as well.

05:00.640 --> 05:09.600
And a lot of these hinge on actually having money to survive in order to practice what

05:09.600 --> 05:11.880
it means to be a cooperative.

05:11.880 --> 05:16.480
So we are a technology cooperative, and what do we do exactly?

05:16.480 --> 05:20.480
And you could kind of say we do basically everything and anything.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.280
Like we would happily develop a new piece of software, but we'd also come to your house

05:24.280 --> 05:27.080
and fix your toaster.

05:27.080 --> 05:32.120
We try to work with people that we want to work with, that we want to support, that we

05:32.120 --> 05:36.840
like their work, or that connect with our values.

05:36.840 --> 05:41.720
And one of the things we've done quite successfully, in my opinion, is to run a free software stack

05:41.720 --> 05:45.520
boat internally and for the people we work with.

05:45.520 --> 05:51.000
So we have like all the things we use, our free software.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.120
So we're pretty good at that, managing our own internal infrastructure.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.200
And so necessarily we would then just offer that to groups.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.220
Like do you want a website?

06:02.220 --> 06:04.600
Do you want your own chat system, like a matrix?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.200
Or do you want a wiki?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.600
Or do you want an xCloud or whatever?

06:07.600 --> 06:11.960
This kind of stuff, this classic hosting situation.

06:11.960 --> 06:17.080
And one of these problems that has come up, Autonautics is running like several years

06:17.080 --> 06:24.120
now, five years or so, is that it's difficult to make money when you just do hosting.

06:24.120 --> 06:28.360
People are used to just getting stuff for free, for very understandable reasons.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.600
Big tech.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.920
And at some point, we want to scale out of the code.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.200
We want to involve more people.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
We want to be able to make a living from it.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.840
We want to be able to survive, pay the rent, and so on.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.040
And then we started realizing that, OK, actually we're making more money, or people are happy

06:45.040 --> 06:47.640
to pay us more when we are doing support.

06:47.640 --> 06:54.320
And this is talking to people, getting on a call and being like, what is software?

06:54.320 --> 06:55.600
And then talking about it.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.000
Or what is a wiki?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Everyone's saying wiki.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.360
I don't know what a wiki is.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.960
And just having a chat about it.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.200
But then also being around later.

07:05.200 --> 07:11.280
So once they ask for the thing, like an xCloud, you set it up and then you don't disappear

07:11.280 --> 07:15.400
because you're a cooperative and you intend to continue.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.520
So sustainability is one of the core principles.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.760
So we stick with them.

07:19.760 --> 07:20.760
We chat.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.680
We're contact on mail and so on.

07:23.680 --> 07:30.160
So this is kind of the dilemma of like, we want to definitely do more hosting because

07:30.160 --> 07:32.720
people need digital infrastructure to do their work.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.560
This is just like a base layer of how to organize things.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.600
But it's difficult to survive.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.960
As a technology cooperative, only doing hosting.

07:41.960 --> 07:47.280
So you need to expand what you do.

07:47.280 --> 07:54.120
And one of the places we ended up was using Cloudron, which is a kind of like one-click

07:54.120 --> 07:58.800
install open source system, which I would still recommend.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
It's great.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
It got us really far.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.840
A lot of the next slides criticize it.

08:02.840 --> 08:07.880
So I'm just going to say it's great on this slide.

08:07.880 --> 08:13.520
So you can see you have your classic selection of open source apps if you're familiar with

08:13.520 --> 08:14.520
that stuff.

08:14.520 --> 08:19.960
Like RockaChat, for example, we use RockaChat to communicate in the co-op.

08:19.960 --> 08:28.600
And what this enabled us to do was basically work with different groups that may not necessarily

08:28.600 --> 08:36.800
have money to support us, like to make it sustainable to work with them, but still support

08:36.800 --> 08:38.240
them to do their work.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.720
And Cloudron was like a really kind of like get out of jail card in that sense.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.200
It was like, okay, I can just like hit five times on this WordPress button.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.680
And we've got five WordPress sites.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
And people are going.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.680
They're posting.

08:49.680 --> 08:50.680
They're organizing.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
They're working.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
We're supporting them.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
It's brilliant.

08:53.680 --> 09:00.280
And for those that don't know, Cloudron is just like you fire up a server, you SSH into

09:00.280 --> 09:05.360
it, you run a command, it spins up this thing, and you're going.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.640
You can install multiple apps on the same server.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.280
So this really reduces the costs for rolling out digital infrastructure.

09:13.280 --> 09:18.640
Let me check time, sorry.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.640
Yes.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.640
All right.

09:20.640 --> 09:25.800
So yeah, remember I said that Cloudron is cool.

09:25.800 --> 09:34.680
But at some point, the core of the part, the front end, the web front end became proprietary.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
So they made a switch.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.480
In some sense, I can't blame them because, as I said, if you want to survive, you need

09:39.480 --> 09:42.800
to make a book, and you need to pay the rent and so on.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.880
But yeah, that made us nervous.

09:45.880 --> 09:50.840
When we work with people as a cooperative, we want to say we'll be around for you.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
We want to continue.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.560
We want to do this sustainably.

09:54.560 --> 09:59.320
And if you remember, one of the principles is like our independence.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.200
Can we exist in this world?

10:01.200 --> 10:05.920
There's, of course, interdependencies, but can we continue to do what we want to do

10:05.920 --> 10:09.960
without relying on one specific thing?

10:09.960 --> 10:15.280
So when Cloudron made the decision to make the front end proprietary, you can still use

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
it, whatever.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.280
It's a great system.

10:17.280 --> 10:23.960
But we thought, oh no, what's going to happen?

10:23.960 --> 10:27.440
And then we started looking a bit deeper.

10:27.440 --> 10:35.920
And we realized that Cloudron, when you click and install an app, the apps are...

10:35.920 --> 10:38.320
Yeah, it's an image.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.680
So it uses a container system.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.400
It's kind of like a light virtualization layer.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.440
They're packaging all the apps themselves.

10:47.440 --> 10:52.400
So the people who work in Cloudron, Inc., or whatever, when they want to provide a new

10:52.400 --> 10:59.360
app, they say, okay, let's make a new Git repository and let's package this thing.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.540
And that's great, and it works really well.

11:01.540 --> 11:04.640
But then we realized that they had packaged...

11:04.640 --> 11:09.200
I can't remember specific apps, but take, for example, Nextcloud.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.360
They had gone, and some worker in Cloudron had packaged Nextcloud.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.920
But then we went to the upstream Nextcloud repository, and we saw they had provided an

11:15.920 --> 11:16.960
image.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.680
And then we thought, well, why aren't we just working with them?

11:20.680 --> 11:24.920
Because that would connect our values with expanding cooperation in different layers

11:24.920 --> 11:28.640
of the software stack and so on.

11:28.640 --> 11:33.160
And then the more we looked, we realized that free software communities were really converging

11:33.160 --> 11:37.920
on the idea that you have a packaged image inside your repository.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.960
So you're hacking on your source code, and you just have an image that's building.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.320
And we can use that.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.740
That's what Cloudron needs.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.560
So we were like, okay, that's interesting.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.960
Maybe let's think about that.

11:49.960 --> 12:01.320
And then the logical end of the paranoia or whatever was that we were relying on this one

12:01.320 --> 12:07.800
company, this one group.

12:07.800 --> 12:15.400
Autonomic is a cooperative that supports maybe 20-plus groups, but a large selection of them

12:15.400 --> 12:19.120
have very little money to pay for the infrastructure.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.800
So if you could imagine that Cloudron would somehow make a bigger step into more proprietary

12:23.800 --> 12:29.100
solutions or somehow increase the cost or who knows what, we'd be in a position where

12:29.100 --> 12:31.640
we can support those groups.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.680
And that's not something we wanted to deal with.

12:34.680 --> 12:41.760
So we started to try to think, like, you know, where do we make this better or whatever?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.960
And that is the start of Cloud.

12:44.960 --> 12:51.240
So now we're getting back into another take on that original really long sentence that

12:51.240 --> 12:54.360
had things like software stack in it.

12:54.360 --> 13:02.160
Yeah, we were like, let's just eliminate this issue of proprietary angles or whatever.

13:02.160 --> 13:06.480
Oh, yeah, here's where I just couldn't get the emoji in the slide, so I just gave up.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.540
Yeah, we were just like, we'll just copy left the entire thing.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.540
Let's just do that.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.040
That seems sensible.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.040
Cool.

13:14.040 --> 13:22.600
And then, as I mentioned, Yee Ha, Terrell, favorite emoji, we want to work with the upstream

13:22.600 --> 13:29.960
developers of the software because a lot of precarity is in the open source ecosystem

13:29.960 --> 13:35.000
in that there's, you know, certain developers which are doing unpaid labor to develop the

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
software that a lot of us rely on.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.880
And they're providing these, you know, a lot of them are providing these packages.

13:41.880 --> 13:47.680
And we thought, well, OK, we can just meet them where they're at, engage with them on

13:47.680 --> 13:55.360
the issue tracker, you know, speak to them, make them aware of our hosting efforts.

13:55.360 --> 14:02.000
And you know, we're in a sense like closer to end users in that, you know, it's like

14:02.000 --> 14:08.280
developers, hosters, users, you know, summarized.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.960
And often developers, well, they've got their hands full trying to make the software work.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.480
So we can like help that connection.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.540
So we're trying to bridge that in that sense.

14:18.540 --> 14:25.320
And also, which we'll see later on, they're also providing, so they're packaging up their

14:25.320 --> 14:32.560
apps in images, but they're also providing this kind of extra configuration around it,

14:32.560 --> 14:36.600
which kind of tells you how to deploy the thing, which is great for people who are doing

14:36.600 --> 14:41.280
hosting because, OK, we have an app, but does it need a database, for example?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.600
So what database?

14:43.600 --> 14:45.440
But they're also doing that for us as well.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.880
So if you develop over our software, thank you.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.200
Yeah.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.000
And then the democratic governance.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.520
We were going to initiate this project, let's say.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.720
I wouldn't say we like invented it.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.520
We just like collude a bunch of stuff together.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.240
But we wanted to not be in control of that.

15:06.240 --> 15:13.200
So not become the new Cloud Run, which is like, OK, let's set up some clear rules for

15:13.200 --> 15:15.160
how do you interact with this project?

15:15.160 --> 15:18.120
And also, on what basis?

15:18.120 --> 15:20.100
Are you also a technology cooperative?

15:20.100 --> 15:21.340
Are you a personal developer?

15:21.340 --> 15:22.880
Are you a user of the software?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.320
Do you want to support the host?

15:24.320 --> 15:26.080
Or do you want to support the device?

15:26.080 --> 15:32.640
We can start to engage with it where we're at, but meet in this kind of common project.

15:32.640 --> 15:41.720
And obviously, the goal then is to sustain open source digital infrastructure and expand

15:41.720 --> 15:43.720
cooperation.

15:43.720 --> 15:44.480
Yeah.

15:44.480 --> 15:52.360
So moving out of the history phase and now into what it actually is.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.760
Yes.

15:53.760 --> 16:03.680
So this word kind of pops up if you've checked the website or the docs.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.040
Democratic tech collectives.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.040
So what is that actually?

16:09.040 --> 16:15.360
We are so Autonomic is a more public registered in the UK.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.800
We're publicly regulated.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.520
We're a cooperative society.

16:19.520 --> 16:26.960
We have gone through the paperwork to make that happen because we wanted to do that.

16:26.960 --> 16:33.460
But we recognize that not everyone will want to do that or be able to do that.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.920
And this really depends on a per country basis.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.000
If you're in the Netherlands, it's a different model.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.560
If you're in the UK, the way you relate to the legal system and the state is like, in

16:45.560 --> 16:46.720
Germany, it's quite difficult.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.600
I've been told there's no way to kind of just like slot yourself in.

16:49.600 --> 16:57.600
You're like, yeah, it's not like very easy to find information.

16:57.600 --> 17:02.040
And we don't want that to be a limiting factor in working together.

17:02.040 --> 17:07.000
So we were trying to conceptualize this idea of like what other groups would we be willing

17:07.000 --> 17:13.880
to work with but not close that definition down from the outside.

17:13.880 --> 17:22.200
So we were thinking about other groups who want to work with their friends or together

17:22.200 --> 17:26.280
with other groups and have set up decision making, for example, collective decision making.

17:26.280 --> 17:31.520
So they're able to navigate what they want to do together.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.560
That was kind of like a thing we wanted to do.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.480
We want to be able to interact with each other.

17:35.480 --> 17:41.320
We want to be able to disagree and receive and send constructive feedback, reach, compromise,

17:41.320 --> 17:43.240
stuff like this.

17:43.240 --> 17:48.080
This is kind of easier to do when people are already organized in their own groups.

17:48.080 --> 17:54.600
But yeah, this didn't really rule out individuals who are active in the project at the moment

17:54.600 --> 17:57.600
and also other technology cooperatives.

17:57.600 --> 18:03.480
We're kind of just trying to like saddle through it somehow and be like, just work with us.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.480
Let's figure it out together.

18:04.480 --> 18:11.560
And this has been in progress for some time, the formalization of what this means.

18:11.560 --> 18:18.040
And that's an open process which I would love to invite you to come check out.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.000
The configuration commons.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.160
This is a, so as I said before, we have open source apps that we can package them in images

18:27.160 --> 18:33.420
and then we can specify a configuration around those images to describe how that app should

18:33.420 --> 18:40.120
look like in a deployment on a server live and well, people using it.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.960
And one of the things we noticed was that, as I said before, the configuration that was

18:44.960 --> 18:51.640
being provided by the upstream repositories was useful, but it didn't specify the full

18:51.640 --> 18:56.920
kind of end-to-end production kind of scenario.

18:56.920 --> 19:02.520
And that's kind of a big word, but for example, how to back up the app data.

19:02.520 --> 19:06.040
Like the thing is deployed, people are using it and we need to make sure their data is

19:06.040 --> 19:07.480
safe, so we need to back it up.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
How do we back the thing up?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.480
How do we restore it?

19:09.480 --> 19:15.360
This is kind of like a step from it works to it works and it's safe for these people

19:15.360 --> 19:16.560
to use it.

19:16.560 --> 19:23.640
And we wanted to encapsulate that into our configuration.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.640
So this is a big part of it.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.360
We'll go through each one of these deeper.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.320
I'm just going to overview them now.

19:29.320 --> 19:34.280
Yeah, Abra is a command line tool, so our own digital tools, we wanted to be involved

19:34.280 --> 19:39.960
in how the tools are shaped and how we use them.

19:39.960 --> 19:44.320
That's a great situation where you're dog-fooding your own system with your peers and you're

19:44.320 --> 19:48.480
trying to figure out how does this best suit us.

19:48.480 --> 19:55.280
And according to our own constraints, we can't spend all day learning this obscure system

19:55.280 --> 19:59.920
or we can't invest too much time in some things.

19:59.920 --> 20:06.960
So we need to cut corners and it's best to be involved directly in that process.

20:06.960 --> 20:11.240
And if we remember back to Cloudron again, sorry, I'm not going to be bashing them at

20:11.240 --> 20:15.320
all, but yeah, like how do we interact with the system?

20:15.320 --> 20:20.280
In the case of Cloudron, it was a web front end.

20:20.280 --> 20:27.680
But if we're talking about interacting with technology cooperatives and other tech collectives,

20:27.680 --> 20:31.480
there's kind of a difference to begin with because Cloudron is maybe trying to provide

20:31.480 --> 20:35.840
for the, say, let's say, non-technical user or someone who can just kind of get in, click

20:35.840 --> 20:37.760
a few buttons or whatever.

20:37.760 --> 20:44.560
But we're already dealing with groups that are actively deeply involved with Linux system

20:44.560 --> 20:45.800
administration and so on.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.480
So do we need a front end?

20:48.480 --> 20:56.720
So those are the kind of questions we can ask and answer them ourselves in those moments.

20:56.720 --> 21:04.240
And the collective infrastructure, so there's a lot that goes on in between getting an app

21:04.240 --> 21:07.600
out and someone using it.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.320
People have to meet each other and talk and who are you and what's going on and what do

21:11.320 --> 21:13.480
you do and all this kind of stuff.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.160
And then money, where does the money go?

21:17.160 --> 21:18.800
What do you charge?

21:18.800 --> 21:22.520
It's just this end to end, all the social processes that go in and around that.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.600
We wanted to build those up too because that is a huge problem when you're starting off

21:26.600 --> 21:30.040
as a collective and you're like, oh no, where's my bank account?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
Like how do I get a bank account?

21:31.040 --> 21:36.840
And you can see Open Collective, for example, doing this, just like mutualizing this financial

21:36.840 --> 21:40.440
infrastructure and just getting people going.

21:40.440 --> 21:50.000
So yeah, docs, Git hosting, getting off GitHub, that's cool, stuff like that.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
So I'm going to go through these a bit deeper.

21:56.000 --> 22:04.800
We're trying to form, so our proposal at the moment as autonomic, which is, yeah, now I

22:04.800 --> 22:08.400
can say the sentence and I hope it's a bit clearer.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.400
We initiated this project and we're deeply embedded inside it, but we're attempting to

22:12.400 --> 22:18.880
step out of the project and reenter on an equal basis with other collectives.

22:18.880 --> 22:24.160
So in order to do that, we're proposing a federation model, which is based on a great

22:24.160 --> 22:28.800
project called Co-op Cycle, if you've heard about.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.840
But basically different groups can interact with each other.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.600
There will be democratic decision making and some laws and we'll come up with a constitution

22:36.600 --> 22:39.480
together and all this kind of stuff.

22:39.480 --> 22:42.280
I couldn't fit in on this line, but it's not just chaotic nerds.

22:42.280 --> 22:51.680
It's also open to, we can imagine the people who are using the software grouping together

22:51.680 --> 22:57.240
and joining our federation as well to say, hey, this button should be over there.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.800
Could you just fix that?

22:58.800 --> 23:03.800
But in a more collective sense, we could be gathering money, we could be figuring out

23:03.800 --> 23:05.960
how to improve things.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.880
You don't have to be able to just write software to join this kind of stuff.

23:09.880 --> 23:20.300
We could be connecting the different struggles to build up a better open source ecosystem.

23:20.300 --> 23:24.720
So this is a process that's going on right now.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.240
There's invites going out.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.420
We have a new round of private funding.

23:28.420 --> 23:29.920
Thank you, Private Funders.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.680
And yeah, there'll be more news.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.360
But check the website if you're interested in this.

23:34.360 --> 23:40.680
If you're also part of a collective, love to hear from you.

23:40.680 --> 23:46.240
This is a massive problem that we, of course, experience as being six-admins.

23:46.240 --> 23:53.040
And we've seen a lot of people join in on the old Matrix channels and that would be

23:53.040 --> 23:59.160
one person setting up a few apps for friends, family, maybe their local community, a food

23:59.160 --> 24:01.080
co-op, what have you.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.920
And then a few months down the line, it's completely overwhelming.

24:04.920 --> 24:09.200
The email broke, or it doesn't do this, or who knows what.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.400
If you do any sys admin, you'll know the story.

24:13.400 --> 24:19.520
But when you step into the Cloud project, you have this chance to meet your peers who

24:19.520 --> 24:20.680
are also doing this work.

24:20.680 --> 24:25.280
They may not be involved in your project whatsoever, but that's not important.

24:25.280 --> 24:34.760
We have this idea of the config comments that means we can share work on the next Cloud

24:34.760 --> 24:35.760
recipe.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.760
That's what we call them.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.720
We'll come to that in a bit.

24:39.720 --> 24:44.040
So we can work together on the same configuration.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.280
And that means we're sharing tips, tricks, we're talking together.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.240
It's like, this group of users wants this.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.240
Do you want that?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.960
Oh, I tried this.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
This kind of stuff.

24:53.960 --> 25:02.400
This has been seen to be a great feature of trying to just open the door for people to

25:02.400 --> 25:05.120
come in and work together.

25:05.120 --> 25:16.760
Because there's a lot of tools that propose reuse and mind share and collective point

25:16.760 --> 25:26.000
of reference, but don't really live up to that, the ideal of reuse.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.120
Just not doing it again, repeating yourself.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.200
So we were conscious of that.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.120
We're trying to work on that.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.380
Focus on training and collaboration.

25:35.380 --> 25:38.880
So we wanted it to be easy to onboard.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.080
We want more democratic tech collectors to pop up.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.840
We want more technology cooperatives to be able to start.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.680
We want people to be able to decide, I want to own and run my own workplace, and I want

25:49.680 --> 25:56.400
to bootstrap some infrastructure for groups I find cool in my city.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.920
And that's what Cloud is about.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.120
It's like a tool set for these people.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.360
It has to be easy to use, of course.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.900
And we're very focused on that public.

26:05.900 --> 26:11.520
So groups who have already decided that that's what they want to do.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.760
They're on the terminal.

26:13.760 --> 26:16.560
At the moment, we only have the terminal clients.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.400
And they're getting into that.

26:18.400 --> 26:23.520
We can't do everything for everyone, but we can definitely, with that public in mind,

26:23.520 --> 26:30.760
we can be focused on how we attempt to make it accessible and usable.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.720
And yes, cooperating with other networks.

26:32.720 --> 26:38.880
So we want to, within our network, of course, we want to have groups join.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.420
But for the groups that don't want to join, we still want to work with them.

26:41.420 --> 26:44.960
If they have the same values, if they're doing similar things, we can also interface with

26:44.960 --> 26:45.960
them.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.720
And we've already seen that happening.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.800
And I'll come back to that in a bit.

26:51.800 --> 26:59.200
But once things are clear and they're getting clear, like we are a group of cooperatives,

26:59.200 --> 27:02.640
we have this configuration commons, we have these tools, we're just specifying what we

27:02.640 --> 27:07.360
are, then it's easier for other groups to say, OK, I understand what is happening here,

27:07.360 --> 27:09.640
and I would like to do this with you.

27:09.640 --> 27:16.960
So there's kind of like a concrete example, find funding together.

27:16.960 --> 27:25.600
So yeah, the conflict commons, yes, the open source apps you love.

27:25.600 --> 27:31.440
It's this catalog of software that is out there, and people are developing the next

27:31.440 --> 27:37.260
cloud, the media wikis, the synapses, the GITI, the whole thing.

27:37.260 --> 27:46.200
So we have quite an expanding conflict commons so that you can deploy a lot of apps.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.200
So that's a thing.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.000
People come to us and they're like, oh, I need a calendar, or I need a note taking app

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
or an app, or whatever.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.320
And then we're out hunting in the open source ecosystem for apps to add to the catalog.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.120
So that's that.

28:03.120 --> 28:10.040
So to come back to this idea of the image is the app, which is the packaged thing, and

28:10.040 --> 28:15.080
then the kind of wrapper around that, which specifies the end-to-end, kind of how they

28:15.080 --> 28:17.640
should look in production.

28:17.640 --> 28:25.280
And we were conscious to not reinvent a packaging format, and we didn't really know what to

28:25.280 --> 28:33.000
do at that point because we thought, OK, we need to be able to say how, in one file, let's

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
say, in plain text, a config file, like, here's the app, and how do you back it up?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
How do you restore it?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
How do you take it down?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
How do you bring it up?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
How do you configure it?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
How do you plug it?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.440
This kind of stuff.

28:45.440 --> 28:54.040
And as it turns out, the Docker Compose ecosystem and Docker has kind of been moving towards

28:54.040 --> 28:56.240
the Compose standard they're calling it.

28:56.240 --> 29:01.520
And it's basically, if you've ever seen the Docker Compose file, it's a YAML text file,

29:01.520 --> 29:05.520
and it kind of just specifies what we're looking for.

29:05.520 --> 29:12.320
So we just figured, great, upstream developers are already using this.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.680
This is a developing open standard.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.000
Great.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.680
Let's just build on this.

29:18.680 --> 29:24.040
And I think, as it turns out, that was a good choice and has had many benefits, which we'll

29:24.040 --> 29:25.880
come to on the next slide.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
Yeah.

29:26.880 --> 29:32.400
So we're working with upstream developers, and yeah, we're...

29:32.400 --> 29:37.120
So in my background, I've done a lot of configuration management tool, like, for example, working

29:37.120 --> 29:41.680
with Ansible, which was always the grand ideal of reusing roles.

29:41.680 --> 29:51.040
If anyone has used Ansible before, it's kind of like a packaging format for, you know,

29:51.040 --> 29:56.680
you have a server and you want to install, like, Apache on it or something.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.680
And you tell Ansible, install Apache for me.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.240
And then you want to install a new thing.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.920
And then you kind of package this into a role.

30:03.920 --> 30:08.720
And at some point, I realized that everybody is writing the same roles.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.560
It's very difficult to, like, share and to reuse other people's stuff.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.160
It's definitely happening, but not on the scale that I was looking for.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.840
And so I was looking for alternatives.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.880
Yeah.

30:20.880 --> 30:28.000
So in the project so far, we've seen people, like, we have, for example, Matrix Service

30:28.000 --> 30:29.800
Synapse installs.

30:29.800 --> 30:35.840
We've seen multiple collectives look at the config and say, this works for me.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.240
I'm going to use this.

30:37.240 --> 30:41.120
And then changing the config in collaboration with other groups.

30:41.120 --> 30:46.520
So we're already seeing that people are able to make the changes that works for them without

30:46.520 --> 30:48.260
breaking other people's installs.

30:48.260 --> 30:51.600
And then when things need to be worked out, they speak to each other.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.640
And things move along.

30:54.640 --> 31:01.760
And again, the Compose standard really helps here in that it's quite flexible and helps

31:01.760 --> 31:03.560
us.

31:03.560 --> 31:07.240
People can move around each other inside the configuration, which will hopefully become

31:07.240 --> 31:09.240
clear on the next slide.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
Yes, great.

31:10.240 --> 31:20.000
We are calling the app configuration a recipe, cooking inspired, and it's a key repository.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.680
Here you have Git.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
Git.

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
Git.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.680
Git.

31:24.680 --> 31:25.680
Git.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.680
Git.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.680
Git.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.680
Git.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.680
Git.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.680
Git.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
Git.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.680
Git.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.680
Git.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.680
Git.

31:34.680 --> 31:35.680
Git.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.680
Git.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.680
Git.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.680
Git.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.680
Git.

31:39.680 --> 31:46.680
The main cause of this format is that if you've ever used, I think it's a Docker, I think it

31:46.680 --> 31:49.040
was a Docker Compose command line client.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.160
You can kind of chain the Compose files.

31:51.160 --> 31:59.640
So you can say like Docker Compose up, Compose.yaml minus F, Compose.some-other-thing.yaml.

31:59.640 --> 32:05.120
And the system will internally merge all of these configurations together and then roll

32:05.120 --> 32:13.120
out the app, which I never had occasion to use until I realized that maybe somebody wants

32:13.120 --> 32:18.320
to use Postgres and maybe someone wants to use MariaDB.

32:18.320 --> 32:27.680
These simple choices for deployments, if it's not possible to kind of like make this easy

32:27.680 --> 32:31.820
to do between different groups, it would never work out.

32:31.820 --> 32:38.080
So very, very thankful to the people who wrote this standard.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.880
So you can see here, you can kind of, and it'll become clear when we talk about the

32:41.880 --> 32:48.200
command line client, you can kind of specify, okay, I want MariaDB and I want the SMTP config

32:48.200 --> 32:50.440
bundle all together, roll it out.

32:50.440 --> 32:54.080
And I don't want Postgres or I don't want this or I don't want that.

32:54.080 --> 32:58.520
And this allows people to just expand the config to suit their needs, document it, let

32:58.520 --> 32:59.920
people know this is a new feature.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.040
So it's quite nice.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.720
You can be just hosting some software and then somebody says, oh, great, OpenID Connect

33:04.720 --> 33:06.960
now works with this, just load this thing in.

33:06.960 --> 33:11.520
And, you know, this is really helping us move forward and get things done.

33:11.520 --> 33:19.480
Yeah, at the moment, we have a command line client called Abra.

33:19.480 --> 33:24.040
And this is the kind of day-to-day interface for how you manage your call cloud installs.

33:24.040 --> 33:28.320
So you have a server, you deploy stuff to the server, you're using Abra on the command

33:28.320 --> 33:29.780
line.

33:29.780 --> 33:35.960
That was a real, that was a large decision for us at the time because we didn't have

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
much money.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.680
We didn't know if we would be able to pull off a web front end.

33:40.680 --> 33:45.000
And again, as I mentioned before, we were trying to target specifically, like, who is

33:45.000 --> 33:46.500
the public of this project?

33:46.500 --> 33:49.440
Are they people who know and are comfortable on the command line?

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
Yes.

33:50.440 --> 33:54.640
Okay, let's just go ahead with this and try to make it work.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.140
So we wrote in Bash, the first one, and I still completely recommend it.

33:59.140 --> 34:02.040
Just unleash your inner Unix.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.080
It was great.

34:03.080 --> 34:11.800
It managed to get us to, you know, zero to hero in relatively short amount of time and

34:11.800 --> 34:14.640
have a system that was working.

34:14.640 --> 34:20.320
One of the kind of core ideas behind developing our own tools, we were very conscious that

34:20.320 --> 34:21.320
we might fail.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.320
We wouldn't be able to get it done.

34:24.320 --> 34:28.960
And we wanted to have that, the conflict commons would kind of live separately.

34:28.960 --> 34:34.840
So these would be kind of not interdependent in a way that if one broke, the other would

34:34.840 --> 34:36.080
break.

34:36.080 --> 34:43.020
So if you even today, if you just ignore that, you can still drop into the command line,

34:43.020 --> 34:47.300
run a bunch of commands and roll out the app, which is great.

34:47.300 --> 34:50.760
And that's kind of how we originally conceded with the Bash system.

34:50.760 --> 34:55.480
We were just running a bunch of commands and we had kind of laid it all out in a way that

34:55.480 --> 34:58.760
kind of said, okay, you can just push that out.

34:58.760 --> 35:04.160
So yeah, thanks to Kalex, a fellow worker who's great at Bash programming.

35:04.160 --> 35:07.240
We wouldn't have done it without them.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.280
Yes.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.440
So then we rewrote and go.

35:09.440 --> 35:15.000
We actually managed to get some funding, which we'll come to after.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.560
I guess they're not Bash programmers, if they read the source.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.080
They might have felt otherwise.

35:20.080 --> 35:26.720
But at that point, we were running into issues with the Bash implementation, which we felt

35:26.720 --> 35:33.840
quite proud about, that we had gone ahead and found the limits of the simplest possible

35:33.840 --> 35:37.200
thing that we could do.

35:37.200 --> 35:42.640
And the issues were it was difficult to install on multiple systems.

35:42.640 --> 35:47.800
It relied on a number of built-in commands that were not always available on, you know,

35:47.800 --> 35:51.120
like a Fedora, Debian or whatever.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.860
So yeah, portability.

35:53.860 --> 35:59.720
We were struggling with, we wanted to kind of develop other aspects of, like we wanted

35:59.720 --> 36:05.200
the tools to be able to speak to the config commons, but not directly parse each other.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.800
And that ended up being a kind of like JSON catalog.

36:07.800 --> 36:14.280
But then parsing data formats in Bash is difficult, so we were kind of pulling our hair out on

36:14.280 --> 36:16.320
that one.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.860
And then concurrency.

36:18.860 --> 36:22.360
We were struggling to manage horizontal scaling.

36:22.360 --> 36:27.080
So if you work with 18 groups, they want to have their own VPSs.

36:27.080 --> 36:32.320
If you have 10 servers, you know, the tool has to, like, fire a request at each 10 of

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
them or whatever.

36:33.320 --> 36:38.560
And then if it's going through each one at a time, you have to wait.

36:38.560 --> 36:45.000
And as a result of kind of scaling up and using this absolutely pre-alpha software and

36:45.000 --> 36:50.560
autonomic for production purposes, we reached the limits of the software.

36:50.560 --> 36:52.760
So we ended up rewriting it in Go.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.920
Somebody knew Go in autonomic at the time.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.400
That's the reason.

36:56.400 --> 37:04.160
But also we saw that it was really, you know, we could get this concurrency issue sorted

37:04.160 --> 37:05.200
and the portability.

37:05.200 --> 37:10.720
So Go kind of gives you a language-level feature that's quite easy to say, like, fire a request

37:10.720 --> 37:12.600
at these 10 things immediately.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.480
And you can build a binary, so you can just fire them out.

37:16.480 --> 37:23.700
So people just get, like, a binary in the system, and this stuff is all baked into it.

37:23.700 --> 37:28.120
So the new problem with this is that it actually works.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.280
It does what it says, and people are starting to use it.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.520
So we're now into this kind of maintenance cycle.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.920
It's kind of approach.

37:34.920 --> 37:41.120
We've done the public beta, so people are using it and starting to rely on it.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.880
And we've seen people hacking on it and submitting pull requests and checking it out.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.520
It's all good.

37:47.520 --> 37:53.600
Yeah, so in essence, Abra is a Docker swarm client.

37:53.600 --> 37:57.440
So no, we don't run Kubernetes.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
We run Docker swarm.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
And no, it's not dead.

37:59.440 --> 38:04.920
Docker swarm is a technology that is still alive.

38:04.920 --> 38:11.680
We have, like, a strange, pyrocynical relationship with, like, some installs.

38:11.680 --> 38:15.920
Like some banks have, like, a swarm install of, like, you know, 10,000 nodes or something.

38:15.920 --> 38:20.840
And the current owner, I believe it's Marantis or something that's been in exchange of who

38:20.840 --> 38:23.240
owns it or who, yeah, I can't remember.

38:23.240 --> 38:30.560
But it's still being maintained, and we're happy to see that it is being maintained.

38:30.560 --> 38:38.400
Because we identify that swarm mode in Docker is kind of the appropriate feature set that

38:38.400 --> 38:48.040
we need without having to deal with going into learning how to, you know, roll out a

38:48.040 --> 38:51.240
large system which is built for, like, large scale.

38:51.240 --> 38:56.440
Our, you know, and again, this is, like, what was Autonomic doing at the time was, like,

38:56.440 --> 39:01.520
rolling out single servers, deploying a few apps, no greater than, like, 10 to 30, 50,

39:01.520 --> 39:05.280
100 users or whatever.

39:05.280 --> 39:09.720
And swarm mode provides you with the ability to kind of roll out the app, and if it fails,

39:09.720 --> 39:11.320
it will roll it back for you.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.880
And we can bake that into our config.

39:12.880 --> 39:18.440
So we were kind of getting the stability guarantees that we needed.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.920
And not a lot of groups were demanding, you know, when they had, like, a media wiki installed,

39:21.920 --> 39:27.640
they weren't saying there must be 99% uptime in this contract or whatever.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.080
But we still wanted to push that to the limit, like, a high quality, stable service when

39:33.080 --> 39:35.160
we're rolling stuff out.

39:35.160 --> 39:39.680
This should be, yeah.

39:39.680 --> 39:45.800
And then, yeah, this swarm mode just covers that for us, the runtime, the container runtime.

39:45.800 --> 39:51.320
Yeah, this is kind of like the Abra architecture, let's say.

39:51.320 --> 39:57.640
So on the left, you will install Abra, for example, on your local workstation, the command

39:57.640 --> 40:04.080
line tool, and then you'll, via SSH, kind of tell Abra to manage this server.

40:04.080 --> 40:08.960
So it'll read the SSH config and it'll connect to the server and say, okay, I recognize this

40:08.960 --> 40:13.240
server, I see there's a Docker daemon running on this and it's got swarm mode enabled.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.680
Cool.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.640
And then it can, you know, you can do this horizontal scaling where you can have several

40:18.640 --> 40:19.640
servers.

40:19.640 --> 40:28.760
You can load multiple servers into Abra and then you can be sharing the Abra state between

40:28.760 --> 40:29.760
multiple people.

40:29.760 --> 40:37.840
So in a co-op of 13 people, you know, each one who runs Abra, appLS, or whatever, to

40:37.840 --> 40:43.200
list the apps and the servers, we'll see the same state come out.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.280
And we can go into that a bit later.

40:45.280 --> 40:52.920
So yeah, it's built for basically collaboration in the organization that you're in.

40:52.920 --> 40:57.000
And then the other mode is you install Abra directly on the server and it stores the state

40:57.000 --> 41:04.600
on the server, which could be useful if you're, yeah, for specific scenarios, this was requested.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.720
Yeah, some people run this.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.560
I don't myself.

41:08.560 --> 41:12.480
Yeah, and then the final points.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.480
Moving on.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.480
Collective infrastructure.

41:14.480 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, docs, Git hosting, recipes.cloud.tech here.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.400
You can see the list of all the apps we have.

41:23.400 --> 41:28.440
We have an open collective, which is the fiscal host is autonomic.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.480
Bank account in the UK.

41:30.480 --> 41:35.400
And that's been nice because we've been able to, once we got the funding, we were able

41:35.400 --> 41:40.800
to tell people, if you work on this, we can pay you just immediately.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.760
Anything you do, you'll get paid.

41:42.760 --> 41:47.120
And that's great because we know there's a lot of unpaid labor going on in open source

41:47.120 --> 41:48.680
world.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.840
So we didn't want to be a project that said, contribute to our commons and get nothing

41:51.840 --> 41:52.840
back.

41:52.840 --> 41:53.840
No, we could actually pay.

41:53.840 --> 41:57.880
So we set an hourly wage there and we said, this is how much money we have and away you

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
go.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.920
That worked out great, I would say.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.800
And the server firm, Server Co-op.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.400
So I wanted to plug this other project.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.920
You can go to the website, servers.coop.

42:09.920 --> 42:18.560
Yeah, we've been working with a group who have been developing software called Capsule,

42:18.560 --> 42:21.360
Siberia, great hackers.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.720
And they're trying to develop a system.

42:22.720 --> 42:29.360
Well, they have developed a system, which is basically a server provider infrastructure

42:29.360 --> 42:31.800
like Hetzner, for example.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.200
So VPSs.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.520
I need a server to roll one out.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.200
I need another server to roll one out.

42:37.200 --> 42:41.760
And then we, and a couple of other people, myself included, were thinking, okay, this

42:41.760 --> 42:49.240
is great because a lot of collectors are centralizing on server, Hetzner VPSs, right?

42:49.240 --> 42:53.120
And if Hetzner rolls up the price or, you know, we've already seen this with the increase

42:53.120 --> 42:58.520
in cost in IPv4 addresses and the 10% increase this year.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.840
It's getting more costly to run on Hetzner, but it's always been super cheap and that's

43:01.840 --> 43:04.440
been super accessible.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.440
But it could change.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.440
So what do we do?

43:06.440 --> 43:08.800
We need to build up this aspect of our stack.

43:08.800 --> 43:13.040
So we kind of like expand the cooperative layer down to the servers.

43:13.040 --> 43:17.760
And that is the idea behind server's co-op.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.640
And Abra already supports an integration.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.720
So you can do like server new.

43:22.720 --> 43:28.680
And if you've got Capsule running on your server, it'll spin up a VM.

43:28.680 --> 43:35.160
So we were already trying to like, you know, just take a turn into cooperatively managed

43:35.160 --> 43:39.720
infrastructure and build those integrations from the start.

43:39.720 --> 43:42.920
Whether or not they're working that great is for me to be seen.

43:42.920 --> 43:50.160
But yes, so European Cultural Foundation gave us upwards of 30 grand in funding last year

43:50.160 --> 43:54.760
and the year before for in the context of the Culture of Solidarity Fund.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.320
That was amazing.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.880
Thanks to them.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.200
They were really great.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.960
And I would recommend applying to them.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.320
They support us the whole way through.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.320
It was.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.320
Yeah.

44:04.320 --> 44:05.320
It was just fantastic.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.760
We wrote our application and sent it into them.

44:07.760 --> 44:12.440
So pretty happy with that one.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
Great.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.440
Nearly done.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
Yeah.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
I want to just jump.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.440
So this is in paperwork.

44:17.440 --> 44:21.960
Again, I want to plug like, I just find it so important to explain that people are actually

44:21.960 --> 44:25.600
using this and this isn't just like some idea in our heads and we think it's cool.

44:25.600 --> 44:30.520
It's like people are actually running, you know, they rely on some of the things that

44:30.520 --> 44:31.520
have been deployed.

44:31.520 --> 44:38.280
The London Black Space is a project which is about like 13 apps, I think, on a server

44:38.280 --> 44:44.040
somewhere, which was initiated by an artist collective called Ron Grupa, which is like

44:44.040 --> 44:50.000
an Indonesian based collective in the context of Documenta.

44:50.000 --> 44:58.120
And they wanted to kind of approach a group that connected with their values.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.400
At some point they were so they were invited to Documenta to do the work and they thought,

45:01.400 --> 45:04.760
okay, we're all the way over here.

45:04.760 --> 45:08.440
In Indonesia, we need to work with people who are based in Europe, so we're going to

45:08.440 --> 45:12.480
need digital tools, but we don't want to be immediately going on the Google drives of

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
the world.

45:13.480 --> 45:18.440
So how do we build up, you know, extend our ways of working and our values into the digital

45:18.440 --> 45:19.440
realm?

45:19.440 --> 45:23.080
So then they came looking for collectives and co-ops.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.840
Fran put us through to them.

45:24.840 --> 45:33.840
Yeah, and here's just some photos of us just engaging in this massively multiplayer shared

45:33.840 --> 45:35.040
infrastructure project.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.680
So it was really great.

45:36.680 --> 45:43.400
People from my perspective understood what Co-op Cloud was and the mission behind it

45:43.400 --> 45:49.080
and felt invited to kind of look at the technology and what we were doing and comment on that

45:49.080 --> 45:50.200
and give us critique.

45:50.200 --> 45:55.760
You know, we're often in a space where people want to talk about digital tools, but the

45:55.760 --> 45:59.920
first thing they say is, oh, I don't know anything about technology, which is kind of

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
like a hallmark.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.160
You have to like excuse yourself or something.

46:03.160 --> 46:09.040
But we got past that in working with this group of people that may not find themselves

46:09.040 --> 46:10.600
technical.

46:10.600 --> 46:17.200
But as we moved on, again, Co-op Cloud allowed us to just kind of like deploy the tech and

46:17.200 --> 46:22.400
just like just forget about it and then go on with the support work.

46:22.400 --> 46:28.080
And we ended up with like the last great thing I saw from this project was the people involved

46:28.080 --> 46:33.680
in using the tools were publishing videos about how to use the tools in the stacks.

46:33.680 --> 46:37.320
So they were like in the matrix chat and on the peer tube publishing.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.520
Here's how you use peer tube.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.520
Amazing.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.040
Great educational practice.

46:42.040 --> 46:43.040
Totally check it out.

46:43.040 --> 46:46.320
TV.Lum

46:46.320 --> 46:49.320
Among Us Space is the website.

46:49.320 --> 46:52.000
This was another project we met kind of in the context of the documentary.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.880
So this is a comic illustrator's union, which is bootstrapping at the moment.

46:58.880 --> 47:05.280
And they felt, you know, they saw Lum Among Us Space and they were like, this looks cool.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.520
And I like the idea of what is going on.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.440
I understand what is happening here.

47:10.440 --> 47:16.520
There are two groups cooperating here, this kind of like cultural based initiative and

47:16.520 --> 47:18.680
this technology collective.

47:18.680 --> 47:23.200
And you know, I can see the Co-op Cloud website and this looks like we want to check this

47:23.200 --> 47:24.200
out.

47:24.200 --> 47:29.800
So we kind of got over that fear and anxiety and moved through the money exchange and,

47:29.800 --> 47:31.560
you know, let's work together.

47:31.560 --> 47:32.560
It was quite smooth.

47:32.560 --> 47:36.840
So I would say Co-op Cloud is then helping us just again, put these things to rest.

47:36.840 --> 47:42.200
Like this is the project we're based on, you know, when we work, when we deploy your infrastructure,

47:42.200 --> 47:46.360
it will be contributing to the commons, copy left, democratically managed.

47:46.360 --> 47:50.000
You know, you kind of just get over the hump.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.600
And yeah, Kotec is a new co-op, which is starting in Poland.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.480
And that was a major boost.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.920
So they've deployed a bunch of services.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.800
Some members are in the room.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.800
Super nice.

48:03.800 --> 48:11.200
Yeah, it's a software stack which is in its, you know, initiated and developed by Co-operative.

48:11.200 --> 48:13.640
So it should suit other cooperatives to food strap.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.960
And of course, if you want to start a new technology cooperative, how do you start?

48:17.960 --> 48:19.440
It's overwhelming.

48:19.440 --> 48:25.520
But now you've got this off the shelf project and it's like, get going.

48:25.520 --> 48:30.520
And once you enter it, you just see all the other collectives and you're like, great,

48:30.520 --> 48:32.600
we can learn, we can share, you know.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.400
And again, it expands beyond the technical.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.920
So we have the infrastructure for payment and bank accounts and all this stuff.

48:37.920 --> 48:42.480
So people can really get moving fast, I think, is good.

48:42.480 --> 48:48.480
And we want to expand the, you know, we want people to start technology cooperatives, start

48:48.480 --> 48:50.320
technology cooperatives.

48:50.320 --> 48:56.280
Yes, Enterprise Metrics, 21 collectives.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Somebody counted them.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.320
Maybe it was me at some point.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.400
But there's a lot of groups involved in this.

49:01.400 --> 49:07.600
If you go on the website, it's in the blog post, a list of them.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.840
We've got 160 plus recipes.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.400
This is a lot of open source apps.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.480
You could probably find what you need in there.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.240
And yeah, we're running 146 apps.

49:18.240 --> 49:22.320
I think I ran Abra app LS at some points.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.680
So Autonaut because heavily invested in this.

49:24.680 --> 49:29.560
And there are other collectives which are running the stack.

49:29.560 --> 49:33.760
Yeah, and maybe just kind of coming to the end.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.360
It's been a lot of details.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.520
I'm even overwhelmed myself.

49:39.520 --> 49:49.280
The last few slides, kind of philosophy take, you know, we wanted to be another project

49:49.280 --> 49:58.400
in the ecosystem and not just become the project in relation to decentralization, let's say.

49:58.400 --> 50:06.560
We really posit ourselves against this big tech discourse and what's happening.

50:06.560 --> 50:13.440
And we thought we could contribute to internet and digital infrastructure decentralization

50:13.440 --> 50:18.560
by proposing Cloud in its format.

50:18.560 --> 50:19.840
And we're only one project.

50:19.840 --> 50:25.040
So I thought it would be good to plug some other great projects which I just find super

50:25.040 --> 50:26.040
inspiring.

50:26.040 --> 50:33.360
And I would say Uno host is maybe one of the gold standards of community organized infrastructure

50:33.360 --> 50:34.640
hosting.

50:34.640 --> 50:40.240
It has a different kind of set of priorities and goals.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.800
Everyone can be a system administrator.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.680
It's kind of their goal.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.520
Let's make information available to people.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.520
Anyone can do this.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.520
Get going.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.800
Brilliant project.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.720
Whereas we're going for specific groups, co-ops.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.200
You're already in the game.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.480
How can we make it easier to keep going?

50:57.480 --> 50:59.120
So it's a bit of the different layers.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.280
But I absolutely recommend Uno host.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.640
Nubo is based in Brussels.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
Check them out.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.720
Chateau's great network.

51:05.720 --> 51:09.000
Co-tech is a network of cooperatives based in the UK.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.200
I think it's like 35 cooperatives.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.720
Check them out if you're looking for a job.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.520
Get stuck in.

51:15.520 --> 51:21.840
Social co-op trying to build cooperatively managed mass-on-instances.

51:21.840 --> 51:28.160
MIT, great collective already involved in co-op cloud at the moment.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.160
Small technology foundation.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.800
Always find this worrying.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.880
Check that out.

51:32.880 --> 51:33.880
Just plug in them.

51:33.880 --> 51:34.880
Yeah.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.280
Oh, five minutes.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.280
Cool.

51:37.280 --> 51:40.400
The roadmap is, as I said, building the federation.

51:40.400 --> 51:45.320
So now is a great time to join.

51:45.320 --> 51:52.520
As an individual, a collective co-op, please get involved if you want to.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.800
We're trying to find more money, of course.

51:55.800 --> 52:01.640
One of the goals of the federation is to achieve financial sustainability.

52:01.640 --> 52:08.280
So the co-ops that join or the groups that join the project will be...

52:08.280 --> 52:14.200
We're going to have to decide, all right, how do we fund development of the tool?

52:14.200 --> 52:20.680
And can we pay for hours around finance, admin, triage, all this stuff?

52:20.680 --> 52:27.600
Yeah, Kadabra is a kind of new effort to kind of have a server-side component which is...

52:27.600 --> 52:33.400
And this is the thing that Cloud Run did amazingly well, which is just auto-updating the apps.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.920
So we're trying to replicate that in terms of the server-side component, which understands,

52:37.920 --> 52:43.400
you know, oh, someone who takes care of that recipe has uploaded a new version.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.200
I'm going to roll it out.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.400
And yeah, web interface.

52:47.400 --> 52:52.920
I forgot to add maybe because it's still under discussion if we need that or not.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.760
Yes, getting to the end.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.760
I could do a demo, a chaos demo.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.160
Your demo or questions?

53:02.160 --> 53:04.520
Yeah, we have five minutes.

53:04.520 --> 53:05.520
Yeah, okay.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.960
Maybe I'll just do a chaos demo.

53:06.960 --> 53:10.400
So I wanted to, like, run...

53:10.400 --> 53:12.880
Yes.

53:12.880 --> 53:18.080
Just show you the command line client.

53:18.080 --> 53:24.840
So, again, to contextualize, this is the tool that people who maintain the service will

53:24.840 --> 53:26.520
be running on a daily basis.

53:26.520 --> 53:31.400
So it's supposed to make the job easy.

53:31.400 --> 53:39.600
And I won't go through all of that at the moment, but, you know, it's...

53:39.600 --> 53:43.320
You know, we try to take effort to, like, explain the concepts that are involved in

53:43.320 --> 53:46.600
the project and what you can do.

53:46.600 --> 53:59.440
You know, you can list all the recipes that are available from the command line, for example.

53:59.440 --> 54:04.400
And yeah, you can also do operations on recipes here.

54:04.400 --> 54:10.560
So you can, like, attempt to upgrade...

54:10.560 --> 54:11.560
Oh, I probably don't have internet.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.560
Yeah, right.

54:12.560 --> 54:16.800
Okay, well, anyway, you can kind of, like, do the maintenance commands on the spot.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.100
So again, you're on your local workstation.

54:19.100 --> 54:21.840
You realize that there's a new version of Next Cloud is coming out.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.400
Okay, let's get that upgraded.

54:23.400 --> 54:25.240
And then you can run the commands here.

54:25.240 --> 54:33.880
And that'll basically operate on this directory, Abba recipes, where you can see a selection

54:33.880 --> 54:35.080
of the apps.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.960
And then, you know, this is just the...

54:36.960 --> 54:39.720
What I showed earlier, the recipe repository.

54:39.720 --> 54:48.600
So this is the configuration that specifies how to deploy this app.

54:48.600 --> 54:52.440
Yeah, and there's some other details that I didn't really go into.

54:52.440 --> 54:59.360
But basically, one of the nice things that we've wired up is that if you deploy this

54:59.360 --> 55:04.120
app called Trafic, that when you roll out Next Cloud, it automatically configures the

55:04.120 --> 55:05.120
lesson-crypt stuff.

55:05.120 --> 55:09.040
So you just don't have to deal with this HTTPS issue.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.240
It's already in the config.

55:10.240 --> 55:13.280
You just say, give me a thing.

55:13.280 --> 55:16.920
Yeah, I don't know.

55:16.920 --> 55:17.920
Is there much more?

55:17.920 --> 55:20.200
Oh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

55:20.200 --> 55:25.360
And then there's just kind of this, like, command and control interface where you can see, like,

55:25.360 --> 55:30.160
okay, what apps have I got on what servers and, you know, what do I need to do?

55:30.160 --> 55:35.720
And you can kind of, like, you know, filter it by server or whatever.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.120
I won't type it out now.

55:37.120 --> 55:43.040
But yeah, maybe I'll call it a day.

55:43.040 --> 56:00.040
Thank you for listening to me talk for so long.
