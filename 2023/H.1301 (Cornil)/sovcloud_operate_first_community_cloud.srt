1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.080
Okay.

2
0:00:11.080 --> 0:00:15.540
Thank you for showing up in person and so many people.

3
0:00:15.540 --> 0:00:20.200
So actually my first time at FOSTAEM and I think it's super excited to see so many people

4
0:00:20.200 --> 0:00:26.160
and coming back to conferences but also such a crowded conference.

5
0:00:26.160 --> 0:00:30.720
So I mean the talks previously were super full.

6
0:00:30.720 --> 0:00:37.880
Now it's almost half full or half empty depending on how you look at it.

7
0:00:37.880 --> 0:00:45.640
And even for such supposedly boring topics like a sovereign cloud, I mean that's immediately

8
0:00:45.640 --> 0:00:51.120
sparked associations with state and GDPR.

9
0:00:51.120 --> 0:00:53.660
I mean all the cookies that you have to click away.

10
0:00:53.660 --> 0:00:59.720
So sounds boring at first but I think there's also some value in it and I think there's

11
0:00:59.720 --> 0:01:06.680
a journey where open source can help to make a sovereign cloud come to life or like look

12
0:01:06.680 --> 0:01:08.400
at some aspects of it.

13
0:01:08.400 --> 0:01:09.400
This is me.

14
0:01:09.400 --> 0:01:14.400
I go by the name Durandom on GitHub and on social media.

15
0:01:14.400 --> 0:01:18.360
Three days ago I changed roads so now I'm in sales again.

16
0:01:18.360 --> 0:01:19.360
Yikes.

17
0:01:19.360 --> 0:01:28.080
I'm a manager as a managed open shift black belt so I'm still looking at the cloud topic.

18
0:01:28.080 --> 0:01:30.120
Open shift is like a cloud on a cloud.

19
0:01:30.120 --> 0:01:37.920
Before that I worked quite some time on AI, on AIOps in the office of the CTO and the

20
0:01:37.920 --> 0:01:46.080
last thing that I did for two years now is imagining or revisiting open source now in

21
0:01:46.080 --> 0:01:55.400
the age of cloud and seeing how open source principles can also apply to operations.

22
0:01:55.400 --> 0:01:59.920
So we're going to look at the operate first community cloud.

23
0:01:59.920 --> 0:02:06.960
Why do we need a community of practice around operations?

24
0:02:06.960 --> 0:02:11.360
What does this community cloud look like?

25
0:02:11.360 --> 0:02:13.020
And also where is it?

26
0:02:13.020 --> 0:02:19.680
So I think this will be a, it's not really a hands on talk but you can take things away.

27
0:02:19.680 --> 0:02:25.840
You can if Wi-Fi works for you, you can log into the cloud right now and I hope to see

28
0:02:25.840 --> 0:02:31.520
you in some of the meetups or in the community after that because it's really open to anybody

29
0:02:31.520 --> 0:02:38.760
who wants to learn something about operations or wants to teach something about operations.

30
0:02:38.760 --> 0:02:47.880
So when I first heard the term sovereign cloud, like I said, it sparked the sovereign, the

31
0:02:47.880 --> 0:02:55.840
king who has now also occupied the cloud and I put it into my favorite search engine and

32
0:02:55.840 --> 0:02:59.040
it immediately came up with a lot of definitions on sovereign cloud.

33
0:02:59.040 --> 0:03:05.080
There was one from VMware, some from Telecom and they all looked at different aspects and

34
0:03:05.080 --> 0:03:09.120
these days in case you're not living under a rock, everybody's talking about jet GPT

35
0:03:09.120 --> 0:03:14.480
so I thought maybe let's talk to this AI who already read all the definitions for me and

36
0:03:14.480 --> 0:03:16.160
ask it about sovereign cloud.

37
0:03:16.160 --> 0:03:21.600
And this is just the end of my conversation so I wanted to highlight the differences between

38
0:03:21.600 --> 0:03:24.440
the noun and the adjective sovereign.

39
0:03:24.440 --> 0:03:32.880
And the noun sovereign refers to a personal identity that holds supreme power and authority

40
0:03:32.880 --> 0:03:39.120
while the adjective sovereign describes something that is supreme or superior in rank.

41
0:03:39.120 --> 0:03:45.560
That still sounds not really friendly to me like do I really want something that is in

42
0:03:45.560 --> 0:03:50.000
supreme power over me and why should I care about this then.

43
0:03:50.000 --> 0:03:55.000
But this is also a notion of independence in that adjective because that's what I always

44
0:03:55.000 --> 0:04:01.560
thought about when thinking about it a little bit.

45
0:04:01.560 --> 0:04:05.880
And Jet GPT came up with this that there's a notion of independence in the adjective

46
0:04:05.880 --> 0:04:13.120
to be described sovereign means to be independent not subject to control by any other person

47
0:04:13.120 --> 0:04:17.640
or entity which if you think about it that also implements if you have supreme power

48
0:04:17.640 --> 0:04:21.100
then you can also move away.

49
0:04:21.100 --> 0:04:23.800
And having the highest degree of power and authority.

50
0:04:23.800 --> 0:04:30.120
The term emphasizes the idea of self-governance and supreme power within a given context.

51
0:04:30.120 --> 0:04:32.560
And the context seems to be cloud.

52
0:04:32.560 --> 0:04:43.640
So when I look at sovereign cloud at least in my small world view it means I have the

53
0:04:43.640 --> 0:04:45.220
power to move away.

54
0:04:45.220 --> 0:04:52.960
I have the power to control stuff and I have that largest amount of independence.

55
0:04:52.960 --> 0:04:59.440
And that seems at first contradictory to that business model that we saw in previous talks.

56
0:04:59.440 --> 0:05:06.480
So somebody in a nice division of cloud is I'm running stuff on somebody else's computers.

57
0:05:06.480 --> 0:05:12.840
So that doesn't seem to be like a lot of freedom because I have some some lock in.

58
0:05:12.840 --> 0:05:17.120
But actually open source led a path away from lock in.

59
0:05:17.120 --> 0:05:22.840
So I think it's important that we apply these open source principle also to operations.

60
0:05:22.840 --> 0:05:28.400
And if you these days look at a cloud is it is it really open.

61
0:05:28.400 --> 0:05:31.000
I mean it's built on open source software.

62
0:05:31.000 --> 0:05:37.840
You get your RDS or some some other product and underneath.

63
0:05:37.840 --> 0:05:42.840
Yes it's running my secret it's running elastic it's running all that open source stuff.

64
0:05:42.840 --> 0:05:51.520
But you're still tied to that to that experience that the cloud provider imposes on you.

65
0:05:51.520 --> 0:05:56.180
If you want to rebuild that with open source solutions.

66
0:05:56.180 --> 0:06:00.680
You can do it it's it's looking pretty complicated.

67
0:06:00.680 --> 0:06:04.440
So you need to master a lot of these technologies you need to stick them together.

68
0:06:04.440 --> 0:06:08.640
And there's a reason for why people defer to the cloud because they are interested in the

69
0:06:08.640 --> 0:06:09.640
workload.

70
0:06:09.640 --> 0:06:15.720
They just want to swap that credit card and consumer build away the application.

71
0:06:15.720 --> 0:06:21.920
But I think the last speaker put it really or the previous speaker put it really nice

72
0:06:21.920 --> 0:06:31.520
that log in to be defined as a as a product of cost and the likelihood that something

73
0:06:31.520 --> 0:06:35.140
is going away.

74
0:06:35.140 --> 0:06:38.960
So you have to deal with that stuff.

75
0:06:38.960 --> 0:06:46.520
But open source somehow if you go to this slide here as an open source actually showed

76
0:06:46.520 --> 0:06:54.680
a way out of this and the last the left side of that funnel here is the traditional open

77
0:06:54.680 --> 0:07:01.000
source as in as in software contributions funnel which we all know for decades and which

78
0:07:01.000 --> 0:07:02.280
we all love.

79
0:07:02.280 --> 0:07:07.480
So you find a project you use it.

80
0:07:07.480 --> 0:07:13.840
There might be 100 users of it and at some point something breaks.

81
0:07:13.840 --> 0:07:16.880
So you might file an issue.

82
0:07:16.880 --> 0:07:21.960
You already contributed because you filed that issue and then maybe at the last time

83
0:07:21.960 --> 0:07:24.900
even somebody fixes or maybe you fix that project.

84
0:07:24.900 --> 0:07:32.480
So there's really a funnel of 100 users then 10 percent reporting issues and making up

85
0:07:32.480 --> 0:07:37.360
that community and 1 percent actively contributing to that project.

86
0:07:37.360 --> 0:07:43.320
If I'm using something as a service I'm essentially drowning this funnel.

87
0:07:43.320 --> 0:07:47.360
So I'm stopping at the at the API layer.

88
0:07:47.360 --> 0:07:56.020
I might contribute to the underlying open source software that might run this service.

89
0:07:56.020 --> 0:08:03.000
But in terms of contribution I'm usually I'm stuck with maybe filing in the support case

90
0:08:03.000 --> 0:08:10.360
and maybe the provider comes back to me but I have no possibility to actively contribute

91
0:08:10.360 --> 0:08:14.280
to that and maybe fix that API outage.

92
0:08:14.280 --> 0:08:18.480
But maybe I'm the only person having that problem and so the cloud provider doesn't

93
0:08:18.480 --> 0:08:20.520
even care about this.

94
0:08:20.520 --> 0:08:30.600
And this was the notion that our team thought about when thinking about open source in the

95
0:08:30.600 --> 0:08:37.160
age of cloud where it's where there's more value apparently in running and providing

96
0:08:37.160 --> 0:08:41.440
the software than the software code itself.

97
0:08:41.440 --> 0:08:47.080
Or at least that's on equal scale.

98
0:08:47.080 --> 0:08:55.240
And as we see with many enterprise distributions or business models you can get the source

99
0:08:55.240 --> 0:09:02.120
code of that database or that service but you don't get the sometimes you don't even

100
0:09:02.120 --> 0:09:09.120
get the built tools you don't get the tools that actually operate that service the SLIs

101
0:09:09.120 --> 0:09:13.440
the metrics that you need to run there the runbooks etc.

102
0:09:13.440 --> 0:09:21.360
So every deployment is either behind a paywall because that's the differentiating factor

103
0:09:21.360 --> 0:09:25.360
for that company or you have to learn it yourself.

104
0:09:25.360 --> 0:09:32.000
And it's actually quite hard to open up something also with legal constraints right.

105
0:09:32.000 --> 0:09:39.920
So you might have might have proprietary and PII personally identifiable information in

106
0:09:39.920 --> 0:09:46.400
in there you have logs so you need to make sure that you don't expose any of these secrets.

107
0:09:46.400 --> 0:09:51.920
So that there's a tight balance and that's why most companies or most projects default

108
0:09:51.920 --> 0:09:54.520
to close.

109
0:09:54.520 --> 0:10:01.560
And even for even for communities that run their infrastructure like the Fedora infrastructure

110
0:10:01.560 --> 0:10:08.680
that's somewhat open but you still need to be going through a lot of hoops to contribute

111
0:10:08.680 --> 0:10:10.780
and to do something.

112
0:10:10.780 --> 0:10:16.720
So it's not really open by default and it's also not meant to be as a blueprint for something.

113
0:10:16.720 --> 0:10:22.480
Only 10 minutes left but I think I can go to the next part of this presentation.

114
0:10:22.480 --> 0:10:26.220
So this is the this is the concept right.

115
0:10:26.220 --> 0:10:32.000
So we need to shift left we need to open up operations and practice something so that

116
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:37.920
we build up a community so that we don't have to build our operational deployments from

117
0:10:37.920 --> 0:10:39.720
scratch.

118
0:10:39.720 --> 0:10:46.640
And while that was this is the concept of this operate first idea we also thought you

119
0:10:46.640 --> 0:10:50.960
need to have something physical something hands on where people can actually contribute

120
0:10:50.960 --> 0:10:53.240
because otherwise it would be just a talk show.

121
0:10:53.240 --> 0:10:58.560
So somebody needs to lead the way and implement that stuff and we tried to build a hybrid

122
0:10:58.560 --> 0:11:07.800
cloud with full visibility into the operation center and hybrid cloud these days is for

123
0:11:07.800 --> 0:11:10.680
a lot of people Kubernetes.

124
0:11:10.680 --> 0:11:19.120
So we have two bare metal Kubernetes classes running at the Boston University with 34 nodes

125
0:11:19.120 --> 0:11:24.320
and 1200 cores so it's not a small setup.

126
0:11:24.320 --> 0:11:31.960
Then there's one larger cluster running in AWS from the OS climate project which is also

127
0:11:31.960 --> 0:11:38.640
managed with these operate first community cloud ideas and we also work with a German

128
0:11:38.640 --> 0:11:40.000
super scaler.

129
0:11:40.000 --> 0:11:45.200
That's what the layer below a hyperscaler means.

130
0:11:45.200 --> 0:11:50.960
Jonas they donated some hardware and we deployed also some some classes there.

131
0:11:50.960 --> 0:11:58.960
So my vision actually is to to have a really resilient distributed clouds set up operated

132
0:11:58.960 --> 0:12:07.000
under these principles at as many hardware or cloud providers as possible.

133
0:12:07.000 --> 0:12:15.760
Six hundred and twenty six individuals locked into these into these clusters about 200 namespaces

134
0:12:15.760 --> 0:12:19.800
are there.

135
0:12:19.800 --> 0:12:24.720
That's the so we do a lot of stuff on most of the stuff is happening on GitHub.

136
0:12:24.720 --> 0:12:31.160
We have 150 people on the operate first in the operate first community.

137
0:12:31.160 --> 0:12:38.440
There are like 1000 issues being filed.

138
0:12:38.440 --> 0:12:44.680
Since it's a red hats bootstrap project it's like one third or half of the people are red

139
0:12:44.680 --> 0:12:51.280
hat employees but there's also a lot of university contributions from American universities and

140
0:12:51.280 --> 0:12:57.480
also a lot of open source projects already contributing them.

141
0:12:57.480 --> 0:13:03.200
It's just a highlight of some some of the more noteworthy projects using this infrastructure

142
0:13:03.200 --> 0:13:16.400
like OKD the upstream of open shift or OS climate or Janus IDP which is a project for

143
0:13:16.400 --> 0:13:18.120
for some backstage plugins.

144
0:13:18.120 --> 0:13:26.920
So backstage it's currently one of the one of the more hyped tools for a service developer

145
0:13:26.920 --> 0:13:31.640
portal by by by Spotify.

146
0:13:31.640 --> 0:13:38.240
These are some of the services that are running there like the usual stuff that you would

147
0:13:38.240 --> 0:13:40.160
expect from a cloud set up.

148
0:13:40.160 --> 0:13:42.600
We have our city for doing get jobs.

149
0:13:42.600 --> 0:13:45.380
We have Grafana for monitoring stuff.

150
0:13:45.380 --> 0:13:48.760
We have Tecton pipelines for building things.

151
0:13:48.760 --> 0:13:54.440
There's a brow instance running for doing CI CD and a lot of other things.

152
0:13:54.440 --> 0:14:01.440
So every and that's all deployed by the community in a GitHub repository where you can integrate

153
0:14:01.440 --> 0:14:05.160
in into into these into these other services.

154
0:14:05.160 --> 0:14:08.720
And I think that's where the actual value comes from.

155
0:14:08.720 --> 0:14:11.720
So let's get real.

156
0:14:11.720 --> 0:14:20.840
We love hands on keyboard and as I said it's all done via a really a get ops SRE no a get

157
0:14:20.840 --> 0:14:24.960
ups get first approach.

158
0:14:24.960 --> 0:14:31.720
The current entry points for you would be going to operate dash first dot clouds or

159
0:14:31.720 --> 0:14:37.480
and that clicked through some hoops and you end up at the service dash catalog dot operate

160
0:14:37.480 --> 0:14:47.500
first dot cloud which is an backstage instance where we for one showcase the services.

161
0:14:47.500 --> 0:14:53.080
So you go to the catalog you see all these services with all their dependencies and you

162
0:14:53.080 --> 0:14:55.100
see all the managed clusters there.

163
0:14:55.100 --> 0:15:00.200
So you click on one of these clusters and you are presented with a single single sign

164
0:15:00.200 --> 0:15:01.640
on logging screen.

165
0:15:01.640 --> 0:15:07.480
And if you choose the second option operates dash first you can log in with your get up

166
0:15:07.480 --> 0:15:08.480
account.

167
0:15:08.480 --> 0:15:15.200
So it's authenticates against get up and without even signing up for an account you get a read

168
0:15:15.200 --> 0:15:19.760
only view of the cluster which is pretty awesome.

169
0:15:19.760 --> 0:15:24.440
So you see how these these services are being deployed and how other community services

170
0:15:24.440 --> 0:15:25.440
are being deployed.

171
0:15:25.440 --> 0:15:35.040
So you get a a a hello world example a live hello world example of a of of a fully production

172
0:15:35.040 --> 0:15:42.000
cloud environment which you would see at your at at your site either at your for your project

173
0:15:42.000 --> 0:15:46.320
or for your customer whatever.

174
0:15:46.320 --> 0:15:53.780
And we documented the way and the why we came up to certain decisions.

175
0:15:53.780 --> 0:15:59.120
So in this case it's application monitoring or there's also how to store credentials in

176
0:15:59.120 --> 0:16:00.120
a cloud.

177
0:16:00.120 --> 0:16:06.360
And these are the the questions that you will face if you're setting up a a your own local

178
0:16:06.360 --> 0:16:12.640
cloud and we documented these for to bootstrap either other deployments or to contribute

179
0:16:12.640 --> 0:16:18.440
back so that you don't have to really read through so many blog posts and documentations

180
0:16:18.440 --> 0:16:22.960
and make your own choice.

181
0:16:22.960 --> 0:16:27.600
There's some dashboards here and these are the dashboards that we use for troubleshooting

182
0:16:27.600 --> 0:16:29.680
or the community uses for troubleshooting.

183
0:16:29.680 --> 0:16:38.200
So you would see Kafka or open data hub and Prometheus live dashboards and here's one

184
0:16:38.200 --> 0:16:42.160
dashboard for our for our clusters.

185
0:16:42.160 --> 0:16:49.800
And that's the that's the GitHub org where you would start talking to us or talking to

186
0:16:49.800 --> 0:16:52.680
the community.

187
0:16:52.680 --> 0:16:59.560
The main entry repositories the support repository you can ask questions or you start with a

188
0:16:59.560 --> 0:17:08.280
one of these templates and one of the coolest templates here or processes is onboarding

189
0:17:08.280 --> 0:17:10.640
to a class as you get a form.

190
0:17:10.640 --> 0:17:12.960
It looks like a form it's a it's a GitHub template.

191
0:17:12.960 --> 0:17:20.220
You choose which cluster you want to be onboarded the team name and then we have some automation

192
0:17:20.220 --> 0:17:26.680
in place that would automatically create a pull request to our get ops repository and

193
0:17:26.680 --> 0:17:32.880
we only have to say looks good to me to it if you're for the person that's part of the

194
0:17:32.880 --> 0:17:36.080
operating team and they are onboarded.

195
0:17:36.080 --> 0:17:44.360
So that's also giving giving you some sense of how would I automate my local cloud's deployments.

196
0:17:44.360 --> 0:17:51.400
You don't need to do that but it's it's it's a way to bootstrap you and there's a lot of

197
0:17:51.400 --> 0:17:56.320
other issues going on and assets.

198
0:17:56.320 --> 0:18:03.040
It's a community so things will eventually also break right now we have problems with

199
0:18:03.040 --> 0:18:10.280
our object storage is broken if you are an expert in Nuba or in object storage and you

200
0:18:10.280 --> 0:18:14.320
want to get your hands dirty and rebuilding some of that stuff.

201
0:18:14.320 --> 0:18:16.240
This is the issue.

202
0:18:16.240 --> 0:18:24.720
So to me though here which will give another awesome talk at the end of this track here.

203
0:18:24.720 --> 0:18:27.720
Left some comments how to get started.

204
0:18:27.720 --> 0:18:28.720
Nobody worked on it yet.

205
0:18:28.720 --> 0:18:30.360
So it's up for grabs.

206
0:18:30.360 --> 0:18:32.360
Thank you.

207
0:18:32.360 --> 0:18:40.640
One question.

208
0:18:40.640 --> 0:18:50.400
Hey you provided a good definition for sovereign cloud.

209
0:18:50.400 --> 0:18:55.680
Who are the customers for sovereign cloud.

210
0:18:55.680 --> 0:19:01.360
I don't know to be honest so I'm looking at it really from a technical perspective and

211
0:19:01.360 --> 0:19:09.720
I think my key takeaway is everybody who wants to build their own clouds probably wants to

212
0:19:09.720 --> 0:19:14.240
be sovereign in running their cloud and then you have to focus on stuff like minimizing

213
0:19:14.240 --> 0:19:22.320
vendor lock in and being able to move to another cloud provider or move your data across clouds

214
0:19:22.320 --> 0:19:24.320
to jump just on the question.

215
0:19:24.320 --> 0:19:31.280
The transmission system operator is one of the customers that would like sovereign cloud

216
0:19:31.280 --> 0:19:39.120
because of the resiliency that we need to have because we have critical infrastructure.

217
0:19:39.120 --> 0:19:48.320
I think that was a statement not a question right.

218
0:19:48.320 --> 0:19:54.880
All right take out your smartphone snap that QR codes and there's a biweekly community

219
0:19:54.880 --> 0:19:59.160
meetup where you can meet all the wonderful people that are involved in this community

220
0:19:59.160 --> 0:20:19.560
well.
