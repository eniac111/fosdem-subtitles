1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.840
Okay, so thank you very much for attending this talk and obviously thank you for the

2
0:00:12.840 --> 0:00:18.280
organizers of the bedroom for accepting the proposal.

3
0:00:18.280 --> 0:00:23.920
So that's my name and coming from Open Nebula Systems.

4
0:00:23.920 --> 0:00:30.920
My idea today, I'm coming here not as a competitor of OpenStack, I'm coming here to talk to you

5
0:00:30.920 --> 0:00:36.800
about the work we're doing at the European level along with other European companies

6
0:00:36.800 --> 0:00:46.420
to align the geo-strategic interests of the European Union with what we are actually doing

7
0:00:46.420 --> 0:00:51.440
at the open source sector in Europe.

8
0:00:51.440 --> 0:00:58.760
So that's my email and you want to just follow up with any questions after the session today.

9
0:00:58.760 --> 0:01:05.360
As I mentioned, apart from being at the part of Open Nebula Systems, I'm also part of the

10
0:01:05.360 --> 0:01:09.440
European Alliance for Industrial Data, ETS and Cloud, which is an initiative I'll explain

11
0:01:09.440 --> 0:01:16.800
later today or later now, run by the European Commission and also part of another initiative

12
0:01:16.800 --> 0:01:24.000
we call sovereign heads, which I'll explain also in a few minutes time.

13
0:01:24.000 --> 0:01:31.240
Okay, so just to bring you some ideas, I'm sure most of you are already familiar with

14
0:01:31.240 --> 0:01:38.120
some of the concepts and the strategy, let's say, behind what we're doing right now at

15
0:01:38.120 --> 0:01:42.000
the European level.

16
0:01:42.000 --> 0:01:47.560
You've mentioned before and you're perfectly aware of the fact that the cloud market in

17
0:01:47.560 --> 0:01:56.840
Europe is, I wouldn't say broken, but it's not balanced at least, let's say.

18
0:01:56.840 --> 0:02:03.920
So these are just some figures of the growth of the cloud market in Europe in recent years

19
0:02:03.920 --> 0:02:10.320
and how the share of European cloud providers has evolved over time.

20
0:02:10.320 --> 0:02:16.960
So what we basically see is that the market is growing enormously, but the share of the

21
0:02:16.960 --> 0:02:19.040
European cloud providers is actually declining.

22
0:02:19.040 --> 0:02:27.240
So all of that business and all that value has been generated by also through the pandemic

23
0:02:27.240 --> 0:02:33.120
to cloud computing, that is mostly benefiting hyperscalers.

24
0:02:33.120 --> 0:02:37.040
So also you're perfectly aware of this.

25
0:02:37.040 --> 0:02:42.120
So we are now witnessing this kind of change of paradigm, so we are moving away from the

26
0:02:42.120 --> 0:02:51.440
cloud centralized model to a more decentralized approach, this shift of paradigm between cloud

27
0:02:51.440 --> 0:02:57.720
computing and edge computing, and that most of you I'm sure you're aware of.

28
0:02:57.720 --> 0:03:01.560
And we all know it comes with a number of benefits.

29
0:03:01.560 --> 0:03:06.000
We're talking about deployment of applications, ultra low latency applications, improving

30
0:03:06.000 --> 0:03:10.840
user experience, think about sectors like online gaming or healthcare.

31
0:03:10.840 --> 0:03:17.400
I mean there are a number of functional advantages to this, but from a European perspective there's

32
0:03:17.400 --> 0:03:22.760
also a key element in moving away from cloud computing, a centralized cloud computing model

33
0:03:22.760 --> 0:03:29.200
dominated by hyperscalers to a decentralized edge computing model in which other companies

34
0:03:29.200 --> 0:03:31.240
have a say.

35
0:03:31.240 --> 0:03:37.640
And that is to also foster here in Europe a new ecosystem of infrastructure providers

36
0:03:37.640 --> 0:03:40.760
that can bring some balance to that market.

37
0:03:40.760 --> 0:03:45.640
So we are assuming that the cloud market is dominated by hyperscalers, non-EU companies,

38
0:03:45.640 --> 0:03:49.240
that's honestly unlikely to change.

39
0:03:49.240 --> 0:03:54.000
What we can do is leverage this shift, this new paradigm of edge computing where we know

40
0:03:54.000 --> 0:03:57.040
there are going to be a number of demands for this new infrastructure that doesn't exist

41
0:03:57.040 --> 0:04:02.000
yet, or this technology that doesn't exist yet, to bring some balance to that market

42
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:06.040
and allow a smaller companies in Europe, for instance, to build their own infrastructure

43
0:04:06.040 --> 0:04:11.040
offering, bring that to the public with these new platforms, new technologies, hopefully

44
0:04:11.040 --> 0:04:15.080
based on open source, as I will explain in a second, and bring some balance to a market

45
0:04:15.080 --> 0:04:18.160
that's now heavily, heavily unbalanced.

46
0:04:18.160 --> 0:04:24.120
And to the point that we all agree and also the commission that we call it a market failure.

47
0:04:24.120 --> 0:04:32.600
So it is so complicated, so unbalanced, that now it's very difficult for a new company

48
0:04:32.600 --> 0:04:38.080
to get into this market and actually survive against these big players.

49
0:04:38.080 --> 0:04:40.040
Okay.

50
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:45.040
This is especially relevant in Europe because we have a powerful tool here, which is the

51
0:04:45.040 --> 0:04:46.040
telecom sector.

52
0:04:46.040 --> 0:04:50.600
And as I explained in a second, many of the initiatives that are taking place now in Europe,

53
0:04:50.600 --> 0:04:55.920
they rely or they hope that the telecom sector in Europe will come together and will help

54
0:04:55.920 --> 0:05:02.240
to build this alternative edge infrastructure that will be able to bring and offer an alternative

55
0:05:02.240 --> 0:05:04.280
to hyperscalers.

56
0:05:04.280 --> 0:05:08.640
We need to get the telecosm involved and that also means we have to fight sometimes from

57
0:05:08.640 --> 0:05:12.440
the open source perspective, but in general for this new change of paradigm, we have to

58
0:05:12.440 --> 0:05:18.920
fight against the temptation in some companies in Europe to align their priorities or get

59
0:05:18.920 --> 0:05:24.720
some agreements with hyperscalers to speed up the deployment of edge infrastructure in

60
0:05:24.720 --> 0:05:25.720
the market.

61
0:05:25.720 --> 0:05:33.160
But we all agree that this might come with some risks in the midterm.

62
0:05:33.160 --> 0:05:36.080
I think we all agree on that.

63
0:05:36.080 --> 0:05:41.760
So I'm going to explain today what we are doing at the European Alliance for Industrial

64
0:05:41.760 --> 0:05:46.160
Data Edge and Cloud and other initiatives that we're moving on promoting from the European

65
0:05:46.160 --> 0:05:49.720
open source sector.

66
0:05:49.720 --> 0:05:53.560
The main challenge here, if you think about what the future is going to be or what kind

67
0:05:53.560 --> 0:05:57.400
of challenges we're going to have in the future, in the near future, I mean, there are obviously

68
0:05:57.400 --> 0:06:01.200
there are many technical challenges and political challenges as well.

69
0:06:01.200 --> 0:06:05.520
A basic one, which we still don't have an answer for that is how we're going to manage

70
0:06:05.520 --> 0:06:11.800
if by the end of the decade we have, we actually have tens of thousands of edge nodes across

71
0:06:11.800 --> 0:06:15.360
the continent, how on earth we're going to manage all that infrastructure.

72
0:06:15.360 --> 0:06:21.160
How are we going to manage thousands of edge nodes with different architectures from different

73
0:06:21.160 --> 0:06:26.720
brands from all of those managed by hundreds potentially, potentially hundreds of different

74
0:06:26.720 --> 0:06:29.120
infrastructure providers.

75
0:06:29.120 --> 0:06:30.160
That's the whole idea.

76
0:06:30.160 --> 0:06:35.440
So how we bring all this new emerging infrastructure together, how we build the tools for a user,

77
0:06:35.440 --> 0:06:39.320
for a customer to actually leverage all this new infrastructure that's still to come and

78
0:06:39.320 --> 0:06:44.660
how to make that in a way that doesn't bring us against a new scenario of vendor locking.

79
0:06:44.660 --> 0:06:50.360
So how can we make sure that all these workloads can move freely from one place to another,

80
0:06:50.360 --> 0:06:54.640
we automate all these deployments, how to make this really easy for people to actually

81
0:06:54.640 --> 0:06:59.440
use this thousands of edge nodes that will be available in the market here in Europe,

82
0:06:59.440 --> 0:07:01.040
hopefully in a few years time.

83
0:07:01.040 --> 0:07:04.440
So that's a very specific technical challenge that we have to solve right now.

84
0:07:04.440 --> 0:07:09.000
And we have to decide how we fix that and whether we want to fix that as Europeans or

85
0:07:09.000 --> 0:07:15.680
we want to again rely on non-European organizations and companies to do this for us, which is

86
0:07:15.680 --> 0:07:17.120
very comfortable.

87
0:07:17.120 --> 0:07:21.680
But then at some point we realize we don't have the skills in Europe to take over these

88
0:07:21.680 --> 0:07:26.280
projects if something happens.

89
0:07:26.280 --> 0:07:28.720
So I talk about the alignment.

90
0:07:28.720 --> 0:07:36.120
So there is a gravel alignment and sometimes quite explicit from what the kind of the signals

91
0:07:36.120 --> 0:07:41.720
we get from the commission in this case and what the industry as a whole in Europe is

92
0:07:41.720 --> 0:07:46.480
doing but specifically the European open source technology providers.

93
0:07:46.480 --> 0:07:54.520
So there are some very clear declarations from top EU figures about the need to achieve

94
0:07:54.520 --> 0:08:00.600
this kind of technological sovereignty in some way or another, trying to coexist with

95
0:08:00.600 --> 0:08:07.200
hyper scalers but hopefully creating some alternative scenario for Europe.

96
0:08:07.200 --> 0:08:11.840
Happily there are also quite explicit declarations on the role that open source is expected to

97
0:08:11.840 --> 0:08:18.120
play in all this and there is a commitment to do this and I'm happy to say that the discussions

98
0:08:18.120 --> 0:08:23.240
we have within the alliance define these technology priorities and these coinvestment priorities,

99
0:08:23.240 --> 0:08:27.120
they are quite well aligned with the fact that these technologies have to be open source

100
0:08:27.120 --> 0:08:32.760
and open source is the way to mobilize this collaboration between different companies

101
0:08:32.760 --> 0:08:33.760
in Europe.

102
0:08:33.760 --> 0:08:37.240
Obviously that doesn't mean proprietary software is not going to be there because it has to

103
0:08:37.240 --> 0:08:42.400
be there and it's the base of some business models out there but open source is going

104
0:08:42.400 --> 0:08:45.120
to play a key role in all this.

105
0:08:45.120 --> 0:08:49.680
Again we see this aligned with what we've read from the commission through a number

106
0:08:49.680 --> 0:08:53.640
of documents that I'm sure you're familiar with and also with declarations from people

107
0:08:53.640 --> 0:08:59.120
like Commissioner Tereviathan.

108
0:08:59.120 --> 0:09:03.960
As I mentioned before one of the practical challenges is how we believe what the digital

109
0:09:03.960 --> 0:09:10.600
decade strategy says will have by the end of this decade thousands of etanotes across

110
0:09:10.600 --> 0:09:14.200
Europe how are we going to manage this infrastructure.

111
0:09:14.200 --> 0:09:18.440
What's the technology that's going to allow new infrastructure providers to offer this

112
0:09:18.440 --> 0:09:22.880
to their customers so that technology doesn't necessarily exist right now.

113
0:09:22.880 --> 0:09:29.400
That technology in any case we think should be European if we want to extend this concept

114
0:09:29.400 --> 0:09:35.440
of sovereignty down to the technology stack not just leave that at the data level or at

115
0:09:35.440 --> 0:09:41.320
the cloud provider level.

116
0:09:41.320 --> 0:09:48.280
We see also in the reviewed industrial strategy from the commission that the role that edge

117
0:09:48.280 --> 0:09:52.320
computing is expected to play in this and all this and this data processing that's moving

118
0:09:52.320 --> 0:09:58.640
away gradually quite rapidly sometimes from the from a centralized cloud to the edge.

119
0:09:58.640 --> 0:10:03.280
We're going to use that actually bring some balance to the market so make sure that European

120
0:10:03.280 --> 0:10:08.800
companies have something to say in that and it's not and the model doesn't replicate again

121
0:10:08.800 --> 0:10:12.240
the kind of oligopoly structure we have in the cloud market.

122
0:10:12.240 --> 0:10:17.360
So that's the role of edge computing and that's also increasingly the role that open source

123
0:10:17.360 --> 0:10:23.080
is perceived or expected to play in bringing different companies together to build this

124
0:10:23.080 --> 0:10:27.400
in the long term and maintain the whole thing running because obviously we can release same

125
0:10:27.400 --> 0:10:32.520
things but we need a long term commitment from the European industry not just to consume

126
0:10:32.520 --> 0:10:37.080
technologies but also system integrators as well not just to consume technologies and

127
0:10:37.080 --> 0:10:40.380
sell them and resell them but also maintain them in the long term.

128
0:10:40.380 --> 0:10:42.940
That's one of the main challenges we'll have.

129
0:10:42.940 --> 0:10:47.280
So the European alliance for industrial data edge and cloud that's one of the steps one

130
0:10:47.280 --> 0:10:55.280
of the one of the initiatives that the Commission has put in place in which the European industry

131
0:10:55.280 --> 0:10:57.640
is playing a leading role here.

132
0:10:57.640 --> 0:11:01.560
So it comes back from the from a declaration from member states the commitment to support

133
0:11:01.560 --> 0:11:06.680
these new technologies cloud edge technologies.

134
0:11:06.680 --> 0:11:11.320
If you read the this original declaration which they committed to expand spending all

135
0:11:11.320 --> 0:11:16.280
this transformation around 10 billion euros I don't think we'll get that much but it's

136
0:11:16.280 --> 0:11:21.240
as I explained later is that it is a quite decent amount of money in both in all this

137
0:11:21.240 --> 0:11:26.120
but we see in this even in this declaration there are already some references to at least

138
0:11:26.120 --> 0:11:30.840
something that sounds a bit like open source something so open source standards whatever

139
0:11:30.840 --> 0:11:37.240
that is but it's still it's good to see it's it's in there somehow.

140
0:11:37.240 --> 0:11:44.520
So the alliance was born in 2021 there was an initial publication of an industrial technology

141
0:11:44.520 --> 0:11:48.880
roadmap from a number of European companies at the CEO level.

142
0:11:48.880 --> 0:11:53.520
It was then launched at the end of 2021 by Commissioner Keirah-Ree Britton and I'm happy

143
0:11:53.520 --> 0:12:00.200
to say that by the end of February probably will be in good condition to publish the updated

144
0:12:00.200 --> 0:12:04.840
version of this technology roadmap with all the technology priorities that have been identified

145
0:12:04.840 --> 0:12:11.120
and deployment priorities that have been identified in Europe from the industry perspective but

146
0:12:11.120 --> 0:12:17.640
also in alignment with the division of the of the European Commission.

147
0:12:17.640 --> 0:12:24.600
The alliance brings companies private companies European only European companies member states

148
0:12:24.600 --> 0:12:29.400
and then also a number of experts are involved in this and in this discussions we had our

149
0:12:29.400 --> 0:12:36.000
first physical General Assembly here in Brussels in early December it was quite successful.

150
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:44.160
The ideas again as I mentioned align and then identify this investment needs these priorities

151
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:49.520
how to bring together the expectations and the needs and the potential of the industry

152
0:12:49.520 --> 0:12:54.160
in Europe with what the Commission is actually expecting or they vision what Europe needs

153
0:12:54.160 --> 0:12:58.440
in coming years and these challenges.

154
0:12:58.440 --> 0:13:02.440
Right now there are three working groups one for them one of them is for the four member

155
0:13:02.440 --> 0:13:09.800
states this is mainly people involved in discussions on procurement so they're looking at how to

156
0:13:09.800 --> 0:13:17.480
from that procurement perspective help European companies and cloud providers in the daily

157
0:13:17.480 --> 0:13:20.720
business with the administration in different countries.

158
0:13:20.720 --> 0:13:25.200
The main question we get from them is should we restrict contracts to European to only

159
0:13:25.200 --> 0:13:31.840
European companies and then it's very tempting to say yes but personally I will say well

160
0:13:31.840 --> 0:13:36.400
you take the decision I mean I'm not I mean as a company just that's something for you

161
0:13:36.400 --> 0:13:41.280
to decide obviously that will benefit us but I mean discussions are more complex but that's

162
0:13:41.280 --> 0:13:48.400
one of the that's one of the topics that keeps coming up many times.

163
0:13:48.400 --> 0:13:51.880
And then there are two working groups for industry one of them is the cloud edge working

164
0:13:51.880 --> 0:13:57.040
group that we from open ever we we chair along with another two companies with CapGemini

165
0:13:57.040 --> 0:14:02.120
and SAP and then there's a specific working group for the for everything that has to do

166
0:14:02.120 --> 0:14:08.840
with cloud for defense and aeronautics sector which I'm happy to say some of you were earlier

167
0:14:08.840 --> 0:14:14.280
this morning in this debate I had with the Gail from Eclipse foundation it was a striking

168
0:14:14.280 --> 0:14:17.440
for me personally to see all these people coming from the defense industry saying that

169
0:14:17.440 --> 0:14:23.320
they they want to use open source so the debates and the internal debates is not about proprietary

170
0:14:23.320 --> 0:14:28.280
source open source code or open source they want to use open source it doesn't need help

171
0:14:28.280 --> 0:14:33.280
to make sure that they can use open source under the very specific restrictions that

172
0:14:33.280 --> 0:14:39.200
they have in this sector so I think that's a good news for for everyone.

173
0:14:39.200 --> 0:14:43.760
So the alliance that not all the logos here because it's an old version but as you see

174
0:14:43.760 --> 0:14:48.880
some of the main actors in the European industry as a whole not just technology providers but

175
0:14:48.880 --> 0:14:54.800
people from from other sectors as well contributing to this cloud providers as well there was

176
0:14:54.800 --> 0:15:00.400
as I mentioned the first version of this document released in 2021 and we'll have that released

177
0:15:00.400 --> 0:15:05.920
in probably end of February so one of the ideas is also for those of you are familiar

178
0:15:05.920 --> 0:15:10.360
with all the different programs that the Commission has have has in place things like Horizon

179
0:15:10.360 --> 0:15:17.760
Europe or Digital Europe or SEV to to make sure that from from industry we feed the Commission

180
0:15:17.760 --> 0:15:22.880
with what's actually the challenges and the needs we have in terms of advancing all these

181
0:15:22.880 --> 0:15:28.120
technologies for cloud and edge and to make sure that the new calls and the new actions

182
0:15:28.120 --> 0:15:32.320
under these programs are aligned with what we actually from the industry identify so

183
0:15:32.320 --> 0:15:39.360
it's like given a quick channel to give feedback to the Commission to what this this this topics

184
0:15:39.360 --> 0:15:43.640
could could be in terms of helping us also advance that.

185
0:15:43.640 --> 0:15:49.000
So that is that's the structure of the of the Alliance I'm also here for to invite all

186
0:15:49.000 --> 0:15:54.680
of you if you come from a European company and you are I mean your business is relevant

187
0:15:54.680 --> 0:15:59.160
to cloud and I guess that's why you're here right now.

188
0:15:59.160 --> 0:16:02.600
There's an open process to join it goes through the through the European Commission you can

189
0:16:02.600 --> 0:16:07.960
join the Alliance you can join the different working groups and participate maybe it's

190
0:16:07.960 --> 0:16:11.480
a bit not too late for the for this new version but there will be new versions and new working

191
0:16:11.480 --> 0:16:15.760
groups through the rest of the of the year and it's a long term commitment from this

192
0:16:15.760 --> 0:16:20.360
companies to participate in this.

193
0:16:20.360 --> 0:16:30.600
So that's from the what the European Commission side has to do in the meantime from the more

194
0:16:30.600 --> 0:16:36.280
specific from the open source from the European open source industry where we've also been

195
0:16:36.280 --> 0:16:41.840
working in in having some more cooperation and collaboration among ourselves.

196
0:16:41.840 --> 0:16:48.640
In 2021 we launched kind of an informal initiative or community you could call we call sovereign

197
0:16:48.640 --> 0:16:54.000
edge it's about bringing together European open source technology providers that have

198
0:16:54.000 --> 0:16:58.680
some they develop some technologies or we develop some technologies in Europe that are

199
0:16:58.680 --> 0:17:03.420
relevant for for edge computing and this this change of paradigm and we think it makes sense

200
0:17:03.420 --> 0:17:08.120
to get closer to each other and get to know each other a bit better and integrations and

201
0:17:08.120 --> 0:17:14.320
all that and going together to to some of these projects that will be coming up in the

202
0:17:14.320 --> 0:17:16.120
near future.

203
0:17:16.120 --> 0:17:22.600
So we've started with an informal community of European open source companies we produce

204
0:17:22.600 --> 0:17:27.800
software and we already have some level of integration among ourselves the objective

205
0:17:27.800 --> 0:17:33.120
is at some point to offer an alternative stack of European open source technologies for public

206
0:17:33.120 --> 0:17:39.080
administrations and companies and systems system integrators also with making sure we

207
0:17:39.080 --> 0:17:44.300
have connections with all the European relevant European cloud providers to offer at least

208
0:17:44.300 --> 0:17:50.600
an alternative that goes beyond data and cloud it also covers the technology that sustains

209
0:17:50.600 --> 0:17:53.000
all this.

210
0:17:53.000 --> 0:18:02.200
We launched this as I mentioned in 2021 informally in 20 at the end of 2021 I'm quite proud of

211
0:18:02.200 --> 0:18:06.600
this we didn't get this money but I'm quite proud of this because this was the first time

212
0:18:06.600 --> 0:18:13.240
the European open source industry came together to apply a submit a horizon Europe project

213
0:18:13.240 --> 0:18:18.400
to the Commission we didn't get this money but it was it was a very nice experience to

214
0:18:18.400 --> 0:18:24.280
try to bring people who have never ever considered to to to go into to get into into a research

215
0:18:24.280 --> 0:18:29.080
and innovation project a European project coming together and preparing this proposal

216
0:18:29.080 --> 0:18:32.800
which as you know is a lot of lot of work.

217
0:18:32.800 --> 0:18:37.800
Happily we got it the second time so this is the COVNIC project it has started now in

218
0:18:37.800 --> 0:18:44.560
January we from up and able to coordinate this project with a number of other organizations

219
0:18:44.560 --> 0:18:50.380
involved it's going to be running for three years and I'm happy to say this is the actual

220
0:18:50.380 --> 0:18:55.480
implementation of this this initial collaboration between open source European open source providers

221
0:18:55.480 --> 0:18:59.760
and their research and innovation ecosystem in Europe to produce some some technology

222
0:18:59.760 --> 0:19:06.440
together and respond to some of the these calls from the horizon Europe program.

223
0:19:06.440 --> 0:19:11.560
And finally just to finish a very quick introduction to another initiative just that's now ongoing

224
0:19:11.560 --> 0:19:16.240
which is the import let me see if I get this right important project of common European

225
0:19:16.240 --> 0:19:19.720
interest for next generation cloud infrastructure and services.

226
0:19:19.720 --> 0:19:26.080
Okay so it's it's I says for friends we've been preparing this for what a couple of years

227
0:19:26.080 --> 0:19:34.760
or so this this is this goes to the next generation funding it's led by Germany and France with

228
0:19:34.760 --> 0:19:38.640
heavy support from the Commission and well in total it's 12 member states are going to

229
0:19:38.640 --> 0:19:42.440
mobilize funding from the Commission I mean from European funding through the national

230
0:19:42.440 --> 0:19:50.640
budgets state aid school to to set up this huge project for the for cloud that's continuum

231
0:19:50.640 --> 0:19:55.400
and at different levels we have I cannot disclose in the companies the specific companies but

232
0:19:55.400 --> 0:20:01.000
it's it's European industry telecommunication companies software developers coming together

233
0:20:01.000 --> 0:20:08.000
to cloud providers coming together to build a whole stack of the technologies and the

234
0:20:08.000 --> 0:20:15.320
advanced services we need for infrastructure applications on data so it's really exciting.

235
0:20:15.320 --> 0:20:20.080
It will cover a number of challenges that we went into the details here but it was we

236
0:20:20.080 --> 0:20:25.800
have it will be available on the on these slides but yeah things big topics like interoperability

237
0:20:25.800 --> 0:20:31.240
portability I mean meta orchestration across different providers avoiding vendor blocking

238
0:20:31.240 --> 0:20:35.600
and managing all this huge heterogeneous edge infrastructure that we expect to be in Europe

239
0:20:35.600 --> 0:20:41.600
in the coming years this is going to run we pass all the tests and all the questions from

240
0:20:41.600 --> 0:20:47.600
the from Digicompetition and the rest of the Commission it will start hopefully this year

241
0:20:47.600 --> 0:20:55.360
or the second semester so we've been running for five years and yeah that's my personal opinion

242
0:20:55.360 --> 0:21:00.560
but I think the components that we are we're building or will be building in this project

243
0:21:00.560 --> 0:21:06.560
they have the potential to actually come you'll see even when this is published the equivalent

244
0:21:06.560 --> 0:21:12.240
to the semiconductor or the hydrogen upside project that already approved but I think that

245
0:21:12.240 --> 0:21:16.760
these the open source I will be producing here hopefully will have the potential to become the

246
0:21:16.760 --> 0:21:23.880
probably largest open source project in Europe in the coming years so stay tough to stay stay

247
0:21:23.880 --> 0:21:31.720
in touch because that will need help and also an invitation for you to follow the this new

248
0:21:31.720 --> 0:21:54.600
project that we are we are starting now under the horizon Europe program thank you
