1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Let's go.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:16.000
Okay, so the goal also of this talk is to talk also about the progress and challenges

3
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:18.800
of alternatives facing the big techs.

4
0:00:18.800 --> 0:00:28.960
So I want to first explain a bit why apps is key, why end-user apps is important, and

5
0:00:28.960 --> 0:00:34.120
also where are we, what are we doing with these apps, do they exist.

6
0:00:34.120 --> 0:00:35.360
So first, who am I?

7
0:00:35.360 --> 0:00:42.360
So I'm Ludovic Dubas, I'm the creator of Xwiki, so I created the Xwiki software, so I don't

8
0:00:42.360 --> 0:00:45.280
know, does anybody, who knows Xwiki here?

9
0:00:45.280 --> 0:00:47.880
Oh cool, that's already nice.

10
0:00:47.880 --> 0:00:52.960
And we also created a second software in my company, which is CripPad, who knows CripPad?

11
0:00:52.960 --> 0:00:57.240
Cool, and that's pretty nice.

12
0:00:57.240 --> 0:01:04.320
And so we've been doing collaboration software for 20 years now, like 19 years, and we've

13
0:01:04.320 --> 0:01:15.520
been competing with software from the big techs, and it's not an easy thing to do.

14
0:01:15.520 --> 0:01:22.280
You get lots of challenges there in order to actually build that software and get to

15
0:01:22.280 --> 0:01:24.680
the level that you can compete.

16
0:01:24.680 --> 0:01:33.920
And so I've done this at the same time I created the company, so it was a business goal to

17
0:01:33.920 --> 0:01:42.760
be able to live from building these applications as open source, and we have 50 employees,

18
0:01:42.760 --> 0:01:48.600
we're a remote first company, and we have employees in France and Romania, and also

19
0:01:48.600 --> 0:01:50.200
now in Germany.

20
0:01:50.200 --> 0:01:58.640
And actually, we hire, so if you're interested, come see what we do, and we are currently

21
0:01:58.640 --> 0:02:05.480
having more success, and that's not happening every year, to be able to hire.

22
0:02:05.480 --> 0:02:12.000
So if you're interested, to see how it works inside a company that has a goal of doing

23
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:17.080
open source, of building open source applications, not only using them or installing them, but

24
0:02:17.080 --> 0:02:20.560
really creating them, come see what we do.

25
0:02:20.560 --> 0:02:27.280
So as a company, we're also a member of our ecosystem, we're a member of associations

26
0:02:27.280 --> 0:02:33.240
in France, for example, the Systematique, OW2, the CNLL, the ConsÃ© Nationale de l'Orgice

27
0:02:33.240 --> 0:02:34.240
libre.

28
0:02:34.240 --> 0:02:38.600
We're not a member of OSBA in Germany, but we actually want to be in its plans.

29
0:02:38.600 --> 0:02:44.080
We're also a member of Clidia.

30
0:02:44.080 --> 0:02:49.040
So Appel is actually a European entity over CNN and OSBA.

31
0:02:49.040 --> 0:02:58.320
We're trying to be active also in order to try to promote the type of things that our

32
0:02:58.320 --> 0:03:04.720
companies do, and I'm a strong believer that European companies should work together more

33
0:03:04.720 --> 0:03:10.720
than they do together, and I know how difficult it is, because it's super difficult, because

34
0:03:10.720 --> 0:03:17.880
we're all very focused on what we do every day, but collaboration is actually super important.

35
0:03:17.880 --> 0:03:26.680
So first, one thing is, in 1995, technology was more like you buy machines, you buy or

36
0:03:26.680 --> 0:03:29.680
you build software, you install that software.

37
0:03:29.680 --> 0:03:35.680
And not all activities in our lives were actually dependent on software in 1995.

38
0:03:35.680 --> 0:03:45.000
It was not that important, but in 28 years, actually a lot of things have changed.

39
0:03:45.000 --> 0:03:50.000
Now you're renting cloud servers.

40
0:03:50.000 --> 0:03:55.600
You could even run your server just on the cloud without worrying about buying a machine,

41
0:03:55.600 --> 0:03:58.360
just take the service.

42
0:03:58.360 --> 0:03:59.960
But you could also rent cloud servers.

43
0:03:59.960 --> 0:04:04.200
You could build and make your own software and run it.

44
0:04:04.200 --> 0:04:09.760
But also one thing is that almost everything, there is no business that's not dependent

45
0:04:09.760 --> 0:04:10.760
on software.

46
0:04:10.760 --> 0:04:16.000
It's really starting to be really hard to find anything that won't use any software.

47
0:04:16.000 --> 0:04:21.240
Maybe some independent agriculture people might not need any software, but even though

48
0:04:21.240 --> 0:04:26.520
might still use some of them to be more efficient in their job.

49
0:04:26.520 --> 0:04:33.760
But you have a lot of activities that are highly, highly dependent on software for every

50
0:04:33.760 --> 0:04:34.760
day work.

51
0:04:34.760 --> 0:04:43.640
And it can be a major competitive differentiator to use software in your business.

52
0:04:43.640 --> 0:04:47.000
We also see that there is a business in balance.

53
0:04:47.000 --> 0:04:51.280
Actually, these are numbers, so I didn't put the source.

54
0:04:51.280 --> 0:04:56.960
I should have.

55
0:04:56.960 --> 0:05:04.320
Actually the GDP of the tech sector in the US is 10%.

56
0:05:04.320 --> 0:05:09.000
There is data from Europe's websites where you see GDP is 4%.

57
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:12.880
So it's not easy to know if they're actually exactly talking about the same thing.

58
0:05:12.880 --> 0:05:19.840
The scoping of what is the tech sector is not always easy to match from one country

59
0:05:19.840 --> 0:05:20.960
to another.

60
0:05:20.960 --> 0:05:29.560
But we kind of intuitively know that there is much more tech in the US.

61
0:05:29.560 --> 0:05:33.600
And that actually makes a huge difference.

62
0:05:33.600 --> 0:05:39.640
And if we look at the problem from the sovereignty point of view, so what I try to do here is

63
0:05:39.640 --> 0:05:49.320
to look at the different levels of what we use in technology and what the situation is

64
0:05:49.320 --> 0:05:53.840
and how Europe competes from that point of view.

65
0:05:53.840 --> 0:05:58.280
But there are some differences also in the way it works.

66
0:05:58.280 --> 0:06:04.560
So for example, you might not know how to make a hardware component.

67
0:06:04.560 --> 0:06:07.440
You might not have the people that can do it.

68
0:06:07.440 --> 0:06:13.000
But once you bought it, the hardware component is yours.

69
0:06:13.000 --> 0:06:19.280
And that actually is something that is significantly different from the top where you might not

70
0:06:19.280 --> 0:06:25.360
know how to do the cloud service, but you also don't own it.

71
0:06:25.360 --> 0:06:26.520
You don't have it.

72
0:06:26.520 --> 0:06:28.160
You use it.

73
0:06:28.160 --> 0:06:30.360
You use it remotely.

74
0:06:30.360 --> 0:06:36.600
Now, it's true even in hardware, you're seeing evolutions where the world of software, the

75
0:06:36.600 --> 0:06:43.600
way software works, of SaaS software works, is starting to happen on the hardware level.

76
0:06:43.600 --> 0:06:52.560
Now, you can turn on a feature in a Tesla remotely, and you can turn it off also remotely.

77
0:06:52.560 --> 0:07:01.120
So we might have situations where we don't own the software that is inside a hardware

78
0:07:01.120 --> 0:07:02.120
machine.

79
0:07:02.120 --> 0:07:04.720
So you have a lot of hardware that contains software.

80
0:07:04.720 --> 0:07:07.240
Even a chip can contain software.

81
0:07:07.240 --> 0:07:12.080
Whether or not they can turn off feature remotely from the internet is another story.

82
0:07:12.080 --> 0:07:17.120
Software is something that you can turn on, turn off remotely.

83
0:07:17.120 --> 0:07:18.560
And that's something very important.

84
0:07:18.560 --> 0:07:23.680
Now, we're not actually looking that good all over the place.

85
0:07:23.680 --> 0:07:27.520
We know in Europe how to make some semiconductors.

86
0:07:27.520 --> 0:07:34.080
For example, RM, the European company, was almost acquired by Nvidia, but it didn't happen.

87
0:07:34.080 --> 0:07:35.320
But it's a UK company.

88
0:07:35.320 --> 0:07:43.800
So we still own a semiconductor company in Europe.

89
0:07:43.800 --> 0:07:48.480
We have some actors for hardware, but most of it is manufactured in Asia.

90
0:07:48.480 --> 0:07:49.560
So that's something important.

91
0:07:49.560 --> 0:07:56.280
And we know that with Covina, when we wanted masks in Europe, we didn't get them as fast

92
0:07:56.280 --> 0:07:58.680
as we wanted, as we needed them.

93
0:07:58.680 --> 0:08:04.880
So being able to manufacture our technology can be important.

94
0:08:04.880 --> 0:08:10.120
So now, cloud services, we do have European actors.

95
0:08:10.120 --> 0:08:17.200
But the good thing is that we have standardized open source tools in cloud services, so Linux,

96
0:08:17.200 --> 0:08:21.520
things like that, like Kubernetes, Docker.

97
0:08:21.520 --> 0:08:23.560
These are open source software.

98
0:08:23.560 --> 0:08:26.760
We don't always have the competences in Europe.

99
0:08:26.760 --> 0:08:30.320
We are not the ones that build them, most of them.

100
0:08:30.320 --> 0:08:34.240
But we do have access to the source.

101
0:08:34.240 --> 0:08:42.720
And we have actors, but it's possible to run VMs all over Europe.

102
0:08:42.720 --> 0:08:44.200
That's not a big problem.

103
0:08:44.200 --> 0:08:51.560
Now when you go to PaaS software, Platform as a Service, you have a major dominant from

104
0:08:51.560 --> 0:08:52.560
the actors.

105
0:08:52.560 --> 0:09:00.640
In France, there's been a complaint about the fact that the Health Data Hub, which is

106
0:09:00.640 --> 0:09:09.000
a national service doing statistics on health data, was run on Microsoft Cloud.

107
0:09:09.000 --> 0:09:11.200
And basically, a lot of people say, what?

108
0:09:11.200 --> 0:09:16.880
You're running health data of all the people in France on an American system.

109
0:09:16.880 --> 0:09:18.560
How is that protecting our data?

110
0:09:18.560 --> 0:09:20.960
It's not compliant with GDPR.

111
0:09:20.960 --> 0:09:26.400
And basically, the answer of the people that had made these decisions said there are not

112
0:09:26.400 --> 0:09:31.800
enough good APIs on the French Cloud services to run it on the French Cloud service.

113
0:09:31.800 --> 0:09:33.200
Obviously everybody said, no, there are.

114
0:09:33.200 --> 0:09:34.320
You have enough.

115
0:09:34.320 --> 0:09:35.720
There is enough to.

116
0:09:35.720 --> 0:09:38.720
Maybe you're going to miss a little bit of stuff.

117
0:09:38.720 --> 0:09:42.320
Maybe it's not going to be convenient for you, but it's possible.

118
0:09:42.320 --> 0:09:47.960
But basically, the argumentation was that it was not good enough.

119
0:09:47.960 --> 0:09:55.160
The ministry in France basically bashed the French companies for not being good enough.

120
0:09:55.160 --> 0:09:59.840
And the answer of the ecosystem, what are you waiting for to give money to the French

121
0:09:59.840 --> 0:10:03.040
company to allow them to be good enough?

122
0:10:03.040 --> 0:10:11.480
What are you doing instead of putting that type of service on foreign systems?

123
0:10:11.480 --> 0:10:16.720
So the technology, it's possible to develop it.

124
0:10:16.720 --> 0:10:22.160
A lot of it is open source, but companies like Amazon or Amazon Web Service, Google

125
0:10:22.160 --> 0:10:29.360
Cloud or Microsoft, are very ahead in terms of number of services that they have.

126
0:10:29.360 --> 0:10:37.080
When I looked at a company, what technologies are available to deploy XWIKI software and

127
0:10:37.080 --> 0:10:49.920
Cripat software in an app store on cloud providers, you have different technologies on all of

128
0:10:49.920 --> 0:10:55.280
them, but they all have a lot of options for how you would sell your software on their

129
0:10:55.280 --> 0:10:57.200
app store.

130
0:10:57.200 --> 0:11:04.040
When you look at what European companies have, they don't have systems to automatically deploy

131
0:11:04.040 --> 0:11:08.760
applications and sell them and put a price on them and people would start buying them.

132
0:11:08.760 --> 0:11:12.360
So they're really ahead.

133
0:11:12.360 --> 0:11:19.200
And when you go to SaaS, you have thousands of services all around the world, startups.

134
0:11:19.200 --> 0:11:24.120
We do have national actors and a lot of these actors are not open source.

135
0:11:24.120 --> 0:11:28.400
So you have a lot of SaaS services and a lot are not open source.

136
0:11:28.400 --> 0:11:35.440
And even the ones provided by Microsoft, Google and Amazon are not open source or they can

137
0:11:35.440 --> 0:11:38.040
be based on open source, but they're not themselves open source.

138
0:11:38.040 --> 0:11:42.320
That means you cannot decide to self-host them and take control of them.

139
0:11:42.320 --> 0:11:47.760
And that's actually something that we'll see is important.

140
0:11:47.760 --> 0:11:55.200
Now in the collaboration space, when you ask to the big companies what they need, they

141
0:11:55.200 --> 0:11:57.520
don't need one collaboration software.

142
0:11:57.520 --> 0:12:00.320
They need a whole stack.

143
0:12:00.320 --> 0:12:04.600
It was interesting in the previous presentation about the co-op, it was about deploying multiple

144
0:12:04.600 --> 0:12:11.280
apps and this is actually bigger companies want all these software, they need multiple

145
0:12:11.280 --> 0:12:14.840
software and they need them to work well together.

146
0:12:14.840 --> 0:12:20.440
So they need authentication, user management, they need of course email, chat, video conferencing,

147
0:12:20.440 --> 0:12:25.680
file storage, they want to edit documents, they want collaboration tools and then they

148
0:12:25.680 --> 0:12:28.300
even want to build custom apps.

149
0:12:28.300 --> 0:12:36.720
So they want a lot of different software and they want all this to be simple and easy.

150
0:12:36.720 --> 0:12:44.160
And when you start using apps, you become very quickly locked in.

151
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:50.720
Even when the app is open source by the way, when you put your data in a system, the way

152
0:12:50.720 --> 0:12:58.040
you put that data in makes you quickly locked because it's complicated to get the data out

153
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:01.320
and to adapt the way you work to other apps.

154
0:13:01.320 --> 0:13:09.080
Even if the app is standard, in 20 years of Xliki, I've heard so many people say that

155
0:13:09.080 --> 0:13:16.040
how they use to the fact that the button in Microsoft Office version X something, it's

156
0:13:16.040 --> 0:13:21.960
here on the screen and you give them another tool where the button is on the right and

157
0:13:21.960 --> 0:13:24.040
they say it's difficult to use.

158
0:13:24.040 --> 0:13:28.360
Like, okay, it's difficult to use, it's difficult to use because the button is on the right.

159
0:13:28.360 --> 0:13:32.480
No, no, well, they don't even know why it's difficult to use but it feels difficult to

160
0:13:32.480 --> 0:13:38.200
use to them because they're so used to the way they work before that it's very difficult

161
0:13:38.200 --> 0:13:40.720
to change.

162
0:13:40.720 --> 0:13:44.720
And we have been trying to move people from office to wikis.

163
0:13:44.720 --> 0:13:49.120
So imagine how they tell you that it's difficult to use.

164
0:13:49.120 --> 0:13:53.520
No, it's not that difficult to use.

165
0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:57.280
You need to adapt your way of working, you need to learn a new tool.

166
0:13:57.280 --> 0:14:00.080
It's not that difficult to use.

167
0:14:00.080 --> 0:14:01.720
It takes time to adapt.

168
0:14:01.720 --> 0:14:06.520
You need to try to think how it works and try to adapt your way of working.

169
0:14:06.520 --> 0:14:15.000
So the lock-in is very high and on SAS software, the lock-in is actually immense.

170
0:14:15.000 --> 0:14:22.980
I worked at Netscape in 1995 and we were talking about the lock-in of Microsoft on software

171
0:14:22.980 --> 0:14:25.720
when it was on-premise software.

172
0:14:25.720 --> 0:14:31.160
And it's like, oh, Microsoft controls your software like you're blocked on their software.

173
0:14:31.160 --> 0:14:36.840
But at least the software was in your company and you could put a firewall around it and

174
0:14:36.840 --> 0:14:39.440
potentially no data would go out.

175
0:14:39.440 --> 0:14:44.440
Here now it's on the cloud and so they will tell you it's going to be double the price

176
0:14:44.440 --> 0:14:46.640
to upgrade but you didn't have to upgrade.

177
0:14:46.640 --> 0:14:51.760
You could decide to stay on the older version for a bit longer and you didn't have to pay

178
0:14:51.760 --> 0:14:52.760
every year.

179
0:14:52.760 --> 0:14:55.240
You paid licenses for a long time.

180
0:14:55.240 --> 0:15:04.960
Now you're paying every year and if you don't pay on the 1st of January for your renewal

181
0:15:04.960 --> 0:15:10.080
or every month, they turn off the software immediately.

182
0:15:10.080 --> 0:15:12.520
So you're actually in an immense lock-in.

183
0:15:12.520 --> 0:15:18.680
The lock-in is actually way higher than it was in 1995 when a lot of the industry was

184
0:15:18.680 --> 0:15:21.120
complaining about that lock-in.

185
0:15:21.120 --> 0:15:24.480
And the data is controlled by the provider.

186
0:15:24.480 --> 0:15:30.240
There is a huge lack of standards on the structure of the data.

187
0:15:30.240 --> 0:15:38.480
So how that data, your basic formats are standardized but in collaborative apps, even in wikis,

188
0:15:38.480 --> 0:15:44.400
I have to recognize that the xWiki software formats are not that standardized.

189
0:15:44.400 --> 0:15:49.280
We tried at some point to work with other wiki providers to work on common syntaxes

190
0:15:49.280 --> 0:15:52.560
but never happened.

191
0:15:52.560 --> 0:15:58.280
Like our syntax was based on something called wikiCrayol which was discussed 15 years ago

192
0:15:58.280 --> 0:16:01.680
but now everybody is using Markdown.

193
0:16:01.680 --> 0:16:04.760
So there was something that people said that should be the standard.

194
0:16:04.760 --> 0:16:10.600
Like a lot of wiki providers discussed, especially said that that's a good common standard but

195
0:16:10.600 --> 0:16:16.440
it's a completely other one that a lot of people now say, ah, it's great.

196
0:16:16.440 --> 0:16:19.640
But not many people discussed the Markdown standard.

197
0:16:19.640 --> 0:16:25.560
They were just, oh, people liked it and it started to become very light.

198
0:16:25.560 --> 0:16:32.120
So the standards are very difficult to have even when they exist.

199
0:16:32.120 --> 0:16:34.640
They're not necessarily adopted.

200
0:16:34.640 --> 0:16:40.640
And so if they're not adopted, they're not very useful to move data from one system to

201
0:16:40.640 --> 0:16:41.680
another.

202
0:16:41.680 --> 0:16:46.040
The complexity of the software make it very difficult to switch.

203
0:16:46.040 --> 0:16:51.720
And one key aspect of the software industry is a winner takes it all approach.

204
0:16:51.720 --> 0:16:55.800
Like this is basically why VCs love the tech industry.

205
0:16:55.800 --> 0:17:01.600
They put a lot of money, they try to win, and they like the fact that when you win,

206
0:17:01.600 --> 0:17:03.360
everybody else is dead.

207
0:17:03.360 --> 0:17:06.240
The winner makes 95% of the revenue.

208
0:17:06.240 --> 0:17:09.720
All the other people fight for the 5% that's left.

209
0:17:09.720 --> 0:17:13.380
And they love that because that's actually their goal, trying to be the winner.

210
0:17:13.380 --> 0:17:17.320
So what's interesting is that they don't necessarily win that much because they create

211
0:17:17.320 --> 0:17:23.460
10 companies or 100 companies and only one makes it to being the winner.

212
0:17:23.460 --> 0:17:27.240
And so in the end, they don't win that much money because they drop a lot of money on

213
0:17:27.240 --> 0:17:28.240
the way.

214
0:17:28.240 --> 0:17:34.920
But this is their goal, basically, of what they're trying to do.

215
0:17:34.920 --> 0:17:40.280
And one of the problem of the lock-in also is unfair business practices.

216
0:17:40.280 --> 0:17:47.160
You have a lot of unfair business practices because the providers are so powerful that

217
0:17:47.160 --> 0:17:51.200
it's very tempting to use that power to make more money.

218
0:17:51.200 --> 0:18:02.860
So if you ask a business lead to make 10% more revenue next year, if there is no difficulty

219
0:18:02.860 --> 0:18:06.280
to increase the price because everybody's locked, they will just increase the price

220
0:18:06.280 --> 0:18:07.280
10%.

221
0:18:07.280 --> 0:18:14.600
It's easier than work hard to try to get new customers.

222
0:18:14.600 --> 0:18:22.720
And in order to keep that approach running, they also try to...

223
0:18:22.720 --> 0:18:27.400
Another approach is to, okay, let's make other people buy my second software.

224
0:18:27.400 --> 0:18:29.720
I have a first software.

225
0:18:29.720 --> 0:18:35.600
If I can force the other people, if I can encourage them to use it, I give for free

226
0:18:35.600 --> 0:18:41.320
the second software, then at some point they become used to it.

227
0:18:41.320 --> 0:18:42.320
It's free.

228
0:18:42.320 --> 0:18:44.680
And at some point, I say, no, it's not free anymore.

229
0:18:44.680 --> 0:18:48.840
Microsoft Teams is typically that approach.

230
0:18:48.840 --> 0:18:51.640
And Slack has actually complained about it.

231
0:18:51.640 --> 0:18:55.120
They actually sued about it because Teams was free.

232
0:18:55.120 --> 0:18:58.120
Office 365 is very expensive.

233
0:18:58.120 --> 0:19:03.480
They just gave Teams to everybody that has Office 365.

234
0:19:03.480 --> 0:19:07.080
And at some point they say, no, you have to pay.

235
0:19:07.080 --> 0:19:10.640
And all the others are dead in the meantime.

236
0:19:10.640 --> 0:19:18.240
So you have a huge amount of risks of lack of sovereignty associated to this.

237
0:19:18.240 --> 0:19:27.520
So if you can stop all the software remotely, if we disagree with the US government, knowing

238
0:19:27.520 --> 0:19:33.240
that all these companies are US based, if we disagree with the US government, they could

239
0:19:33.240 --> 0:19:35.440
turn off the software.

240
0:19:35.440 --> 0:19:41.840
And even worse than that, by the way, is that they don't even need to turn the software

241
0:19:41.840 --> 0:19:50.480
because they just need to remind our government that they can turn off the software.

242
0:19:50.480 --> 0:19:58.220
And then the other government will start being want less to disagree with the American government

243
0:19:58.220 --> 0:20:05.720
because they know it's possible or in negotiations, it could be vaguely reminded that it's possible.

244
0:20:05.720 --> 0:20:08.200
And that's actually a big problem.

245
0:20:08.200 --> 0:20:18.760
Our ministry in France of economy and finance said no political sovereignty without digital

246
0:20:18.760 --> 0:20:20.560
sovereignty.

247
0:20:20.560 --> 0:20:25.960
I'm not sure what they actually do to try to avoid that situation, but they actually

248
0:20:25.960 --> 0:20:29.400
acknowledge it, that there was a problem.

249
0:20:29.400 --> 0:20:37.320
That you at some point, you cannot state your political opinions if you're dependent so

250
0:20:37.320 --> 0:20:43.560
much on other people that have a different opinion than you.

251
0:20:43.560 --> 0:20:50.600
And at this point, I'm not sure how many businesses would still function if you shut down their

252
0:20:50.600 --> 0:20:52.160
collaboration tools.

253
0:20:52.160 --> 0:20:58.920
If you shut down Microsoft today, what's the impact?

254
0:20:58.920 --> 0:21:05.200
It's a bit difficult to deny, but how long would it take for the companies to start being

255
0:21:05.200 --> 0:21:09.140
able to do work again?

256
0:21:09.140 --> 0:21:17.160
And so from my point of view, that makes really collaboration apps very important because

257
0:21:17.160 --> 0:21:23.040
we don't have the control on these apps.

258
0:21:23.040 --> 0:21:25.600
And it's the primary set of tools that people use.

259
0:21:25.600 --> 0:21:29.040
Actually, I didn't ask that question.

260
0:21:29.040 --> 0:21:39.880
In your company, which ones are using Microsoft or Google?

261
0:21:39.880 --> 0:21:48.920
And so it's the primary tool that people are using, and they get really used to it.

262
0:21:48.920 --> 0:21:55.360
And it's also the primary authentication system that people use.

263
0:21:55.360 --> 0:22:07.800
Most companies will put Azure AD, active directory as the authentication system.

264
0:22:07.800 --> 0:22:15.620
And basically, they end up also being almost ready to deploy servers.

265
0:22:15.620 --> 0:22:20.400
So when you have Azure AD, you have an Azure account, you're one click away from deploying

266
0:22:20.400 --> 0:22:23.600
servers on the Microsoft system.

267
0:22:23.600 --> 0:22:25.880
So people buy Office 365.

268
0:22:25.880 --> 0:22:32.920
They tell people, ah, you need to connect Office 365 to Azure AD to manage your users.

269
0:22:32.920 --> 0:22:35.120
And then you're one click away to deploy servers.

270
0:22:35.120 --> 0:22:38.320
And a lot of users like simplicity.

271
0:22:38.320 --> 0:22:44.560
If it's simple to click, they start using the other service.

272
0:22:44.560 --> 0:22:49.880
And they do a lot of work to make all this work as easy as possible together.

273
0:22:49.880 --> 0:22:52.320
Do they do a good job is another question.

274
0:22:52.320 --> 0:22:57.960
But they have the possibility to make it easy.

275
0:22:57.960 --> 0:23:01.720
We might be happy that they're not always very good at it.

276
0:23:01.720 --> 0:23:08.520
And so that gives us some opportunities to provide other solutions.

277
0:23:08.520 --> 0:23:12.920
And so it's the entry point of all software.

278
0:23:12.920 --> 0:23:19.200
And the biggest problem from my point of view has been the bundle issue.

279
0:23:19.200 --> 0:23:24.600
Is that a lot of software becomes bundled as a package.

280
0:23:24.600 --> 0:23:31.960
And so when you go to Microsoft's website to buy, you say I need Office, you will be

281
0:23:31.960 --> 0:23:36.720
proposed the whole Microsoft suite, not only Office 365.

282
0:23:36.720 --> 0:23:40.400
And you will have this software plus this software plus this software.

283
0:23:40.400 --> 0:23:46.120
And you'll see that the difference of pricing is not always very high between the package

284
0:23:46.120 --> 0:23:50.360
with, and I'm not even sure it exists only Office 365.

285
0:23:50.360 --> 0:23:57.880
Only Office, you will get for free one thing, even what you don't need.

286
0:23:57.880 --> 0:24:03.680
This was actually the problem of computers bundled with Windows, which were bundled with

287
0:24:03.680 --> 0:24:05.000
Internet Explorer.

288
0:24:05.000 --> 0:24:12.000
I said I worked at Netscape and I can remember how it killed Netscape's business around the

289
0:24:12.000 --> 0:24:13.000
browser.

290
0:24:13.000 --> 0:24:18.440
When Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer in Windows, who would buy a browser if you have

291
0:24:18.440 --> 0:24:23.840
one for free with Windows when you get your computer, which at the time you were paying

292
0:24:23.840 --> 0:24:24.840
Windows.

293
0:24:24.840 --> 0:24:28.960
Well in the meantime there's a lot of things that have changed because now browsers also

294
0:24:28.960 --> 0:24:32.640
got free because you can make money through advertisement.

295
0:24:32.640 --> 0:24:37.400
But that's actually potentially a problem because you can make money through advertisement

296
0:24:37.400 --> 0:24:41.760
but we also got tracking thanks to that.

297
0:24:41.760 --> 0:24:46.080
So we get browsers for free but we get tracking.

298
0:24:46.080 --> 0:24:48.440
And that's also a problem of sovereignty.

299
0:24:48.440 --> 0:24:51.200
So now they bundle even more.

300
0:24:51.200 --> 0:24:57.960
They bundle apps but they also bundle Office 365 with the cloud, with the pass, with the

301
0:24:57.960 --> 0:24:58.960
yes.

302
0:24:58.960 --> 0:25:00.800
Microsoft has a whole offer.

303
0:25:00.800 --> 0:25:06.160
Servers, yes, a pass, and apps.

304
0:25:06.160 --> 0:25:10.280
And when you go see a client with you, ah I have a wiki.

305
0:25:10.280 --> 0:25:11.280
Would you like my wiki?

306
0:25:11.280 --> 0:25:16.280
Well sorry, I already have it for free in the whole offer.

307
0:25:16.280 --> 0:25:18.480
No, you need to, you know.

308
0:25:18.480 --> 0:25:24.480
And I even, I think I had a few cases like that, is for a department that's part of a

309
0:25:24.480 --> 0:25:30.960
big company, if they buy another software, they pay for it.

310
0:25:30.960 --> 0:25:38.360
If they use Microsoft software, the central entity pays for it.

311
0:25:38.360 --> 0:25:45.200
And it's divided and they pay the same share of it whether they use it or not.

312
0:25:45.200 --> 0:25:52.480
So basically you come as a provider and you have a cost and the Microsoft software you're

313
0:25:52.480 --> 0:25:55.680
competing with has no cost.

314
0:25:55.680 --> 0:25:56.840
It's free.

315
0:25:56.840 --> 0:26:02.840
But it has a cost in reality because everybody then will start, some people will start using

316
0:26:02.840 --> 0:26:08.200
some of these software and when they renew the license with Microsoft three years later,

317
0:26:08.200 --> 0:26:16.560
Microsoft comes and counts everything that is being used and they set the new bill.

318
0:26:16.560 --> 0:26:23.800
And so the company will end up paying it, the fact that they started using that software.

319
0:26:23.800 --> 0:26:27.320
And so it's very difficult to compete.

320
0:26:27.320 --> 0:26:29.280
And so everything's bundled.

321
0:26:29.280 --> 0:26:40.000
So actually Nextcloud has sued on this, I think antitrust.nextcloud.com, I think.

322
0:26:40.000 --> 0:26:42.000
I think I have the link a bit later.

323
0:26:42.000 --> 0:26:48.800
And so because it's a real antitrust issue, in the end you cannot compete with that type

324
0:26:48.800 --> 0:26:53.000
of situation.

325
0:26:53.000 --> 0:27:00.480
And so some people say, and especially this is true in France, on our government, they

326
0:27:00.480 --> 0:27:04.320
say we need to build better software companies.

327
0:27:04.320 --> 0:27:12.320
So the problem is not the way the competition works or the way these companies operate and

328
0:27:12.320 --> 0:27:13.320
so on.

329
0:27:13.320 --> 0:27:14.320
That's not the problem.

330
0:27:14.320 --> 0:27:19.160
The problem is we don't have a French one or we don't have a European one.

331
0:27:19.160 --> 0:27:22.240
And so say let's build unicorns and make companies.

332
0:27:22.240 --> 0:27:30.040
But in reality, when you look at unicorns, is that first, well, if they actually get

333
0:27:30.040 --> 0:27:35.240
very big, if they manage to get very big, they will behave exactly the same way.

334
0:27:35.240 --> 0:27:40.080
And it's not going to help the people and the small companies.

335
0:27:40.080 --> 0:27:43.600
It's going to be a bit less a sovereignty issue because maybe our government will have

336
0:27:43.600 --> 0:27:45.640
a little more control on them.

337
0:27:45.640 --> 0:27:52.200
But we are not going to get our own sovereignty because we're going to be very dependent on

338
0:27:52.200 --> 0:27:53.320
this big company.

339
0:27:53.320 --> 0:28:02.600
The other problem is that most of these unicorns are made with VCs.

340
0:28:02.600 --> 0:28:07.280
Most of these VCs are actually not even European.

341
0:28:07.280 --> 0:28:11.320
And VCs want to make money, so they want to sell the company at some point.

342
0:28:11.320 --> 0:28:16.040
And it's much easier to sell it to the ones that have the most money, which are the current

343
0:28:16.040 --> 0:28:17.280
American companies.

344
0:28:17.280 --> 0:28:22.960
So in the end, there is a very big chance that all these unicorns will either die because

345
0:28:22.960 --> 0:28:29.520
they don't work well enough, or they're going to be bought by the same companies that are

346
0:28:29.520 --> 0:28:34.320
currently leading the market.

347
0:28:34.320 --> 0:28:40.520
And another thing, yeah, and that's actually they usually use the American cloud providers

348
0:28:40.520 --> 0:28:41.600
for their services.

349
0:28:41.600 --> 0:28:44.720
And so these cloud providers see everything they do.

350
0:28:44.720 --> 0:28:47.120
So when something works well, they can replicate it.

351
0:28:47.120 --> 0:28:51.820
This is actually a complaint against Amazon, even in the US.

352
0:28:51.820 --> 0:28:57.480
That small businesses that sell on Amazon are showing to Amazon everything that works.

353
0:28:57.480 --> 0:29:04.200
And surprisingly, at some point, you get products that pop up made by Amazon instead, and they

354
0:29:04.200 --> 0:29:06.760
take the market.

355
0:29:06.760 --> 0:29:11.160
And so they're supposed to not look at the statistics, but we don't know what really

356
0:29:11.160 --> 0:29:13.840
happens.

357
0:29:13.840 --> 0:29:22.840
Now how can open source help to solve these type of problems?

358
0:29:22.840 --> 0:29:28.920
So one thing I believe is very important is that if you try to build local companies,

359
0:29:28.920 --> 0:29:34.960
French ones, German ones, UK ones, even though UK is not in Europe anymore, but still in

360
0:29:34.960 --> 0:29:37.440
Europe physically.

361
0:29:37.440 --> 0:29:46.160
That if you try to build your own local companies, and you all do it at the same time, at some

362
0:29:46.160 --> 0:29:48.880
point you'll have a problem.

363
0:29:48.880 --> 0:29:53.920
And because suppose one of them buys the other one, you're going to have one very big French

364
0:29:53.920 --> 0:30:00.480
company, or one very big German company, and maybe, I don't know, a Swedish one.

365
0:30:00.480 --> 0:30:07.280
And the problem is that this won't be sovereignty for the countries that don't own these companies.

366
0:30:07.280 --> 0:30:15.880
So, you might have a bit of sovereignty in France, but no sovereignty in Poland.

367
0:30:15.880 --> 0:30:26.080
And so if you try then to tell, so let's invest all, let's start using the software from this

368
0:30:26.080 --> 0:30:32.440
European company, like in Poland, they're not very interested to use the software from

369
0:30:32.440 --> 0:30:34.480
a French one.

370
0:30:34.480 --> 0:30:36.800
That doesn't give them that much sovereignty.

371
0:30:36.800 --> 0:30:39.760
So, an open source works very differently.

372
0:30:39.760 --> 0:30:48.360
If we invest in open source in France, it can be used in Germany, and it can give sovereignty

373
0:30:48.360 --> 0:30:52.320
to Germany because Germany can control the software.

374
0:30:52.320 --> 0:30:56.840
German companies can build competence on top of that software.

375
0:30:56.840 --> 0:31:01.160
And that's true in Poland, and that's true in Romania, et cetera.

376
0:31:01.160 --> 0:31:10.600
So, if we all in different countries co-invest in open source, we can all get more sovereignty

377
0:31:10.600 --> 0:31:15.960
out of it, and we also can get individual sovereignty out of it because any individual

378
0:31:15.960 --> 0:31:19.080
can then make use of it.

379
0:31:19.080 --> 0:31:25.280
So, I'm sure I don't have to convince that much about open source here, but it's important

380
0:31:25.280 --> 0:31:33.400
to remind these arguments which can be useful if you meet people in your own country.

381
0:31:33.400 --> 0:31:40.520
So, also open source is usually a bit more open to standards, and if the provider doesn't

382
0:31:40.520 --> 0:31:45.080
want to adapt this software to standards, then somebody else can do it.

383
0:31:45.080 --> 0:31:46.720
You have this possibility.

384
0:31:46.720 --> 0:31:58.040
So, open source will allow to adapt software to standards when providers don't want to

385
0:31:58.040 --> 0:32:03.320
do it because it's not in their economical interest.

386
0:32:03.320 --> 0:32:04.320
It's very hard.

387
0:32:04.320 --> 0:32:07.480
Like, if you look at software, you very often have a lot of import tools.

388
0:32:07.480 --> 0:32:14.720
You very rarely have export tools, but anybody can build the export tools on open source

389
0:32:14.720 --> 0:32:15.720
software.

390
0:32:15.720 --> 0:32:28.440
And one aspect that is also interesting is that we can reuse also US open source software.

391
0:32:28.440 --> 0:32:32.280
But we need, however, to build local competence.

392
0:32:32.280 --> 0:32:39.520
If we use massively very large US-based software, but we're not building local competence on

393
0:32:39.520 --> 0:32:46.760
it, we will risk having a lack of sovereignty because we don't have the people that can

394
0:32:46.760 --> 0:32:47.760
take over.

395
0:32:47.760 --> 0:32:54.600
So, we can reuse open source software from anywhere in the world, but it's also important

396
0:32:54.600 --> 0:32:56.840
to invest in the competence.

397
0:32:56.840 --> 0:33:06.520
So, if we start building massive solutions and not only competence about how to use them,

398
0:33:06.520 --> 0:33:11.240
but competence how they're built, how they're made inside the software.

399
0:33:11.240 --> 0:33:14.080
It's very easy to use open source.

400
0:33:14.080 --> 0:33:19.560
It's much more difficult to improve an open source software.

401
0:33:19.560 --> 0:33:22.680
You need to build competence on the software itself.

402
0:33:22.680 --> 0:33:34.440
So, now I want to look a bit at what actually exists because we're looking, and I've been

403
0:33:34.440 --> 0:33:39.800
maybe a bit looking pessimistic because it's hard, it's tough.

404
0:33:39.800 --> 0:33:44.800
But actually, what's interesting is that we have tons of great open source software in

405
0:33:44.800 --> 0:33:46.520
Europe.

406
0:33:46.520 --> 0:33:54.960
And I'm sure I missed a lot because I spent most of my time on our own software.

407
0:33:54.960 --> 0:34:00.560
And I'm sure I missed a lot, but I mentioned the list of types of software that companies

408
0:34:00.560 --> 0:34:03.240
are looking for for collaboration.

409
0:34:03.240 --> 0:34:08.800
And so, for example, in video conferencing, we have software like Jitsi, which has been

410
0:34:08.800 --> 0:34:10.400
created in France.

411
0:34:10.400 --> 0:34:17.040
Actually, core developers are in the US now, but it was created in Strasbourg.

412
0:34:17.040 --> 0:34:22.320
Big Blue Bhutan, Canadian, it's open source, not developed in Europe.

413
0:34:22.320 --> 0:34:24.480
Next Cloud Talk, developed in Europe.

414
0:34:24.480 --> 0:34:33.200
Only Office is developed in Letoni, if I'm correct.

415
0:34:33.200 --> 0:34:39.400
There are also issues around Only Office because it's linked to Russia.

416
0:34:39.400 --> 0:34:51.000
So we also need to have more control on it, on the development of it.

417
0:34:51.000 --> 0:34:57.240
Collaboration, Next Cloud, Xwiki, CripPad, project management, projects like Tulip, open

418
0:34:57.240 --> 0:34:58.240
project.

419
0:34:58.240 --> 0:35:03.480
We have a lot of software on authentications, software like Lemon L Dapp, UniVention.

420
0:35:03.480 --> 0:35:06.600
On email, we have Open Exchange.

421
0:35:06.600 --> 0:35:10.080
We have Sogo, BlueMind.

422
0:35:10.080 --> 0:35:15.040
And on file management, software like Next Cloud, PDO, CripPad.

423
0:35:15.040 --> 0:35:18.560
And on chat, we have great solutions like Matrix.

424
0:35:18.560 --> 0:35:22.840
So we actually have all the bricks existing.

425
0:35:22.840 --> 0:35:36.640
Now, they're all provided by different companies, different providers, and they're not as integrated

426
0:35:36.640 --> 0:35:40.280
as the other solutions will be.

427
0:35:40.280 --> 0:35:47.560
And another aspect, I'll come back to that, the integration aspect.

428
0:35:47.560 --> 0:35:53.200
Another aspect is that actually building open source business, it works.

429
0:35:53.200 --> 0:35:57.960
Like all these software have core teams.

430
0:35:57.960 --> 0:36:00.520
The software I mentioned, they do have core teams.

431
0:36:00.520 --> 0:36:10.920
Most of the companies, most of the software have a core team that is working for at least

432
0:36:10.920 --> 0:36:16.320
one company that has regular revenue out of this software.

433
0:36:16.320 --> 0:36:21.240
And they're able to fund the roadmap and have a regular development on top of this software.

434
0:36:21.240 --> 0:36:33.160
So it's possible, and I can attest of it, with my company, we didn't raise any money.

435
0:36:33.160 --> 0:36:39.000
And for 19 years, we've been able to pay the people in the team and grow.

436
0:36:39.000 --> 0:36:48.240
And we've even been able to create a second software out of the work that we were doing

437
0:36:48.240 --> 0:36:49.600
on the first one.

438
0:36:49.600 --> 0:36:54.480
So it's possible to fund the company.

439
0:36:54.480 --> 0:36:57.560
Now at the beginning, it's not easy.

440
0:36:57.560 --> 0:37:03.120
Like the first years, you need to build critical mass.

441
0:37:03.120 --> 0:37:05.800
And sometimes you have an issue of competition.

442
0:37:05.800 --> 0:37:16.640
So you're not necessarily finding enough money to build it quickly at the level that it can

443
0:37:16.640 --> 0:37:17.640
compete.

444
0:37:17.640 --> 0:37:20.160
But it's possible to find business.

445
0:37:20.160 --> 0:37:22.560
And it progresses.

446
0:37:22.560 --> 0:37:27.280
The better your software is, the more companies are interested in it.

447
0:37:27.280 --> 0:37:30.880
When it's good enough, the companies get interested in it.

448
0:37:30.880 --> 0:37:35.960
So you have moments where companies will just go to the other provider.

449
0:37:35.960 --> 0:37:37.800
So winner takes it all.

450
0:37:37.800 --> 0:37:39.880
So you get very little market share.

451
0:37:39.880 --> 0:37:41.880
But then at some point, they get more interested.

452
0:37:41.880 --> 0:37:45.640
And you get more prospects.

453
0:37:45.640 --> 0:37:51.200
So how does open source business work?

454
0:37:51.200 --> 0:37:52.200
Clients do buy support.

455
0:37:52.200 --> 0:37:54.800
But you need also to have the price right.

456
0:37:54.800 --> 0:38:01.760
So if you put it too expensive, then clients might just go away.

457
0:38:01.760 --> 0:38:06.080
But if you put the right price, you get clients that buy support.

458
0:38:06.080 --> 0:38:10.920
You also have clients that sponsor development.

459
0:38:10.920 --> 0:38:17.080
But you have issues of dumping and bundling that slows it down.

460
0:38:17.080 --> 0:38:25.080
You cannot sell to everybody because you have competitors and their software is given for

461
0:38:25.080 --> 0:38:26.720
free or cheaper.

462
0:38:26.720 --> 0:38:34.920
And Xwiki knows it very well because we've been competing with Xwiki with conference.

463
0:38:34.920 --> 0:38:37.260
Anybody has conferences in their company.

464
0:38:37.260 --> 0:38:43.920
So while you can try to convince your companies to switch to Xwiki, we have importers.

465
0:38:43.920 --> 0:38:49.120
And Atlassian has kept increased the price over the time.

466
0:38:49.120 --> 0:38:52.720
And they actually changed a lot the strategy.

467
0:38:52.720 --> 0:38:57.180
So they had a pretty low price for small businesses.

468
0:38:57.180 --> 0:39:01.080
And now they say small businesses, you have to go on the cloud.

469
0:39:01.080 --> 0:39:06.960
We stop doing the small priced software, even though it makes money.

470
0:39:06.960 --> 0:39:10.360
If you look at the finances of Atlassian, it does make money.

471
0:39:10.360 --> 0:39:13.880
So it's a conscious choice to make more money.

472
0:39:13.880 --> 0:39:15.920
It's not something that doesn't work.

473
0:39:15.920 --> 0:39:17.240
It's something that works.

474
0:39:17.240 --> 0:39:24.160
But now that they've done that, we have a lot of calls and we get much more clients.

475
0:39:24.160 --> 0:39:28.840
And even though we never got the money of these clients to build our own software.

476
0:39:28.840 --> 0:39:32.880
So we've been able to build the software with the money of other clients.

477
0:39:32.880 --> 0:39:35.500
And now we're having more clients coming.

478
0:39:35.500 --> 0:39:42.680
So I think it's a clear proof that the dumping and the bundling approaches are slowing down

479
0:39:42.680 --> 0:39:48.480
open source and there are unfair practices.

480
0:39:48.480 --> 0:39:49.960
There are also some good news.

481
0:39:49.960 --> 0:39:53.040
For example, European initiatives, NGI.

482
0:39:53.040 --> 0:39:59.640
So we at Xwiki, we've been able to benefit from that on CripAd in particular.

483
0:39:59.640 --> 0:40:02.200
Because CripAd doesn't have that many clients.

484
0:40:02.200 --> 0:40:04.440
There has almost no enterprise clients.

485
0:40:04.440 --> 0:40:07.000
It's just starting to have enterprise clients.

486
0:40:07.000 --> 0:40:11.480
And it's been mostly funded with research money.

487
0:40:11.480 --> 0:40:13.240
We do have some clients.

488
0:40:13.240 --> 0:40:18.880
We have donations and subscriptions on our instance.

489
0:40:18.880 --> 0:40:26.920
But it would not be enough to pay for that software, which requires a lot of work.

490
0:40:26.920 --> 0:40:33.560
And so NGI is providing funding for companies and that's really a great thing.

491
0:40:33.560 --> 0:40:39.960
There also the EU started to pay for bug bounties on open source software.

492
0:40:39.960 --> 0:40:43.720
We've been able to benefit from it also.

493
0:40:43.720 --> 0:40:44.880
And that's been great.

494
0:40:44.880 --> 0:40:52.200
Gaiyaks is interesting, but there are also issues with it from my point of view.

495
0:40:52.200 --> 0:41:01.300
It's not easy to understand, to see how four small providers like us that are doing apps,

496
0:41:01.300 --> 0:41:08.600
how to work together with the big cloud providers and big companies that are currently running

497
0:41:08.600 --> 0:41:10.120
Gaiyaks.

498
0:41:10.120 --> 0:41:17.840
We're not seeing also open source being put in front in the Gaiyaks project.

499
0:41:17.840 --> 0:41:21.160
So there are initiatives in Europe to help.

500
0:41:21.160 --> 0:41:25.120
And we've seen that it's becoming more and more in subject.

501
0:41:25.120 --> 0:41:26.680
That's interesting.

502
0:41:26.680 --> 0:41:31.360
In France, we have the French government decided to put some funding.

503
0:41:31.360 --> 0:41:35.760
So on one side, they're opening the door to American software.

504
0:41:35.760 --> 0:41:43.400
They also reacted to the fact that from the GDPR perspective, there is a huge problem

505
0:41:43.400 --> 0:41:44.480
with the Cloud Act.

506
0:41:44.480 --> 0:41:48.440
This is the Max Shramps Act.

507
0:41:48.440 --> 0:41:56.320
And basically, they're recognizing that it's illegal to host data on American companies'

508
0:41:56.320 --> 0:41:58.280
systems.

509
0:41:58.280 --> 0:42:05.240
But it seems to be illegal, but we don't really know if they consider it illegal for everybody.

510
0:42:05.240 --> 0:42:10.280
Is it illegal only for the public service?

511
0:42:10.280 --> 0:42:12.000
It's illegal for all the companies?

512
0:42:12.000 --> 0:42:13.000
It's unclear.

513
0:42:13.000 --> 0:42:18.480
But they started to say, OK, for example, the national education should not use Microsoft,

514
0:42:18.480 --> 0:42:22.680
should not deploy Microsoft software anymore.

515
0:42:22.680 --> 0:42:28.600
But on the other side, they're proposing that French companies are going to build clouds

516
0:42:28.600 --> 0:42:36.640
to deploy Microsoft and Google software on them and host it instead of Microsoft and

517
0:42:36.640 --> 0:42:37.640
Google.

518
0:42:37.640 --> 0:42:40.200
And that will be OK.

519
0:42:40.200 --> 0:42:44.640
So they will control the software, but they won't control the hosting, but they won't

520
0:42:44.640 --> 0:42:47.800
control the software.

521
0:42:47.800 --> 0:42:51.120
On the other side, they say, OK, let's fund a little bit of alternatives.

522
0:42:51.120 --> 0:42:55.960
So they decided to put 50 million, but they didn't put it on open source.

523
0:42:55.960 --> 0:43:01.840
We have partners in some of the projects to try to get funding for XWIKI and CripPad

524
0:43:01.840 --> 0:43:05.400
and try to build also additional solutions.

525
0:43:05.400 --> 0:43:09.320
So you have a bit of a mixed message on one side.

526
0:43:09.320 --> 0:43:10.320
They like open source.

527
0:43:10.320 --> 0:43:14.520
On the other side, they don't promote only open source.

528
0:43:14.520 --> 0:43:17.760
So it's not always clear.

529
0:43:17.760 --> 0:43:19.320
So you have messages.

530
0:43:19.320 --> 0:43:28.200
There are better news in Germany, where you have specific funding for open source platforms

531
0:43:28.200 --> 0:43:31.880
with the sovereign workplace project.

532
0:43:31.880 --> 0:43:36.480
Actually at XWIKI, we have had the chance to be called in.

533
0:43:36.480 --> 0:43:39.440
And that is actually great news for us.

534
0:43:39.440 --> 0:43:44.200
And you have a bunch of great open source software that are part of that project.

535
0:43:44.200 --> 0:43:50.120
You also have additional initiatives like the sovereign tech fund, and there is a specific

536
0:43:50.120 --> 0:43:55.160
entity called the Centrum for Digital Superimitate.

537
0:43:55.160 --> 0:43:59.480
Then this, my German is good.

538
0:43:59.480 --> 0:44:00.800
And you have the open code project.

539
0:44:00.800 --> 0:44:06.640
So a bit better news, but at the same time, it's never completely won.

540
0:44:06.640 --> 0:44:13.600
You have internally a government, some people pro and some people that will continue to

541
0:44:13.600 --> 0:44:17.760
push for, oh, it's not so important.

542
0:44:17.760 --> 0:44:20.560
Let's use American software.

543
0:44:20.560 --> 0:44:25.600
So the challenges, I've talked about them.

544
0:44:25.600 --> 0:44:32.680
The antitrust is clearly bundling and unfair practices and trying to kill competition with

545
0:44:32.680 --> 0:44:35.480
aggressive pricing.

546
0:44:35.480 --> 0:44:37.480
I've seen cloud develop.

547
0:44:37.480 --> 0:44:44.720
I mean, the typical cloud business model is let's give things for free and then increase

548
0:44:44.720 --> 0:44:45.720
the price.

549
0:44:45.720 --> 0:44:51.600
Let's get the users when they're in, when I'm sufficiently known, let's change the price.

550
0:44:51.600 --> 0:44:54.440
You could say open source does the same thing.

551
0:44:54.440 --> 0:44:56.680
Let's make it open source.

552
0:44:56.680 --> 0:45:04.520
And at some point, let's give it for free and let's change the price or let's stop being

553
0:45:04.520 --> 0:45:05.520
open source.

554
0:45:05.520 --> 0:45:07.200
So some companies do it.

555
0:45:07.200 --> 0:45:09.680
There is a big difference.

556
0:45:09.680 --> 0:45:14.720
However, is that what you put as open source, you can never take away.

557
0:45:14.720 --> 0:45:22.200
So maybe you can change your price, stop, do open source and do your own life and turn

558
0:45:22.200 --> 0:45:28.960
your back on the people that helped you because you have a lot of people that help you when

559
0:45:28.960 --> 0:45:30.280
you do open source.

560
0:45:30.280 --> 0:45:33.600
You give them a lot, but they also give you a lot.

561
0:45:33.600 --> 0:45:38.800
I can say that I have a lot of people that gave us things, gave us contribution, make

562
0:45:38.800 --> 0:45:40.400
the software known.

563
0:45:40.400 --> 0:45:46.920
The users' crypto platform wouldn't be what it is with all the people making it known.

564
0:45:46.920 --> 0:45:48.440
So we have a lot of people helping.

565
0:45:48.440 --> 0:45:51.680
So you can do that, but you can never take away the code.

566
0:45:51.680 --> 0:45:57.720
And that's a very, very important difference versus a strategy of the cloud providers that

567
0:45:57.720 --> 0:46:02.280
gives things for free and increase the price later.

568
0:46:02.280 --> 0:46:08.640
And this is also why on my side, I'm a big proponent of a GPL with no CLA.

569
0:46:08.640 --> 0:46:18.120
So no retaining the copyright of everything that people give you because this shows that

570
0:46:18.120 --> 0:46:24.760
you will not turn your back on open source or at least you will have to give back all

571
0:46:24.760 --> 0:46:31.280
the code and redo what people gave you.

572
0:46:31.280 --> 0:46:32.920
For CripAd, it's a GPL.

573
0:46:32.920 --> 0:46:35.280
Xweek is LGPL.

574
0:46:35.280 --> 0:46:39.200
And we don't want to change it because this is what we did and we don't want to change

575
0:46:39.200 --> 0:46:40.200
that.

576
0:46:40.200 --> 0:46:46.160
But CripAd is a GPL and we have never taken any CLA on contributions.

577
0:46:46.160 --> 0:46:53.720
And we believe we cannot go away of what we're doing.

578
0:46:53.720 --> 0:46:56.920
There is another challenge, which is open source financing.

579
0:46:56.920 --> 0:47:02.480
So the initial financing of an open source project is very difficult.

580
0:47:02.480 --> 0:47:06.160
It's something that is tough.

581
0:47:06.160 --> 0:47:10.640
There is one thing that is very important is that a lot of people, when they build open

582
0:47:10.640 --> 0:47:18.000
source software and they try to live from it, they question the open source business

583
0:47:18.000 --> 0:47:19.000
model.

584
0:47:19.000 --> 0:47:23.480
Is that, yeah, but somebody is going to steal my software or somebody is going to compete

585
0:47:23.480 --> 0:47:25.520
with me, et cetera, et cetera.

586
0:47:25.520 --> 0:47:27.040
And you have difficulties.

587
0:47:27.040 --> 0:47:28.880
You always have difficulties.

588
0:47:28.880 --> 0:47:34.680
But sometimes it's very important to understand that the main difficulty is not the business

589
0:47:34.680 --> 0:47:35.680
model.

590
0:47:35.680 --> 0:47:39.360
The main difficulty is do a good enough software.

591
0:47:39.360 --> 0:47:48.520
In many cases, when you tend to think that you should be selling it, you should be selling

592
0:47:48.520 --> 0:47:54.320
it instead of giving it away as open source, well, sometimes that's not the problem.

593
0:47:54.320 --> 0:47:56.440
The problem is that the software is not good enough.

594
0:47:56.440 --> 0:47:57.640
You need to be better.

595
0:47:57.640 --> 0:48:00.560
The competition is too good.

596
0:48:00.560 --> 0:48:03.080
And you need to work more on your software.

597
0:48:03.080 --> 0:48:06.400
We had phases where it was a bit difficult at XWiki.

598
0:48:06.400 --> 0:48:11.640
And what we did, we worked on the software and things improved.

599
0:48:11.640 --> 0:48:15.880
So you have to look at that.

600
0:48:15.880 --> 0:48:23.960
We also decided at XWiki to do extensions that are open source but paying.

601
0:48:23.960 --> 0:48:28.560
And so I usually have a bit of a complexity to explain that.

602
0:48:28.560 --> 0:48:39.760
I even had some people that said, so they asked, but can I take it or can I reuse it

603
0:48:39.760 --> 0:48:40.760
for free?

604
0:48:40.760 --> 0:48:47.480
I said, yeah, take the source, rebuild it, remove the license check, and you can use

605
0:48:47.480 --> 0:48:48.480
it.

606
0:48:48.480 --> 0:48:49.480
It's open source.

607
0:48:49.480 --> 0:48:51.240
So it's not open source.

608
0:48:51.240 --> 0:48:52.600
I cannot use it for free.

609
0:48:52.600 --> 0:48:54.200
No, that's not open source.

610
0:48:54.200 --> 0:48:55.200
It's about the source.

611
0:48:55.200 --> 0:48:59.880
It's not about whether or not it's easy for you to use it.

612
0:48:59.880 --> 0:49:04.000
So we decided to have some extensions of XWiki which are open source.

613
0:49:04.000 --> 0:49:11.120
But either you go find the source and you go and take it and build it yourself and install

614
0:49:11.120 --> 0:49:13.680
it yourself, or you use our app store.

615
0:49:13.680 --> 0:49:17.760
And in one click, you can use it, pay for it, and buy it.

616
0:49:17.760 --> 0:49:23.720
And it's been very useful for us because it allows also to explain to companies that concept.

617
0:49:23.720 --> 0:49:28.120
The fact that the important part is the fact that it's open source.

618
0:49:28.120 --> 0:49:30.320
It's not that it's free.

619
0:49:30.320 --> 0:49:32.440
That's what is important in what we do.

620
0:49:32.440 --> 0:49:38.000
But it allowed to explain that and it helped actually improve the relationship with some

621
0:49:38.000 --> 0:49:43.080
of our clients which tend naturally to say, OK, if I don't have to pay, I don't pay.

622
0:49:43.080 --> 0:49:44.320
I don't help the project.

623
0:49:44.320 --> 0:49:47.100
I don't need to pay.

624
0:49:47.100 --> 0:49:54.200
So you have to find that balance also between the commercial offers and the freedom.

625
0:49:54.200 --> 0:49:59.940
Sometimes when you build open source, you're too idealistic in a way that, OK, everything

626
0:49:59.940 --> 0:50:01.140
should be free.

627
0:50:01.140 --> 0:50:06.240
But the problem that when everything's free, you have a lot of people that don't understand

628
0:50:06.240 --> 0:50:11.200
that they actually should help the project because this project will not survive without

629
0:50:11.200 --> 0:50:12.200
funding.

630
0:50:12.200 --> 0:50:16.440
You need money to survive to make the software.

631
0:50:16.440 --> 0:50:18.880
It's necessary.

632
0:50:18.880 --> 0:50:22.600
Another aspect is that it's actually very difficult to make partnerships with service

633
0:50:22.600 --> 0:50:24.080
and cloud companies.

634
0:50:24.080 --> 0:50:30.800
Right now, Xwiki has not been able to do good partnerships with other service companies

635
0:50:30.800 --> 0:50:32.760
to distribute our software.

636
0:50:32.760 --> 0:50:33.800
It's not simple.

637
0:50:33.800 --> 0:50:40.880
And I'm not really sure how to do partnerships with cloud companies.

638
0:50:40.880 --> 0:50:46.960
Cloud companies can be very tempted to just reuse all the open source software available

639
0:50:46.960 --> 0:50:55.760
and sell it and not fund in any way the software that are in these offers.

640
0:50:55.760 --> 0:50:57.860
And we need a model for that.

641
0:50:57.860 --> 0:51:06.160
So if we want to separate the work of cloud service and of software, we need to find a

642
0:51:06.160 --> 0:51:13.600
model to how to sell open source software when it's sold to companies.

643
0:51:13.600 --> 0:51:17.000
Otherwise, the software will not be able to fund themselves.

644
0:51:17.000 --> 0:51:24.360
So Matrix, for example, has made a blog post about the fact that they have major success

645
0:51:24.360 --> 0:51:27.120
in terms of usage and deployments.

646
0:51:27.120 --> 0:51:32.720
But many of these deployments are made by other companies that are making money off

647
0:51:32.720 --> 0:51:39.640
of it and are not giving back anything, not even developers, to work on the project.

648
0:51:39.640 --> 0:51:42.120
Neither funding, neither developers.

649
0:51:42.120 --> 0:51:46.160
And in the end, they had to fire people.

650
0:51:46.160 --> 0:51:48.480
And so in order to...

651
0:51:48.480 --> 0:51:52.480
I mean, if you want to do good software, you need great people.

652
0:51:52.480 --> 0:51:53.980
You need great developers.

653
0:51:53.980 --> 0:51:59.120
And so you need to find a funding model that works.

654
0:51:59.120 --> 0:52:02.600
One aspect for open source company is to work with less cash.

655
0:52:02.600 --> 0:52:10.000
So I don't believe in VC investment because I think that doesn't allow to keep the independence

656
0:52:10.000 --> 0:52:12.680
of what we build.

657
0:52:12.680 --> 0:52:14.680
But you have to work with less cash.

658
0:52:14.680 --> 0:52:21.680
So even when you're growing, it's difficult to hire because you need a lot of cash to

659
0:52:21.680 --> 0:52:27.160
run the company itself, like to advance the money, and you are taking risks.

660
0:52:27.160 --> 0:52:30.880
And it's not a simple problem.

661
0:52:30.880 --> 0:52:33.520
Another problem is integration and fragmentation.

662
0:52:33.520 --> 0:52:36.520
So clients want things that are integrated.

663
0:52:36.520 --> 0:52:42.640
That's actually also one of the reasons you start to see packages that bundle the software.

664
0:52:42.640 --> 0:52:47.400
So trying to make them all installable together easily.

665
0:52:47.400 --> 0:52:50.000
That's actually something that's important.

666
0:52:50.000 --> 0:52:56.080
And cloud providers providing multiple software together.

667
0:52:56.080 --> 0:53:00.080
This is very interesting.

668
0:53:00.080 --> 0:53:02.880
But there is a lot of integration work that is necessary.

669
0:53:02.880 --> 0:53:08.760
And sometimes that work is not brought back to the projects.

670
0:53:08.760 --> 0:53:11.160
And we need to make that happen.

671
0:53:11.160 --> 0:53:14.400
There's also a lot of fragmentation in the EU market.

672
0:53:14.400 --> 0:53:17.160
So you need to go to multiple countries to sell.

673
0:53:17.160 --> 0:53:18.440
It takes a lot of time.

674
0:53:18.440 --> 0:53:25.280
So we need also partnerships between the companies in the different countries to work together

675
0:53:25.280 --> 0:53:29.240
in order to make that work.

676
0:53:29.240 --> 0:53:36.400
And I'm very happy to have partnerships with Univention, for example, Peter, because for

677
0:53:36.400 --> 0:53:42.600
us it's a major win of time to go on the German market.

678
0:53:42.600 --> 0:53:49.640
If a company says, look at this French company, it changes a lot the way the German market

679
0:53:49.640 --> 0:53:51.200
will see a French company.

680
0:53:51.200 --> 0:53:54.480
And that is going to be true the other way.

681
0:53:54.480 --> 0:53:57.840
So we need to work more together.

682
0:53:57.840 --> 0:54:02.440
So that's a bit the next step I have.

683
0:54:02.440 --> 0:54:04.440
So first is we need to believe in ourselves.

684
0:54:04.440 --> 0:54:06.560
So we have great offers.

685
0:54:06.560 --> 0:54:12.960
And the companies that are building open source software are able to make it.

686
0:54:12.960 --> 0:54:19.360
And the difficulty sometimes they have is about competition, is about being considered

687
0:54:19.360 --> 0:54:22.840
good enough so that a lot of companies invest in them.

688
0:54:22.840 --> 0:54:27.480
There is a huge amount of money sold on collaboration.

689
0:54:27.480 --> 0:54:33.080
I think we count billions of euros that are given to Microsoft and Google.

690
0:54:33.080 --> 0:54:39.640
And if we sum all the open source companies we were talking about, we're talking about

691
0:54:39.640 --> 0:54:46.120
$50, $100 million, something like that revenue, I don't know exactly because it's not always

692
0:54:46.120 --> 0:54:47.720
easy to get the numbers.

693
0:54:47.720 --> 0:54:54.440
But we're spending billions on collaboration software to American companies.

694
0:54:54.440 --> 0:54:57.320
So there is a lot of money.

695
0:54:57.320 --> 0:55:04.960
And just we need to convince the clients that were good enough as a group, not only as individual

696
0:55:04.960 --> 0:55:06.880
company.

697
0:55:06.880 --> 0:55:11.120
And open source provides good openness and flexibility.

698
0:55:11.120 --> 0:55:12.360
And that's useful to clients.

699
0:55:12.360 --> 0:55:18.360
So there are also good technical arguments for open source when it comes to company.

700
0:55:18.360 --> 0:55:25.680
We have had a lot of clients that were very interested in the flexibility of our software.

701
0:55:25.680 --> 0:55:31.280
But they also want easy to go solution, one provider to buy from.

702
0:55:31.280 --> 0:55:34.060
And that's a real difficulty.

703
0:55:34.060 --> 0:55:36.600
We need to work more on European collaborations.

704
0:55:36.600 --> 0:55:37.900
I talked about it.

705
0:55:37.900 --> 0:55:40.620
So at Xwiki this is something we're trying to do more.

706
0:55:40.620 --> 0:55:44.780
So the intervention partnership we did last year.

707
0:55:44.780 --> 0:55:49.440
And we're also looking at the partnerships with Nextcloud, with Open Project.

708
0:55:49.440 --> 0:55:54.240
There are multiple companies in Europe that think the same way.

709
0:55:54.240 --> 0:55:58.720
They just lack a lot of time to actually make it happen.

710
0:55:58.720 --> 0:56:01.720
And so it's going to take time.

711
0:56:01.720 --> 0:56:05.960
But there are many companies that want to do that.

712
0:56:05.960 --> 0:56:14.280
And sovereign workplace project is really great to create also this integrated offer,

713
0:56:14.280 --> 0:56:18.680
bring the providers together.

714
0:56:18.680 --> 0:56:22.280
Now we will need to find ways to do partnerships with cloud providers.

715
0:56:22.280 --> 0:56:25.360
I've yet to see how this will happen.

716
0:56:25.360 --> 0:56:26.960
And we need more open standards.

717
0:56:26.960 --> 0:56:29.800
That's also another aspect that's transversal.

718
0:56:29.800 --> 0:56:32.880
We need more open standards.

719
0:56:32.880 --> 0:56:37.000
I've also been a believer that we need an open source marketplace.

720
0:56:37.000 --> 0:56:44.080
So a way for cloud providers to sell open source software in one easy way.

721
0:56:44.080 --> 0:56:49.560
But I thought, I hope that Guy Eix would be a place for that.

722
0:56:49.560 --> 0:56:53.880
I haven't seen that happening.

723
0:56:53.880 --> 0:56:57.160
The most important thing we need is clients.

724
0:56:57.160 --> 0:57:03.840
So any clients that are brought to the companies that are providing this alternate platform

725
0:57:03.840 --> 0:57:09.160
are helping these companies bring the software a little bit better.

726
0:57:09.160 --> 0:57:10.280
And it makes a difference.

727
0:57:10.280 --> 0:57:18.980
So everything that as individuals you can do to tell your boss, employers that maybe

728
0:57:18.980 --> 0:57:24.380
they should look at what these companies are doing, that other companies are actually deploying

729
0:57:24.380 --> 0:57:27.000
these software is helping.

730
0:57:27.000 --> 0:57:32.680
So I mean, if you can help us, do it and make it known.

731
0:57:32.680 --> 0:57:33.680
And that's it.

732
0:57:33.680 --> 0:57:40.160
If there are any questions, I think there's two minutes left.

733
0:57:40.160 --> 0:57:50.880
So everybody fall asleep.

734
0:57:50.880 --> 0:57:51.880
One.

735
0:57:51.880 --> 0:57:52.880
Hi.

736
0:57:52.880 --> 0:57:58.280
You mentioned earlier in your talk that the French government deemed it illegal to host

737
0:57:58.280 --> 0:58:02.320
data on American companies because of the US Cloud Act.

738
0:58:02.320 --> 0:58:04.520
Could you expand on the Cloud Act a bit more?

739
0:58:04.520 --> 0:58:05.520
Yeah.

740
0:58:05.520 --> 0:58:18.080
The Cloud Act is the fact that the US government is able to access data from American companies

741
0:58:18.080 --> 0:58:20.680
and even from American people.

742
0:58:20.680 --> 0:58:22.320
So first, I'm not a lawyer.

743
0:58:22.320 --> 0:58:27.060
So don't take everything I say for granted.

744
0:58:27.060 --> 0:58:35.400
So it allows to access data even if that data is in a foreign country.

745
0:58:35.400 --> 0:58:41.240
So and they can even, I understood from a paper in Holland by lawyers that they could

746
0:58:41.240 --> 0:58:53.240
even ask to an American person secretly to give the data that these people can access

747
0:58:53.240 --> 0:58:54.880
and they cannot refuse basically.

748
0:58:54.880 --> 0:58:56.160
Like they risk a lot.

749
0:58:56.160 --> 0:59:02.160
So Microsoft, if asked, would secretly have to give money that they have on servers in

750
0:59:02.160 --> 0:59:08.680
Ireland and that is not compliant with GDPR.

751
0:59:08.680 --> 0:59:14.560
That's what the Mac Shremf judgments said.

752
0:59:14.560 --> 0:59:15.640
So it's been written.

753
0:59:15.640 --> 0:59:19.920
But then the problem is that it needs to be recognized and decisions need to be made to

754
0:59:19.920 --> 0:59:23.120
stop doing it.

755
0:59:23.120 --> 0:59:30.680
And it seems like everybody's waiting for Europe to sign another agreement to say that

756
0:59:30.680 --> 0:59:38.280
it's okay so that you don't have to make the decision to stop hosting it on American systems.

757
0:59:38.280 --> 0:59:39.640
Hi.

758
0:59:39.640 --> 0:59:43.760
Thanks for the presentation.

759
0:59:43.760 --> 0:59:48.360
So you were saying that actually like open source collaborative software would help solve

760
0:59:48.360 --> 0:59:54.240
the issue or improve the digital sovereignty.

761
0:59:54.240 --> 1:00:01.800
If we suppose that Microsoft tomorrow makes office source code available on GitHub, let's

762
1:00:01.800 --> 1:00:09.240
say, how would that change the actual stage of the digital sovereignty in the EU?

763
1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:14.600
Well it will change it if people start to take that software and host it and verify

764
1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.480
that it solves the business needs.

765
1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:20.760
So but yes, it would improve it.

766
1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:24.240
For example, Microsoft does not give the source code of office.

767
1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:28.600
So if you want to do office editing, you have to work with software that has been built

768
1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:30.800
by other people, not by Microsoft.

769
1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:35.280
And Microsoft and Google have better software, more compatible with office formats and so

770
1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:36.320
on and so on.

771
1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:37.360
So it would improve.

772
1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:39.520
It still would need to be packaged.

773
1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:41.300
There would still be a lot of work.

774
1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:46.680
But it would improve the offers, the alternative offers and then companies.

775
1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:53.040
But so about digital sovereignty, the thing is, if tomorrow we have a political problem,

776
1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:54.360
they can turn off the software.

777
1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:56.440
So all our companies will have problems.

778
1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:01.720
The question is, OK, do we have alternatives to replace that software at this point?

779
1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:02.940
Not necessarily as good.

780
1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:06.120
And they are not as good because we're not buying these alternatives.

781
1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.720
So we cannot fund them.

782
1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:12.840
So the distance between the American solutions and the European solution is increasing instead

783
1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:15.080
of being reduced.

784
1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.280
And so it's all about whether or not we would be able to replace that software.

785
1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:26.320
If Microsoft made it open source, it would be easier to replace their own services, their

786
1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:27.880
online services.

787
1:01:27.880 --> 1:01:28.880
Sorry.

788
1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:35.560
I want to follow up to the first question, basically.

789
1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:46.840
So US Cloud Act, regarding it, as far as I recall, Privacy Shield was the first one that

790
1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:49.520
has been taken down by your court.

791
1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:55.560
And I'm not sure if US Cloud Act somehow replaces it or not.

792
1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:56.560
No.

793
1:01:56.560 --> 1:01:59.800
No, privacy, the Cloud Act is an American law.

794
1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:05.720
The Cloud Act makes it a problem that makes Privacy Shield illegal, basically.

795
1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:10.360
Privacy Shield said it's OK to put data in the US.

796
1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:17.240
And basically, the judgment from Mike Schremms goes to his website.

797
1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:22.180
He explains the problem much more precisely, says that this is not true.

798
1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:24.840
Privacy Shield says it's OK, but it's not OK.

799
1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:32.760
Because of the Cloud Act and the FISA warrants, the laws in the US that allow access to data,

800
1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:34.280
even if it's hosted in Europe.

801
1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:39.000
Yeah, and the European Court accepted that Privacy Shield is not valid.

802
1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000
It's not valid.

803
1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000
It's not valid.

804
1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000
They accepted.

805
1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000
A couple of years, I believe, now.

806
1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.280
Now, the European government is right now negotiating, the commission is negotiating

807
1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:53.360
with Biden some new paper that says it would be OK.

808
1:02:53.360 --> 1:03:00.120
But it's already kind of validated that this paper is not OK.

809
1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:04.000
But there will need to be another judgment to say that it's not OK.

810
1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:08.200
So it's a kind of a cat and mouse, because some people in Europe don't want it to be

811
1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:10.440
illegal to use American system.

812
1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:17.840
And Biden doesn't want to change the Cloud Act.

813
1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:18.840
Thank you.

814
1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:25.320
Thank you.
