0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.920
Welcome to the first talk in the Network Dev Room, peer-to-peer browser connectivity.

2
0:00:10.920 --> 0:00:18.160
We're going to talk a bunch about WebRID-C and the new Shiny Web Transport Protocol and

3
0:00:18.160 --> 0:00:24.920
in general how to get the browser connected to a larger network.

4
0:00:24.920 --> 0:00:30.560
Before we start, very grateful to be here, thanks to all the organizers, thanks to all

5
0:00:30.560 --> 0:00:33.280
the volunteers making this event possible.

6
0:00:33.280 --> 0:00:34.280
That's wonderful.

7
0:00:34.280 --> 0:00:38.920
Yeah, and then thanks for all of you to be here and listening.

8
0:00:38.920 --> 0:00:40.960
Cool.

9
0:00:40.960 --> 0:00:43.160
Just a quick introduction about myself.

10
0:00:43.160 --> 0:00:44.160
I'm Max.

11
0:00:44.160 --> 0:00:46.480
I'm a software engineer at Protocol Labs.

12
0:00:46.480 --> 0:00:48.720
I'm starting the LIPIDP project.

13
0:00:48.720 --> 0:00:51.240
I'll do a brief introduction about LIPIDP.

14
0:00:51.240 --> 0:00:53.560
So don't worry too much about that.

15
0:00:53.560 --> 0:00:56.480
Designing the rest implementation of the library.

16
0:00:56.480 --> 0:00:59.240
In the past life, you might know me from my Prometheus time.

17
0:00:59.240 --> 0:01:02.920
I worked a bunch on Prometheus and its integration into Kubernetes.

18
0:01:02.920 --> 0:01:05.920
Still a little bit active in that community.

19
0:01:05.920 --> 0:01:10.640
You find me anywhere on the web with MX Engine and then on the website you find emails in

20
0:01:10.640 --> 0:01:13.320
case you want to get in touch.

21
0:01:13.320 --> 0:01:15.320
All right.

22
0:01:15.320 --> 0:01:17.760
So what is LIPIDP?

23
0:01:17.760 --> 0:01:19.240
Just a small disclaimer.

24
0:01:19.240 --> 0:01:24.040
The talk does mention LIPIDP from time to time.

25
0:01:24.040 --> 0:01:25.320
It is not particularly important.

26
0:01:25.320 --> 0:01:29.360
So in a sense, if you want to build your own LIPIDP application, all the content here is

27
0:01:29.360 --> 0:01:31.560
applicable for you as well.

28
0:01:31.560 --> 0:01:37.040
But if you want to have this pre-built, you can leverage LIPIDP.

29
0:01:37.040 --> 0:01:38.040
So what is LIPIDP?

30
0:01:38.040 --> 0:01:44.300
LIPIDP, as you can infer from the name, I'm guessing, is a peer-to-peer networking library.

31
0:01:44.300 --> 0:01:46.000
It has one specification.

32
0:01:46.000 --> 0:01:49.920
And then that specification is implemented in many, many different languages, like, for

33
0:01:49.920 --> 0:01:56.160
example, Go, JS, Rust, NIM, C++, Java, but a couple others as well.

34
0:01:56.160 --> 0:02:03.640
The goal of LIPIDP is provide low-level features, like encryption, authentication, hole punching,

35
0:02:03.640 --> 0:02:05.120
and things like that.

36
0:02:05.120 --> 0:02:11.560
And then on top of that, leverage those features to then also provide higher-level protocols,

37
0:02:11.560 --> 0:02:19.920
like, for example, DHT, distributed hash table, or gossiping protocols, or things like that.

38
0:02:19.920 --> 0:02:26.680
My big slogan always is, LIPIDP is all you need to build peer-to-peer applications on

39
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:28.200
the internet.

40
0:02:28.200 --> 0:02:31.240
OK, wonderful.

41
0:02:31.240 --> 0:02:38.360
One small disclaimer that's important later on is that I want to highlight here is LIPIDP

42
0:02:38.360 --> 0:02:42.720
always encrypts and always authenticates, and we'll go into that later on, what that

43
0:02:42.720 --> 0:02:43.720
means.

44
0:02:43.720 --> 0:02:45.480
But that's very important for me.

45
0:02:45.480 --> 0:02:50.680
We don't ship any traffic over the internet that is ever unencrypted or not authenticated.

46
0:02:50.680 --> 0:02:55.160
And in terms of authentication, I'm talking about mutual authentication.

47
0:02:55.160 --> 0:02:59.400
OK, that's enough introduction for today.

48
0:02:59.400 --> 0:03:03.160
And now to the actual topic.

49
0:03:03.160 --> 0:03:09.000
What I want to convey today is how we can get from here, from the left side to the right

50
0:03:09.000 --> 0:03:10.500
side.

51
0:03:10.500 --> 0:03:18.200
So my great motivation is for browsers to be first-class citizens in networked applications.

52
0:03:18.200 --> 0:03:25.080
Now on the very left side, you see the typical internet application today.

53
0:03:25.080 --> 0:03:26.680
So you have a browser.

54
0:03:26.680 --> 0:03:31.760
I'm using the Firefox logo here, but you can use any browser, really.

55
0:03:31.760 --> 0:03:37.080
That tries to interact with the networked application somewhere in the internet.

56
0:03:37.080 --> 0:03:41.920
Instead of interacting with the nodes directly, it acts through a server, and that server

57
0:03:41.920 --> 0:03:45.680
acts on behalf of the browser.

58
0:03:45.680 --> 0:03:49.400
The browser pretty much never interacts with the whole network.

59
0:03:49.400 --> 0:03:54.320
And to put this with an example, if you, for example, have a file sharing, you want to

60
0:03:54.320 --> 0:03:55.320
share a file.

61
0:03:55.320 --> 0:03:58.760
So for example, from my laptop here, I want to share a file with all of you.

62
0:03:58.760 --> 0:04:03.040
I would usually upload that to a server, and then all of you would download it from that

63
0:04:03.040 --> 0:04:04.280
server.

64
0:04:04.280 --> 0:04:07.800
We would never interact directly.

65
0:04:07.800 --> 0:04:12.360
Now there are many reasons for that to be a good architecture.

66
0:04:12.360 --> 0:04:13.880
Browsers usually move a lot.

67
0:04:13.880 --> 0:04:20.320
They might be in the living room, then in a cafe, and then at a conference in Fosdam.

68
0:04:20.320 --> 0:04:22.640
And they are usually low power.

69
0:04:22.640 --> 0:04:29.200
But what's the most heard argument for this kind of architecture in comparison to the

70
0:04:29.200 --> 0:04:34.880
right architecture is that you cannot connect to browsers, and that browsers cannot connect

71
0:04:34.880 --> 0:04:35.920
to other nodes.

72
0:04:35.920 --> 0:04:38.320
That's oftentimes heard.

73
0:04:38.320 --> 0:04:43.360
And what I want to convey here today is that you can actually nicely connect a browser

74
0:04:43.360 --> 0:04:47.920
to a whole network, and that the browser actually has a lot of connectivity options out there,

75
0:04:47.920 --> 0:04:49.800
and I want to go through these.

76
0:04:49.800 --> 0:04:55.000
And the next time you design a networked application, maybe you want to consider the architecture

77
0:04:55.000 --> 0:04:59.240
on the right, versus the architecture on the left.

78
0:04:59.240 --> 0:05:01.280
All right.

79
0:05:01.280 --> 0:05:02.280
Cool.

80
0:05:02.280 --> 0:05:07.520
When it comes to connectivity for a browser, I want to differentiate this in two dimensions.

81
0:05:07.520 --> 0:05:14.240
And the first dimension is whether my node, whatever, for example, my computer here, is

82
0:05:14.240 --> 0:05:15.400
public or private.

83
0:05:15.400 --> 0:05:20.000
So can it be reachable directly, or is it behind an at or firewall?

84
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:23.240
And or firewall.

85
0:05:23.240 --> 0:05:26.280
And public, you would usually refer to as a server.

86
0:05:26.280 --> 0:05:30.200
And then private, you would, for example, refer to my laptop or the browser running

87
0:05:30.200 --> 0:05:31.560
on my laptop.

88
0:05:31.560 --> 0:05:32.560
Cool.

89
0:05:32.560 --> 0:05:37.320
Then the other dimension, when we talk about connectivity, I want to differentiate in two

90
0:05:37.320 --> 0:05:41.160
platforms, which is browser and non-browser.

91
0:05:41.160 --> 0:05:42.160
Why is this relevant?

92
0:05:42.160 --> 0:05:44.280
Well, there are a lot more platforms, I know.

93
0:05:44.280 --> 0:05:49.160
But usually it's the non-browser, which is very unrestricted, in terms of, for example,

94
0:05:49.160 --> 0:05:52.160
I have access to UDP or TCP socket.

95
0:05:52.160 --> 0:05:56.880
And then I have the browser, which is very restricted, where sometimes I can't make a

96
0:05:56.880 --> 0:06:00.040
connection without, for example, that TLS certificate.

97
0:06:00.040 --> 0:06:01.040
Wonderful.

98
0:06:01.040 --> 0:06:02.040
Okay.

99
0:06:02.040 --> 0:06:09.080
So, and my goal today is kind of we fill this matrix now with the different options that

100
0:06:09.080 --> 0:06:10.080
we have.

101
0:06:10.080 --> 0:06:14.960
And this way I can convey the fact that actually browsers can be first class citizens in network

102
0:06:14.960 --> 0:06:15.960
applications.

103
0:06:15.960 --> 0:06:17.640
All right.

104
0:06:17.640 --> 0:06:22.600
So let's talk about public non-browser to public non-browser.

105
0:06:22.600 --> 0:06:24.040
I'm in the network dev room.

106
0:06:24.040 --> 0:06:25.040
This is the easiest one.

107
0:06:25.040 --> 0:06:28.440
I'm not going to explain this much.

108
0:06:28.440 --> 0:06:31.560
Reachability, both nodes are public.

109
0:06:31.560 --> 0:06:39.560
We can just reach out them directly over IP and TCP or then UDP and the shiny new quick.

110
0:06:39.560 --> 0:06:42.080
We don't have file walls and apps on either side.

111
0:06:42.080 --> 0:06:46.160
And the platform, which is non-browser, so, for example, an application running on my

112
0:06:46.160 --> 0:06:51.800
laptop has direct access to the TCP and UDP socket.

113
0:06:51.800 --> 0:06:53.380
Cool.

114
0:06:53.380 --> 0:06:54.840
So we have that.

115
0:06:54.840 --> 0:06:57.640
Then private non-browser to public non-browser.

116
0:06:57.640 --> 0:07:00.200
Again, really easy.

117
0:07:00.200 --> 0:07:06.680
You do this every day by any application on your laptop going to a server.

118
0:07:06.680 --> 0:07:12.080
We don't have any file walls and the server side.

119
0:07:12.080 --> 0:07:16.560
The left side is private, but we don't really care as we have the direction from the left

120
0:07:16.560 --> 0:07:17.760
to the right.

121
0:07:17.760 --> 0:07:23.200
And then the platform, again, we're not running in a browser, so we're pretty unrestricted.

122
0:07:23.200 --> 0:07:28.040
We probably have access to a TCP or UDP socket.

123
0:07:28.040 --> 0:07:30.060
Wonderful.

124
0:07:30.060 --> 0:07:36.280
To make this a little bit more complex, what if I'm a public non-browser connecting to

125
0:07:36.280 --> 0:07:37.840
a private non-browser?

126
0:07:37.840 --> 0:07:39.120
So what does that mean?

127
0:07:39.120 --> 0:07:43.080
For example, on the left, that could be a server, and then on the right, that could

128
0:07:43.080 --> 0:07:47.200
be some application running on my laptop right now.

129
0:07:47.200 --> 0:07:53.400
What we can do here is something called connection reversal, simply where my laptop connects

130
0:07:53.400 --> 0:07:55.440
to some public node.

131
0:07:55.440 --> 0:07:59.640
Then whoever wants to reach out to me reaches out to that public node as well, relays the

132
0:07:59.640 --> 0:08:05.600
message to me, my laptop, and then my laptop dials whoever wanted to dial me initially.

133
0:08:05.600 --> 0:08:06.800
This is depicted here.

134
0:08:06.800 --> 0:08:14.340
So B connects to the relay R, and then A relays a network over R to B, and then B connects

135
0:08:14.340 --> 0:08:18.760
to A, which is commonly referred to as connection reversal.

136
0:08:18.760 --> 0:08:23.440
In terms of platform, again, we're a non-browser, so access to TCP and UDP sockets, so we're

137
0:08:23.440 --> 0:08:25.280
all good.

138
0:08:25.280 --> 0:08:26.640
Cool.

139
0:08:26.640 --> 0:08:32.640
And then the last one I want to fill before it becomes complicated, namely before we introduce

140
0:08:32.640 --> 0:08:37.400
a browser, is private non-browser to private non-browser.

141
0:08:37.400 --> 0:08:42.720
You see this depicted down there as A and B. Reachability really sucks.

142
0:08:42.720 --> 0:08:47.800
Both are probably behind NATs or firewalls, so not much luck there.

143
0:08:47.800 --> 0:08:51.960
So what we need to employ here is a technique called hole punching.

144
0:08:51.960 --> 0:08:56.200
I don't have much time today in this talk, but we have another talk later on.

145
0:08:56.200 --> 0:09:02.400
So if you want to learn all about hole punching or what success rate we have across different

146
0:09:02.400 --> 0:09:06.000
protocols or IP stacks, join the talk.

147
0:09:06.000 --> 0:09:08.080
I think it's at 11.45.

148
0:09:08.080 --> 0:09:10.040
So we'll go a bunch into that.

149
0:09:10.040 --> 0:09:12.680
Just short, brief one.

150
0:09:12.680 --> 0:09:14.000
A and B want to connect.

151
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:15.620
Both are behind firewalls.

152
0:09:15.620 --> 0:09:19.340
Both connect to a relay R. That R is public.

153
0:09:19.340 --> 0:09:25.920
They coordinate a hole punch over that relay and then execute that hole punch through both

154
0:09:25.920 --> 0:09:26.920
of their firewalls.

155
0:09:26.920 --> 0:09:27.920
Cool.

156
0:09:27.920 --> 0:09:31.600
In terms of platforms, again, we're not on the browser yet.

157
0:09:31.600 --> 0:09:34.120
So we have access to a TCP and UDP socket.

158
0:09:34.120 --> 0:09:35.120
All good.

159
0:09:35.120 --> 0:09:36.120
Life is pretty easy.

160
0:09:36.120 --> 0:09:37.120
Wonderful.

161
0:09:37.120 --> 0:09:39.160
All right.

162
0:09:39.160 --> 0:09:44.920
Now comes complexity, which is the browser world.

163
0:09:44.920 --> 0:09:51.400
And what I want to talk about first is what if I'm a private browser?

164
0:09:51.400 --> 0:09:54.480
Now private browser is somewhat of a weird term.

165
0:09:54.480 --> 0:09:59.080
Usually you're not at FOSTEM and you don't have a public IPv4 or IPv6 address.

166
0:09:59.080 --> 0:10:06.760
So browsers are usually always private, which I'm not suggesting to change.

167
0:10:06.760 --> 0:10:07.760
Definitely not.

168
0:10:07.760 --> 0:10:11.760
There are many security considerations to keep it that way.

169
0:10:11.760 --> 0:10:16.400
But what if I want to connect from a private browser to a public non-browser?

170
0:10:16.400 --> 0:10:22.920
So what if I, for example, want to connect from my laptop within my browser to some server?

171
0:10:22.920 --> 0:10:28.280
Now this, again, sounds pretty easy to everyone, except one small disclaimer.

172
0:10:28.280 --> 0:10:33.240
Again, we don't have a firewall or NAT at the receiver side.

173
0:10:33.240 --> 0:10:37.560
A server is public, depending on the firewall rules obviously.

174
0:10:37.560 --> 0:10:40.200
But we can easily reach out to them.

175
0:10:40.200 --> 0:10:45.280
In terms of platform, we are on the browser, so we're quite restricted in the sense of

176
0:10:45.280 --> 0:10:47.840
what we can do.

177
0:10:47.840 --> 0:10:50.640
Eventually I want to end up with a byte stream between the two endpoints.

178
0:10:50.640 --> 0:10:54.160
So what I'm restricted to is either WebSockets.

179
0:10:54.160 --> 0:10:55.160
Everyone knows that.

180
0:10:55.160 --> 0:11:00.720
So TCP, TLS, HTTP, then an upgrade, and then I have WebSocket.

181
0:11:00.720 --> 0:11:03.640
The problem with that is I need a valid TLS certificate.

182
0:11:03.640 --> 0:11:12.040
So I need the remote server to either have a signed IP certificate or based on a domain.

183
0:11:12.040 --> 0:11:13.400
So that's a bummer.

184
0:11:13.400 --> 0:11:18.080
What I can do as an alternative in the browser is use the shiny new WebTransport, which is

185
0:11:18.080 --> 0:11:24.640
basically, I'm simplifying a lot here, but basically WebSockets on top of Flick or HTTP3.

186
0:11:24.640 --> 0:11:31.040
WebTransport actually allows us to handle self-signed certificates.

187
0:11:31.040 --> 0:11:35.640
And then as an alternative, we can use WebRTC to get a byte stream.

188
0:11:35.640 --> 0:11:43.480
WebRTC gives us data channels, so in the end we can run on IP, UDP, then SCTP, and then

189
0:11:43.480 --> 0:11:45.720
use data channels from WebRTC.

190
0:11:45.720 --> 0:11:51.360
Now before you scream, this is insecure, the smallest gamer that I did at the beginning

191
0:11:51.360 --> 0:11:56.080
is in case you built this to yourself, you still need to figure out proper authentication,

192
0:11:56.080 --> 0:11:57.080
right?

193
0:11:57.080 --> 0:12:01.360
Best would be mutual authentication because self-signed certificates, you're not part

194
0:12:01.360 --> 0:12:05.600
of the authority trust chain.

195
0:12:05.600 --> 0:12:08.120
But otherwise, yeah, these are your options.

196
0:12:08.120 --> 0:12:12.480
So WebSocket, WebTransport, and WebRTC.

197
0:12:12.480 --> 0:12:14.560
Cool.

198
0:12:14.560 --> 0:12:23.000
So what if I want to connect from a public non-browser to a private browser?

199
0:12:23.000 --> 0:12:26.320
We had this in the past, a couple slides back.

200
0:12:26.320 --> 0:12:32.400
In terms of reachability, my left side is reachable, my right side is not reachable,

201
0:12:32.400 --> 0:12:36.880
so what I can do, I don't need to do fancy hole punching, I can just do connection reversal

202
0:12:36.880 --> 0:12:43.720
right over the relay where A asks B basically to dial it back over the relay.

203
0:12:43.720 --> 0:12:48.640
In terms of platform, we don't have direct access to the TCP or UDP socket, given that

204
0:12:48.640 --> 0:12:53.400
on the right side we have a browser in the whole stack, so that's a bummer.

205
0:12:53.400 --> 0:12:58.840
We can do WebSockets in case we have a valid TLS certificate signed by some authority.

206
0:12:58.840 --> 0:13:03.400
If not, we can do WebTransport and WebRTC.

207
0:13:03.400 --> 0:13:05.920
Cool.

208
0:13:05.920 --> 0:13:11.080
And now comes the very hard part, or not very hard part, but a little bit more difficult

209
0:13:11.080 --> 0:13:18.880
part, which is private browser to private browser, or what is basically the same is

210
0:13:18.880 --> 0:13:25.440
was it private non-browser to private browser, or private browser to private non-browser?

211
0:13:25.440 --> 0:13:29.120
All the red boxes down there.

212
0:13:29.120 --> 0:13:35.200
In terms of reachability, we need to leverage hole punching at this point.

213
0:13:35.200 --> 0:13:38.880
Both endpoints are behind the firewall and are not.

214
0:13:38.880 --> 0:13:42.880
So again, we'll go more into details on how hole punching works.

215
0:13:42.880 --> 0:13:46.160
Probably a lot of you are already familiar with that.

216
0:13:46.160 --> 0:13:52.740
In terms of platforms, at least one of our two sides are behind our browsers.

217
0:13:52.740 --> 0:13:57.560
So that means we don't have access to TCP or UDP socket directly.

218
0:13:57.560 --> 0:14:01.360
Why am I always saying no access to TCP and UDP?

219
0:14:01.360 --> 0:14:07.000
That's relevant because you don't control the ports, and this way you don't have the

220
0:14:07.000 --> 0:14:09.600
capability of hole punching yourself.

221
0:14:09.600 --> 0:14:12.160
But what the browser gives us is WebRTC.

222
0:14:12.160 --> 0:14:18.960
WebRTC has hole punching built in, so what we can do is leverage WebRTC and some signaling

223
0:14:18.960 --> 0:14:24.600
server R in the middle to then do the actual hole punch.

224
0:14:24.600 --> 0:14:28.680
Web sockets doesn't work because we can't hole punch with WebSockets, and WebTransport

225
0:14:28.680 --> 0:14:33.400
doesn't work either because we can't hole punch with WebTransport either.

226
0:14:33.400 --> 0:14:34.880
Okay.

227
0:14:34.880 --> 0:14:35.960
Wonderful.

228
0:14:35.960 --> 0:14:42.680
And that concludes the whole matrix, and what I'm pretty much showing here is you can connect

229
0:14:42.680 --> 0:14:48.760
a browser to everyone out there that runs on IP, and that means your application can

230
0:14:48.760 --> 0:14:53.160
actually make the browser a first-class citizen within your network.

231
0:14:53.160 --> 0:14:54.760
Cool.

232
0:14:54.760 --> 0:14:56.800
That's all from my end.

233
0:14:56.800 --> 0:14:58.280
Yeah.

234
0:14:58.280 --> 0:15:02.400
I'll be around the venue for quite a bit.

235
0:15:02.400 --> 0:15:07.680
If you want to learn more about Lippy2P in general, which makes all this nicely packaged

236
0:15:07.680 --> 0:15:11.200
for you, you can visit docs.lippy2p.io.

237
0:15:11.200 --> 0:15:15.640
If you want to see all the nitty gritty details about the different transports and what that

238
0:15:15.640 --> 0:15:20.920
means for, I don't know, for example, your signed TLS certificate or where you can hole

239
0:15:20.920 --> 0:15:24.760
punch, that would be on connectivity.lippy2p.io.

240
0:15:24.760 --> 0:15:26.160
There are various forums.

241
0:15:26.160 --> 0:15:31.040
There's a specification online, and then, yeah, all the implementations are open source,

242
0:15:31.040 --> 0:15:35.480
so you can just check that out on github.com slash lippy2p.

243
0:15:35.480 --> 0:15:36.480
Cool.

244
0:15:36.480 --> 0:15:37.480
That's all from my end.

245
0:15:37.480 --> 0:15:38.480
Thank you very much.

246
0:15:38.480 --> 0:16:01.880
Okay, I'm going to tell you about this place called Lippy2P.
