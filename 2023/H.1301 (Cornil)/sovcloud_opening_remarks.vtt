00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
So, hello and welcome to FOSDEM 2023 and I hope everyone is awake and looking forward

00:18.240 --> 00:23.600
to two days packed with lots of talks, at least I am.

00:23.600 --> 00:33.440
And we, that's Kristi, Torsten and me, we are the organizers or deaf room managers for

00:33.440 --> 00:34.440
this room.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.760
So, if you have any questions, you can approach us.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.320
We are here to guide through the day.

00:41.320 --> 00:47.720
And we are also the ones who submitted the idea of the sovereign cloud deaf room to the

00:47.720 --> 00:48.960
FOSDEM.

00:48.960 --> 00:55.720
And we did that because, well, with our day work, we actually work in that space.

00:55.720 --> 01:01.280
So, Torsten is from the operate first project by Red Hat.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.640
I work on the sovereign cloud stack, which is also a project that is centered with a

01:06.640 --> 01:12.040
focus on sovereign cloud infrastructure and standards.

01:12.040 --> 01:17.880
And of course, as we work with it on a day-to-day base, we think it's an important topic.

01:17.880 --> 01:29.600
And also, the term, digital sovereignty is often a term that is used a lot lately and

01:29.600 --> 01:33.920
it actually needs proper definition and it also, there needs to be a discussion about

01:33.920 --> 01:40.760
it, what it actually means and what is needed in order to work towards sovereign infrastructure.

01:40.760 --> 01:47.000
And that, if you looked at the talks that are happening today in this room, that will

01:47.000 --> 01:49.440
be what will be discussed a lot.

01:49.440 --> 01:55.440
And yeah, I'm not, I don't really have much more to add to that.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.800
Torsten, do you want to?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Okay, yeah.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.080
So, I'm working with Red Hat and I'm in the project operate first, which is the idea of

02:04.080 --> 02:07.000
open operations.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.840
You can see the stickers here and if you want to pick them up.

02:09.840 --> 02:17.640
The idea there is that we offer more or less free service, I mean free service by where

02:17.640 --> 02:24.120
you can open up your own Kubernetes clusters, you can deploy your project there and you

02:24.120 --> 02:30.560
have also a kind of open SRE there because you can see the different infrastructure data.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.840
And so that's the basic idea of open operations.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.840
And with open operations, you get the chance to be sovereign with your data because it's

02:38.840 --> 02:42.920
easy to move, it's easy to see, and we are totally hybrid so it doesn't matter if it's

02:42.920 --> 02:46.600
on your own premise or in whatever cloud or you're switching in between.

02:46.600 --> 02:52.200
So, operate first is kind of the idea, one of the proof of concept that the idea of sovereign

02:52.200 --> 02:56.040
cloud can work in a practical idea.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.840
Hi, I'm Krista Nicola.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.720
I'm a software engineer with Boston University.

03:02.720 --> 03:09.360
I work on the MOC Alliance project out of Boston University whose goal is to create

03:09.360 --> 03:12.280
an open cloud for academia but not only.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.840
I also work on OpenStack.

03:13.840 --> 03:19.160
I am on the OpenStack technical committee and I am a maintainer of the OpenStack Keystone

03:19.160 --> 03:22.840
project which is for identity management.

03:22.840 --> 03:29.920
I also work on varying degrees on operate first with Thorsten on open infra labs and

03:29.920 --> 03:37.000
on various acronym rich things like NERC, NSE, et cetera.

03:37.000 --> 03:46.320
And working on OpenSource and having worked on deploying and maintaining open clouds,

03:46.320 --> 03:51.720
the topic of sovereign clouds is very important to me and I see it as the next step in not

03:51.720 --> 03:56.320
just opening up the telemetry and how you're deploying it and how you're running it but

03:56.320 --> 04:02.740
also opening up the governance and all of those other aspects to actually create a place

04:02.740 --> 04:08.800
where everyone can contribute to on all aspects of the cloud and not just take what you're

04:08.800 --> 04:15.320
doing and apply it to a different degree.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.720
So with that, Thorsten already had a first highlight for me because I did not know that

04:19.720 --> 04:21.680
you are the PTL for Keystone.

04:21.680 --> 04:28.040
So that's really useful for me to know because we just submitted patches to Keystone for

04:28.040 --> 04:34.600
federated authentication and so we should really talk a lot more.

04:34.600 --> 04:41.920
So with that, the first one who will talk will be my colleague Max and he will prepare

04:41.920 --> 04:47.520
and then we will give a proper introduction to Max and start with that in 10 minutes,

04:47.520 --> 04:48.520
right?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.400
Yeah, 10 minutes, right.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
Okay.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.840
So feel free, here's some candy, some chocolate if you want to.

04:54.840 --> 05:23.800
There are stickers there and yeah, enjoy the day, right?
