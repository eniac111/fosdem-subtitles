0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.280
Hi, welcome to my talk. So you want to build a deterministic networking system, a gentle

2
0:00:12.280 --> 0:00:17.720
introduction to time-sensitive networking, just out of interest how many of you have

3
0:00:17.720 --> 0:00:23.720
heard of TSN or time-sensitive networking so far? That's quite a few for a networking

4
0:00:23.720 --> 0:00:30.720
session, that's great. How many of you have already worked with that? Not so many. Okay,

5
0:00:30.720 --> 0:00:38.200
you will after that talk. Yeah, who am I? I think I'm a former system engineer. I worked

6
0:00:38.200 --> 0:00:44.680
a lot with time-sensitive networking and its predecessors. I also took part in standardization,

7
0:00:44.680 --> 0:00:50.160
so I also did some of that. And since last summer, I work at the current developer at

8
0:00:50.160 --> 0:00:58.320
Pangrotronics, that's a German Linux consulting and support company. We have roughly 7,600

9
0:00:58.320 --> 0:01:04.360
patches in the kernel and we also do consulting for real-time networking amongst many other

10
0:01:04.360 --> 0:01:11.760
stuff. And by the way, we're hiring, of course. Now, to what we will look into today, we will

11
0:01:11.760 --> 0:01:19.640
look into applications. I will give you some examples why you would probably want to do

12
0:01:19.640 --> 0:01:27.720
networking over real-time data transport over networking and what the implications of that

13
0:01:27.720 --> 0:01:33.120
is, what the requirements of these applications are. We will look into the basic building

14
0:01:33.120 --> 0:01:39.360
blocks. So, sorry for the folks who already know about that. And we will talk a bit about

15
0:01:39.360 --> 0:01:46.200
which Linux user space and kernel components are used in building these applications. And

16
0:01:46.200 --> 0:01:52.160
I will sum up the state of the union a bit and then just as an announcement in advance,

17
0:01:52.160 --> 0:01:57.360
there are some bonus slides where I will give some more details and some references to open

18
0:01:57.360 --> 0:02:02.680
source projects already working with TSM. So, if you're interested in that, just download

19
0:02:02.680 --> 0:02:08.600
the slides from the Penta and, well, check out the links. And I also gave an example

20
0:02:08.600 --> 0:02:14.600
of how to basically glue together a stage box, so a transport system for audio data

21
0:02:14.600 --> 0:02:21.360
over the network. I won't make that into the talk because it has been shortened to half

22
0:02:21.360 --> 0:02:29.320
an hour. So, the example I will focus on today is audio video bridging. So, if you want to

23
0:02:29.320 --> 0:02:35.800
transport real-time data over a network for an application just as this talk, you want

24
0:02:35.800 --> 0:02:41.320
to have as low JIT above or as much JIT above as possible to reduce latency in the system

25
0:02:41.320 --> 0:02:47.160
because if you transport data over a traditional network, packets could get dropped, so you

26
0:02:47.160 --> 0:02:53.720
have to resend them or you have to make sure that somehow magically interfering traffic

27
0:02:53.720 --> 0:03:00.280
doesn't do you any harm. And that usually involves quite large JIT above us of up to

28
0:03:00.280 --> 0:03:05.720
several seconds. And if I talk now and you hear me from stage and you hear me from the

29
0:03:05.720 --> 0:03:11.640
EPA four seconds after that, that would be quite annoying. So, you want to cut that down

30
0:03:11.640 --> 0:03:19.800
to as low as possible transmission latency overall, end-to-end latency. Of course, for

31
0:03:19.800 --> 0:03:27.880
TSN, we started as audio video bridging or A-V-B as a standard. They came across the

32
0:03:27.880 --> 0:03:33.680
fact that this technology could also be useful for quite some other applications. Most of

33
0:03:33.680 --> 0:03:38.720
the customers do like machine control stuff with that. So, if you have a large production

34
0:03:38.720 --> 0:03:45.320
line and you want to transmit data between your PLC and your server drives or your robot

35
0:03:45.320 --> 0:03:53.880
arms and stuff, you also want to make sure that your control data arrives in time at

36
0:03:53.880 --> 0:04:00.880
the actor or your sensor data is read in within a certain point in time. And that's quite

37
0:04:00.880 --> 0:04:06.640
important to keep that timing. Same holds, of course, for aerospace and automotive and

38
0:04:06.640 --> 0:04:12.760
railways and stuff. I won't go into these applications today because we're, as I said,

39
0:04:12.760 --> 0:04:19.080
short on time. The first requirement of said applications is that you need to establish

40
0:04:19.080 --> 0:04:24.800
a common time base in the network. That's due to the fact that while measuring time

41
0:04:24.800 --> 0:04:30.840
in computers is basically hooking up a hardware counter to a crystal oscillator. These crash

42
0:04:30.840 --> 0:04:37.200
crystal oscillators tend to have frequency drift over time, especially with temperature.

43
0:04:37.200 --> 0:04:42.440
And due to the different switch on points in time, you also have quite large offsets.

44
0:04:42.440 --> 0:04:50.400
So if you start one device, say at 12 o'clock and the other at 1 p.m., they have one hour

45
0:04:50.400 --> 0:04:58.960
of offset in there. So you want to make sure that all your network devices have a common

46
0:04:58.960 --> 0:05:09.520
meaning or a sense of time passing and a common sense of what time it is because lots of scheduling

47
0:05:09.520 --> 0:05:14.640
decisions for networking traffic may depend on timing. Also, for some applications, as

48
0:05:14.640 --> 0:05:20.640
the audio example, you also would like to regenerate your audio sampling clocks. So

49
0:05:20.640 --> 0:05:26.520
basically in order not to introduce any additional degradation in audio quality, you want to

50
0:05:26.520 --> 0:05:34.240
make sure that your sampling clocks of your ADC and DAC run basically in lockstep. And

51
0:05:34.240 --> 0:05:39.600
that is why you want to make sure that your time is distributed evenly. And the way this

52
0:05:39.600 --> 0:05:46.680
is done usually in networks is just shown basically in this old style picture. You elect

53
0:05:46.680 --> 0:05:52.520
a so-called master clock. So basically that's the best clock reference in your network or

54
0:05:52.520 --> 0:05:59.160
the most stable clock reference in your network. And then basically you compare all other clocks

55
0:05:59.160 --> 0:06:05.920
to that clock reference and they have to adjust their local time for that reference time.

56
0:06:05.920 --> 0:06:11.880
It's basically just as those three gentlemen do in that picture. I like that comparison

57
0:06:11.880 --> 0:06:18.000
because you find a lot of analogies and the standards to just the way that works with

58
0:06:18.000 --> 0:06:28.880
like pocket watches. And if you look into that, you will find that basic idea quite

59
0:06:28.880 --> 0:06:36.440
useful to keep in mind. Now, the other thing we want to have guaranteed is, as I already

60
0:06:36.440 --> 0:06:42.800
said, bound transmission latency. So if we go across the transmission of a data stream

61
0:06:42.800 --> 0:06:48.520
in the network, so that's what the standard calls a talker at the left. And that's what

62
0:06:48.520 --> 0:06:54.480
the standard calls bridges. Usually as we're dealing with layer two, that's ethernet switches.

63
0:06:54.480 --> 0:06:59.440
And in the right, that's what the standard calls a listener. You also call it a source

64
0:06:59.440 --> 0:07:07.600
and a sink. But the standard talks about talkers and listeners. And the packet goes from bridge

65
0:07:07.600 --> 0:07:15.280
to bridge along its path across the network. And each switch, basically a bridge, has an

66
0:07:15.280 --> 0:07:21.160
ingress queue and a switch fabric and an egress queue. That's due to the fact that you can

67
0:07:21.160 --> 0:07:27.680
only transmit one packet out of a certain network port at a time. You can't just, if

68
0:07:27.680 --> 0:07:32.880
another packet at another port arrives for that destination port, you have to store it.

69
0:07:32.880 --> 0:07:37.400
And you have to wait until last transmission is done. And then you can transmit the next

70
0:07:37.400 --> 0:07:43.200
packet. And this introduces what's called a residence time in each switch. So even if

71
0:07:43.200 --> 0:07:50.120
you have a perfect pass through through network without any additional interfering traffic,

72
0:07:50.120 --> 0:07:54.840
you add a little time. At each step, your payload packet travels through the network.

73
0:07:54.840 --> 0:08:00.120
So if our audio starts here, it's a bit later when it arrives here and a bit later when

74
0:08:00.120 --> 0:08:06.680
it arrives there, and so on and so forth. So that's fine, as long as you have no interfering

75
0:08:06.680 --> 0:08:12.760
traffic. Because if you have additional interfering traffic, and that might be because we of course

76
0:08:12.760 --> 0:08:17.800
want to use our audio on converged networks. So we want to use the same network for, say,

77
0:08:17.800 --> 0:08:25.200
our live PA system and for our network internet connection. And we want to download a large

78
0:08:25.200 --> 0:08:33.680
file because we want to download a presentation recording from Fostem. And basically that's

79
0:08:33.680 --> 0:08:41.920
where this entity arrives and it's introduced or it creates a large amount of traffic here.

80
0:08:41.920 --> 0:08:47.720
This will cause the packet here to be delayed until it's sent out of the egress port. And

81
0:08:47.720 --> 0:08:54.160
basically it won't arrive in time. And if we go for as small Jitter buffers as possible,

82
0:08:54.160 --> 0:08:59.880
that's a problem because we have a buffer underrun at the listener side. And basically

83
0:08:59.880 --> 0:09:05.280
we have audio dropouts in the audio case or we have stolen motors in the industrial control

84
0:09:05.280 --> 0:09:11.360
case. And that's something we have to avoid under any circumstances. So basically something

85
0:09:11.360 --> 0:09:18.880
we want to have is quality of service. And so the picture, of course, you're a professional

86
0:09:18.880 --> 0:09:22.800
networking engineer, so you don't need that picture. But the picture I like to use for

87
0:09:22.800 --> 0:09:29.120
that is a bus lane in the street because also the bus runs in a more or less isochromous

88
0:09:29.120 --> 0:09:39.680
way. So you send those bus or packets down the lane and the way not to be hindered by

89
0:09:39.680 --> 0:09:46.440
the interfering traffic there is just basically to introduce a priority lane. And that is

90
0:09:46.440 --> 0:09:54.080
what we also use in networks basically when we introduce quality of service measures.

91
0:09:54.080 --> 0:09:59.560
Another thing we need for at least some of these applications is link layer redundancy.

92
0:09:59.560 --> 0:10:06.200
So imagine if there's a mixing desk right in the back and we run a network link back

93
0:10:06.200 --> 0:10:12.480
there and someone just trips over that link, rips out the cable or maybe it's a fiber link

94
0:10:12.480 --> 0:10:18.200
and someone stomps on the fiber link. Bad things happen and basically if host M is over,

95
0:10:18.200 --> 0:10:25.480
we don't want to have that. So we want to introduce means of having redundancy schemes

96
0:10:25.480 --> 0:10:32.480
there. Basically you can't think of it as a real time capable, real time healing with

97
0:10:32.480 --> 0:10:41.920
no waiting time like spanning tree-ish thing. You want to have the standard spanning trees

98
0:10:41.920 --> 0:10:48.840
quite don't cut it for these kinds of applications so we have to introduce other stuff there.

99
0:10:48.840 --> 0:10:52.880
We have some other application requirements there. They're not so important so I leave

100
0:10:52.880 --> 0:11:01.640
them out for now. Now what does the or what kernel and user space components do we have

101
0:11:01.640 --> 0:11:09.560
to implement that? We will look into what the TSM components are later or what the TSM

102
0:11:09.560 --> 0:11:15.240
components are because that's basically just numbers and letters. So for time synchronization,

103
0:11:15.240 --> 0:11:21.920
for especially TSM we use GPTP. That's a flavor of the precision time protocol, basically

104
0:11:21.920 --> 0:11:30.120
generalized precision time protocol of which you can think of PTP, standard PTP, IEEE 1588

105
0:11:30.120 --> 0:11:36.540
boils down to layer two. So of course we're dealing with raw, ethernet frames so we can't

106
0:11:36.540 --> 0:11:42.640
use UDP for transport and it also has some other quirks but they're not too important

107
0:11:42.640 --> 0:11:48.160
right there. And the way we do that with Linux kernel we have the hardware time-simping units

108
0:11:48.160 --> 0:11:55.040
and the PTP hardware clocks. That's basically the interface to hardware clocks in your ethernet

109
0:11:55.040 --> 0:12:03.080
MAC or PHY and the user space component to run all the remaining stuff is PTP for Linux.

110
0:12:03.080 --> 0:12:07.240
That's basically the way it works and it works quite well. You can achieve down to several

111
0:12:07.240 --> 0:12:13.080
nanoseconds precision from point to point with that. For traffic shaping that's the

112
0:12:13.080 --> 0:12:21.160
quality of service measure we want to employ. The kernel has the TC subsystem and usually

113
0:12:21.160 --> 0:12:30.620
if you configure that manually you use IP

114
0:12:30.620 --> 0:12:38.520
where it works and we will look into a bit of detail later for network management. So

115
0:12:38.520 --> 0:12:44.640
basically if you have to reserve a data flow from a talker to a listener that's where it

116
0:12:44.640 --> 0:12:50.080
gets a bit sketchy because that's of course user space demons and there aren't much. There's

117
0:12:50.080 --> 0:12:57.000
also a problem because there's several ways of doing that. The traditional way of or ABB

118
0:12:57.000 --> 0:13:04.800
style, the initial implementation used the so-called stream reservation protocol. Modern

119
0:13:04.800 --> 0:13:15.120
ways for especially pre-calculated or pre-engineered networks is using Yang-Nadcon extensions.

120
0:13:15.120 --> 0:13:21.800
And there are some demons for that but support for the TSN extensions is not too great. So

121
0:13:21.800 --> 0:13:32.240
if you're into that that's quite a nice thing to work on. For the real-time data packetization

122
0:13:32.240 --> 0:13:39.360
that's mostly user space. Of course you want to use some kernel features like ETF, Qdisks

123
0:13:39.360 --> 0:13:47.560
and XDP to have as low overhead as possible and to make sure that your transmission is

124
0:13:47.560 --> 0:13:54.200
sent out as asynchronously as possible and you want to use offloading for that. And then

125
0:13:54.200 --> 0:14:02.080
there's some very application specific user space components. So for audio video stuff

126
0:14:02.080 --> 0:14:08.280
you can use the G-streamer plugins and for industrial control I'd recommend to use the

127
0:14:08.280 --> 0:14:18.760
Open6651 implementation that's not quite finished yet but it's a good starting point at least.

128
0:14:18.760 --> 0:14:26.480
And for the link layer redundancy that's what PCR and FRAER is. Basically the standards

129
0:14:26.480 --> 0:14:33.560
are finished since one or two years. There's not much hardware supporting that yet and

130
0:14:33.560 --> 0:14:39.440
you really want to have hardware offloading for that so you're basically down to proprietary

131
0:14:39.440 --> 0:14:46.720
vendor stacks at the moment. There are efforts to put stuff mainline but they are not quite

132
0:14:46.720 --> 0:14:55.640
there yet. But stuff is coming and that's the good thing with that. So I think one slide

133
0:14:55.640 --> 0:15:05.200
is missing there which is not a too big problem. Yes, one slide is missing. So basically the

134
0:15:05.200 --> 0:15:12.840
stuff how to put stuff together with TSN I will summarize it without a slide. With time

135
0:15:12.840 --> 0:15:23.520
synchronization we have GPTP that's IEEE 802.1AS for the IEEE standard fetishists here in

136
0:15:23.520 --> 0:15:30.640
the room. Traffic shaping the basic standard stuff is the credit based shaper but there

137
0:15:30.640 --> 0:15:37.680
are more time aware shapers available right now. They are basically making more efficient

138
0:15:37.680 --> 0:15:44.480
use of your network and the way that works is basically reserving bandwidth along your

139
0:15:44.480 --> 0:15:56.480
data flow path in your network. Network management again that's a bit application specific so

140
0:15:56.480 --> 0:16:02.400
the audio video and professional audio video stuff is still using the stream reservation

141
0:16:02.400 --> 0:16:12.600
protocols and for the payload as I already told that's really really application specific.

142
0:16:12.600 --> 0:16:19.080
For redundancy we use PCR and FRER. Usually there are some exceptions to that especially

143
0:16:19.080 --> 0:16:24.960
for professional audio video PCR and FRER weren't standardized when those standards

144
0:16:24.960 --> 0:16:31.120
were written so there are some proprietary or not proprietary but some other redundancy

145
0:16:31.120 --> 0:16:38.800
schemes where you basically send two different streams and try to separate your networks

146
0:16:38.800 --> 0:16:49.520
by means of VLANs usually and try to force different data paths through network. Basically

147
0:16:49.520 --> 0:16:55.880
nowadays you want to go PCR and FRER whenever your hardware support starts. So state of

148
0:16:55.880 --> 0:17:02.600
the union the hard stuff is already done so there's already implementations in the kernel

149
0:17:02.600 --> 0:17:10.960
there are user space demons available. That's again the stuff that's difficult to get right

150
0:17:10.960 --> 0:17:16.280
so if you want to implement those standards first of all you have to read like tons of

151
0:17:16.280 --> 0:17:25.720
paper I did that for an employer took me two years so that's really hard to get right and

152
0:17:25.720 --> 0:17:30.080
the good thing is that that is already implemented you just have to use it and you have to use

153
0:17:30.080 --> 0:17:39.080
the right knobs. For some stuff like GPTP and traffic shaping you want to really really

154
0:17:39.080 --> 0:17:46.840
use for GPTP you have to use for traffic shaping you want to use hardware offloading. You

155
0:17:46.840 --> 0:17:53.480
have to bear in mind that your network gear has to support explicitly GPTP and traffic

156
0:17:53.480 --> 0:17:59.960
shaping so the band with reservation and basically making sure that your traffic shaping is

157
0:17:59.960 --> 0:18:10.960
applied properly. That's not true for every hardware especially not for commodity hardware

158
0:18:10.960 --> 0:18:16.720
and bear in mind that sometimes configuration especially for traffic shaping can be quite

159
0:18:16.720 --> 0:18:23.000
tricky. As I said I have added bonus slides to the presentation I will check that they

160
0:18:23.000 --> 0:18:32.520
have the right slides in there later on or just contact me and the point is especially

161
0:18:32.520 --> 0:18:37.200
credit based shapers can be really really tricky to set up properly and to make sure

162
0:18:37.200 --> 0:18:43.680
that you reserve the bandwidth you want because you want to have the remaining bandwidth to

163
0:18:43.680 --> 0:18:49.720
be available for best effort traffic so the idea is that you can use like say 70% of your

164
0:18:49.720 --> 0:18:54.920
link for your audio video stuff and still have like 30% of your gigabit link which is

165
0:18:54.920 --> 0:19:02.320
what we are usually dealing with for like audio video available for just best effort

166
0:19:02.320 --> 0:19:07.640
network management traffic and whatsoever so you really want to make sure your shapers

167
0:19:07.640 --> 0:19:14.520
are configured the right way to you and it's quite hard to tweak the right knobs in IP

168
0:19:14.520 --> 0:19:23.360
2. So there are good examples and I strongly recommend to read the docs on that there's

169
0:19:23.360 --> 0:19:29.280
also a link to the TSM read the docs for Linux it's quite a good starting point for getting

170
0:19:29.280 --> 0:19:36.040
into that whole topic and yeah basically I think that's it do you have any questions?

171
0:19:36.040 --> 0:19:46.840
Any questions here?

172
0:19:46.840 --> 0:19:49.200
Questions?

173
0:19:49.200 --> 0:19:55.240
Hey thanks for this what's the highest speed Ethernet implementation of this you've seen

174
0:19:55.240 --> 0:20:01.280
like have you gone seen anything beyond like 10 gigi for example or?

175
0:20:01.280 --> 0:20:09.360
I have seen a 10 gig implementation for that as far as I recall the standards and have

176
0:20:09.360 --> 0:20:16.200
some limitations with respect to how you communicate your bandwidth requirements and they're a

177
0:20:16.200 --> 0:20:24.880
bit capped I'm sure and I know that they are working on that for future revisions of the

178
0:20:24.880 --> 0:20:31.640
sun it's because of course now faster links are becoming available more and more most

179
0:20:31.640 --> 0:20:39.240
applications for TSM like the control stuff or the AV stuff are running on 100 megabit

180
0:20:39.240 --> 0:20:46.480
links still you want to go to gigabit links because you can achieve quite a bit lower

181
0:20:46.480 --> 0:20:55.840
end to end latencies on faster links but I haven't seen personally haven't seen faster

182
0:20:55.840 --> 0:21:01.800
stuff than 10 gig so far but I'd be interested to do so.

183
0:21:01.800 --> 0:21:09.200
Do you have happy stories or really users that have put this in production and can you

184
0:21:09.200 --> 0:21:10.520
tell more about this?

185
0:21:10.520 --> 0:21:19.160
Yeah so if you want to check that out you can just google for Milan and TSM which is

186
0:21:19.160 --> 0:21:24.960
the professional audio video stuff and they just before covid started shortly before covid

187
0:21:24.960 --> 0:21:32.120
started they ran the Bumstein concert concert in Munich over a TSM system it's a really

188
0:21:32.120 --> 0:21:38.480
large system with several video balls and several like hundreds of thousands of audio

189
0:21:38.480 --> 0:21:44.720
streams and pyrotechniques and light control and stuff all in the same network converged

190
0:21:44.720 --> 0:21:52.120
so that's the largest installation for live audio I know of and I think that's quite a

191
0:21:52.120 --> 0:21:56.320
good story to tell.

192
0:21:56.320 --> 0:22:02.440
I was curious if you had the chance to play around with synchronous Ethernet as well?

193
0:22:02.440 --> 0:22:18.320
I haven't looked into that too deep yet so I can't tell you too much about that.

194
0:22:18.320 --> 0:22:25.280
You mentioned XDP are you aware of any applications of XDP in that area?

195
0:22:25.280 --> 0:22:30.800
To be honest I haven't seen them and I will start working on some of them for a customer

196
0:22:30.800 --> 0:22:35.880
project in just a few weeks probably.

197
0:22:35.880 --> 0:22:42.480
The idea is that basically because it's layer 2 you don't have much network stack above

198
0:22:42.480 --> 0:22:49.600
the hardware layer so if you can cut some of the Linux networking stack because you

199
0:22:49.600 --> 0:22:56.920
don't use it anyway you work on raw sockets anyway you could just cut some of that out

200
0:22:56.920 --> 0:23:05.240
and try to achieve lower latencies in your basically Linux stack there.

201
0:23:05.240 --> 0:23:10.640
Probably on the next Fostom I can probably give you a talk on that.

202
0:23:10.640 --> 0:23:14.960
This is probably a big question but how do you go about debugging this sort of stuff

203
0:23:14.960 --> 0:23:21.320
so like setting it up or if you think there's a problem how do you go about finding problems?

204
0:23:21.320 --> 0:23:29.800
That's actually a bit of a pain point and you have to know at least a bit what's same

205
0:23:29.800 --> 0:23:37.560
values for like path delays for the PTP and stuff are and one of the most useful debugging

206
0:23:37.560 --> 0:23:43.840
tools I found so far is a good Ethernet switch because it will give you like output for your

207
0:23:43.840 --> 0:23:49.720
stream reservations so it will give you output for your PTP or GPTP.

208
0:23:49.720 --> 0:23:58.400
You can also like sniff traffic with wire taps basically and analyze it in Wireshark

209
0:23:58.400 --> 0:24:03.240
or Skypy or whatever your tool of choice is.

210
0:24:03.240 --> 0:24:07.920
That works best to be honest for 100 megabit links because you can use passive taps.

211
0:24:07.920 --> 0:24:14.920
It doesn't work that great for gigabit links because it violates some of the sounds a bit.

212
0:24:14.920 --> 0:24:21.880
You can also use like mirror ports and switches to exfiltrate traffic but basically it's a

213
0:24:21.880 --> 0:24:29.360
more manual approach of debugging and I'd like to get in touch with if anyone is interested

214
0:24:29.360 --> 0:24:41.040
in just write me an email to start a community based project of automated analysis of TSN

215
0:24:41.040 --> 0:24:46.320
links basically because I think it's something we really really need especially for people

216
0:24:46.320 --> 0:24:53.560
who aren't that deep into the standards and we need to make sure that we can basically

217
0:24:53.560 --> 0:25:01.120
have a one click check and set up and can tell from a tool that at least if that looks

218
0:25:01.120 --> 0:25:08.200
okayish or not what you're doing but I'm not aware of any project so far so I'd like to

219
0:25:08.200 --> 0:25:15.320
start but I'm not too experienced in how to start such a project so if you're experienced

220
0:25:15.320 --> 0:25:20.720
in that or are interested in that just write me an email get in touch and maybe we can

221
0:25:20.720 --> 0:25:24.520
set up something.

222
0:25:24.520 --> 0:25:33.280
Any more questions for the last one?

223
0:25:33.280 --> 0:25:44.600
You mentioned some protocols for link redundancy, can it also be used for node redundancy?

224
0:25:44.600 --> 0:25:48.120
I'm not entirely sure.

225
0:25:48.120 --> 0:25:54.680
I would have to look something up.

226
0:25:54.680 --> 0:26:01.560
I think basically it should because it's about the data path so if one node drops out basically

227
0:26:01.560 --> 0:26:06.680
that would work as well but it won't work for the endpoints so for the talk of the listener

228
0:26:06.680 --> 0:26:15.560
of course it won't work but for nodes in the middle of your graph that would probably work.

229
0:26:15.560 --> 0:26:16.560
Thank you very much again for your presentation.

230
0:26:16.560 --> 0:26:32.440
Thank you.
