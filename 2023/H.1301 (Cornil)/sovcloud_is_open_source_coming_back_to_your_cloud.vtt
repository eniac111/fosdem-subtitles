00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
So, welcome to the second talk of today in the sovereign cloud def room.

00:11.520 --> 00:16.200
And I'm very happy that Peter, founder of Pecona, is with us.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.400
And this is now your stage, Peter.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.400
Welcome.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.400
Okay.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
Thank you.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.400
Thank you.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.400
Oh, one.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.400
That's fantastic.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.400
Okay.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.960
Well, so we're going to talk today.

00:29.960 --> 00:39.000
And about wonderful topic of open source and its relationship with the cloud.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.120
Now, I think most of you don't know me.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.980
And I thought I would highlight my perspective first, right?

00:48.980 --> 00:54.080
So you can understand maybe where I'm coming from better.

00:54.080 --> 01:03.040
Myself, I was involved in open source since late 90s, which now seems like a long time

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
ago.

01:04.040 --> 01:10.440
I was at that time building my first startup back in Russia.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.800
And I took unconventional decision to use open source rather than stealing property

01:16.800 --> 01:24.400
software, which was the most conventional thing to do in Russia in late 90s.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.800
Afterwards, I joined MySQL AB before Oracle, before Sunmet.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.720
That was like a tiny company without 40 people.

01:34.720 --> 01:43.120
And that's where I got a lot of exposure in building and sort of promoting open source.

01:43.120 --> 01:50.640
And I also was their founder and until recently CEO of Percona, a company which specializes

01:50.640 --> 01:55.160
in open source databases, right?

01:55.160 --> 01:59.760
And we release all our software as open source.

01:59.760 --> 02:05.000
And since that time, I was also involved as advisor, mentor, investor, in some case, in

02:05.000 --> 02:12.320
various companies around open source space, right?

02:12.320 --> 02:18.880
If you want to summarize all that kind of presentation, a couple of words, would be

02:18.880 --> 02:19.880
probably this, right?

02:19.880 --> 02:24.720
I believe what everything being equal, open source is a better choice, right?

02:24.720 --> 02:27.600
Of course, you tell me it's never everything equal.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.560
But then I think this second thing applies, right?

02:32.560 --> 02:41.040
I think as a member of community, employee, right, maybe manager of a company, it is always

02:41.040 --> 02:48.280
better for you long term to invest your time, invest your resources into the open source

02:48.280 --> 02:55.240
rather than just send that to some, you know, proprietary vendor, right, which will provide

02:55.240 --> 03:00.040
more value to them than to you.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.200
Now one thing to understand about open source is that the open source takes time.

03:05.200 --> 03:14.360
This is a slide I shamelessly stole from a talk from Bruce with his last name, nobody

03:14.360 --> 03:17.280
can pronounce, so I won't ever try it, right?

03:17.280 --> 03:24.800
But this is the Bruce in PostgreSQL community, right, who often talks about PostgreSQL and

03:24.800 --> 03:29.800
open source, and he uses this chart which says, hey, you know what, if you look at compared

03:29.800 --> 03:38.240
to the property software, open source tend to take a long time, right, because if you

03:38.240 --> 03:46.120
think about saying, hey, you know what, I get one kind of, you know, get a small team

03:46.120 --> 03:50.320
together, you know, fund them and say, hey, build this, they can do it faster compared

03:50.320 --> 03:56.880
to open source, which is kind of a lot more organic fluid, a lot more discussions, you

03:56.880 --> 04:04.200
know, a lot more, you know, people operate maybe on a volunteer basis, each takes time,

04:04.200 --> 04:13.360
but then over time it overtakes the property software according to many criteria in many

04:13.360 --> 04:15.040
areas.

04:15.040 --> 04:22.360
And as example which I would use is this, like Linux and Solaris.

04:22.360 --> 04:30.840
When I was getting started with open source, I have a lot of friends which were running

04:26.620 --> 04:38.440
ration system, you know, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, anybody remember those?

04:30.840 --> 04:38.440
a real unique super-

04:38.440 --> 04:45.960
Right, and they would think like, well, Linux, that is a toy, right, that's like a 32-bit

04:45.960 --> 04:52.200
super-ration system at that time, doesn't handle, you know, multiple CPUs, well, you

04:52.200 --> 04:58.640
could not even at the time have a file more than 2 gigabytes in size, right, I mean, you

04:58.640 --> 05:05.920
know, like sounds like a joke, right, and right for if so, but well, where are we here

05:05.920 --> 05:12.240
now, right, I mean, how many of you guys still run in HPUX, anyone?

05:12.240 --> 05:17.440
No, like, AIX, Solaris probably, maybe there should be one or two people, no?

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
No Solaris folks?

05:18.440 --> 05:25.880
Well, we can see what over time Linux, if it's kind of slow and messy at times, development

05:25.880 --> 05:35.240
progress, right, really overtook that there are other operating systems, right, especially

05:35.240 --> 05:43.320
if you look at the server side, right, then Linux is well-dominated.

05:43.320 --> 05:49.160
Now we can also look, if you look at the cloud, we can see another comparison here, right,

05:49.160 --> 05:57.320
I remember also back in those early 90s, where folks would be using, you know, ASP.NET with

05:57.320 --> 06:03.960
Windows stacks, and wow, it is so fantastic, if you graphical user interfaces, whatever,

06:03.960 --> 06:14.320
to us open source folks who would be coding, you know, PHP or Perl in VI, right, or Emacs,

06:14.320 --> 06:22.520
right, if you are from the other camp, right, in that time, right, which was very different,

06:22.520 --> 06:30.000
right, but if you look at how things developed right now, now we have a fantastic development

06:30.000 --> 06:38.800
framework, right, very efficient for many open source frameworks, right, that things

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
evolve.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.120
Now, at the same time, if you look at the cloud standpoint, we are kind of in a similar

06:44.120 --> 06:45.360
situation.

06:45.360 --> 06:53.000
You can even go to this kind of very polished, integrated, yada, yada, but very proprietary

06:53.000 --> 07:01.440
stacks which Amazon or many other proprietary huge cloud vendors are ready to provide you,

07:01.440 --> 07:09.240
right, or you can have open source solutions which are not yet as polished, powerful, integrated,

07:09.240 --> 07:17.800
and so on and so forth, right, but I believe, well, they are going to get there.

07:17.800 --> 07:23.320
Now what I want at this point to talk a little bit more about where we are now in kind of

07:23.320 --> 07:28.600
a state of ecosystem, what is happening and what the trends are.

07:28.600 --> 07:35.080
One, if you think about relationship with clouds and open source, you can say, well,

07:35.080 --> 07:43.400
from one side, the cloud vendors have been making the open source a lot easier for other

07:43.400 --> 07:44.400
people, right?

07:44.400 --> 07:50.400
And if you look at deploying some open source technology, especially it applies, I would

07:50.400 --> 07:56.480
say, to the databases, it's much easier to get, let's say, Postgres running in a cloud

07:56.480 --> 08:04.080
vendor compared to getting your kind of, well, you know, highly available, monitored backup

08:04.080 --> 08:10.160
for a Postgres cluster on virtual machines, right?

08:10.160 --> 08:16.240
But on the other hand, we can also see all those cloud vendors use this kind of an old

08:16.240 --> 08:22.200
strategy, which actually they used even before the cloud, which is called Embrace, Extend,

08:22.200 --> 08:23.800
Extinguish, right?

08:23.800 --> 08:28.280
And what that means is, hey, you know, why don't we take the open source, we make it

08:28.280 --> 08:30.800
fancier?

08:30.800 --> 08:35.760
Fancy may mean more features like in a database space, well, where I come from would be something

08:35.760 --> 08:37.520
like Amazon Aurora.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.720
It's wonderful, there are those kind of additional features, better performance, wherever, or

08:41.720 --> 08:47.360
maybe more usable, maybe there's like a fancy GUI, so you can deploy it with a couple of

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
clicks, right?

08:48.360 --> 08:55.080
Instead of, oh, I have to put some elbow grease, right, to do it the open source way, but then,

08:55.080 --> 09:01.000
yes, you go there and you kind of check in in the Hotel California, right?

09:01.000 --> 09:09.560
Which if you know the song, you can't really ever leave, leave again, right?

09:09.560 --> 09:14.040
Now what I think in this case, it's important to understand and for all of us as open source

09:14.040 --> 09:20.280
developers to recognize what really the usability and ease of view is increasingly becoming

09:20.280 --> 09:26.880
that is a new frontier of the competition, right?

09:26.880 --> 09:34.480
And I think that is especially hard maybe for people for my generation, which got used

09:34.480 --> 09:37.800
to that very kind of hairy open source, right?

09:37.800 --> 09:42.480
At that time, we remember, you know, compiling open source from source, right?

09:42.480 --> 09:45.880
And kind of we have all that skills, right?

09:45.880 --> 09:53.880
But if you think what is happening right now in a software industry in general, as well

09:53.880 --> 10:02.040
in open source is this, one is a software just, you know, absolutely explodes in amount,

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
right?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.280
Everything is software those days, right?

10:05.280 --> 10:09.800
Amount of software which is being written will need to be written, need to be maintained,

10:09.800 --> 10:16.040
extend, and so on and so forth is, you know, absolutely amazing and growing every year.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.600
The same happens with data, right?

10:17.600 --> 10:23.120
We're having more and more data and more and more ways to process and whatever that data

10:23.120 --> 10:26.160
for good and for evil, right?

10:26.160 --> 10:36.360
But at the same time, we are have to do that with less and especially with skills, right?

10:36.360 --> 10:44.200
You can see as a software engineer and technology industry as well, we have a lot of people

10:44.200 --> 10:51.880
getting in that stuff which are not going to really be able to debug Linux kernel code,

10:51.880 --> 10:59.080
right, to, you know, have some, you know, just obvious basic skills, right?

10:59.080 --> 11:10.560
Well, for them, you need to build a software which is easier to use.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.640
The fact I think what is very interesting is what we can see increasingly some expert,

11:16.640 --> 11:25.520
even in related to open source technologies which actually only have cloud specific skills,

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
right?

11:26.520 --> 11:31.560
Well, especially in the US, right, I think adoption of a cloud is substantially forward

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
on, right?

11:32.560 --> 11:37.800
You may have somebody saying, you know, I am, you know, post-gres-ql expert, right?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.440
And you talk to them what that means.

11:39.440 --> 11:46.760
He is very capable of provisioning, you know, post-gres-ql aurora on AWS with two clicks,

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
right?

11:47.760 --> 11:49.160
But you say, like, well, you know what, what is patroni?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
You say, what?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
What?

11:51.160 --> 11:56.920
Well, that's like some high-availability solution for post-gres, right, if you guys don't know,

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
right?

11:57.920 --> 12:02.640
Which is very basic.

12:02.640 --> 12:11.160
I think another interesting thing is what, especially in the large corporation standpoint,

12:11.160 --> 12:15.800
a lot of them run to build their businesses by the book, right?

12:15.800 --> 12:21.840
So if a management made a choice, what we are adopting, let's say, Amazon cloud or Google

12:21.840 --> 12:27.360
cloud, Azure doesn't matter, they often then would come to them and say, okay, how do we

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
do that?

12:28.360 --> 12:30.080
Give us the book, right?

12:30.080 --> 12:32.840
And what are those cloud vendors going to tell?

12:32.840 --> 12:37.840
Oh, they're not going to tell you, well, you know what, use our basic services which you

12:37.840 --> 12:39.440
find in the other cloud.

12:39.440 --> 12:46.400
They are going to tell you to use the most proper, advanced, you know, managed solution,

12:46.400 --> 12:47.400
right?

12:47.400 --> 12:52.360
If you read with Amazon, they'll say, hey, you know, go use DynamoDB, right?

12:52.360 --> 12:53.760
It's awesome, right?

12:53.760 --> 13:01.280
Or it's Amazon Aurora, Redshift, all that kind of stuff which makes you the most sticky

13:01.280 --> 13:09.480
for the cloud and which is also providing the most margin to those folks, right?

13:09.480 --> 13:13.960
So what is also interesting in this case, right, if you look for Amazon Aurora, for

13:13.960 --> 13:21.280
example, as they see their customers getting more and more lock-in, the price differential

13:21.280 --> 13:29.160
between their, your computer sources, right, you know, storage, right, and essentially

13:29.160 --> 13:32.920
like in the software, it becoming larger and larger, right?

13:32.920 --> 13:39.360
If every new generation of CPU can actually, you know, find that excuse, right?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.760
So find that changes.

13:42.760 --> 13:49.440
So that means it becomes more and more expensive over time, right?

13:49.440 --> 13:55.280
And also you will see in this environment also really embracing scaling by the credit

13:55.280 --> 13:57.320
card, right?

13:57.320 --> 14:01.120
Because scaling is easy, right?

14:01.120 --> 14:06.600
You don't have to figure out how to run the TAT server you have because getting the next

14:06.600 --> 14:11.440
one would, bigger one would take three months, right, even if you get a budget approved,

14:11.440 --> 14:12.440
right?

14:12.440 --> 14:14.400
Like we used to have like 10, 15 years ago.

14:14.400 --> 14:19.720
Now, you know, screw that optimization skills, right, you can just go to the larger instance

14:19.720 --> 14:24.320
size, right, and that's easy.

14:24.320 --> 14:29.760
And again, like from what we see from a database standpoint, a lot of databases in the cloud

14:29.760 --> 14:36.600
are optimized very poorly exactly because of that trend.

14:36.600 --> 14:42.280
Now what is interesting for me also is how that plays with their venture-funded open

14:42.280 --> 14:48.480
source, which is a lot of open source those days, of course, right?

14:48.480 --> 14:58.960
And what we can see is what they are really for protestions against unfair competition

14:58.960 --> 15:02.040
from a cloud vendors, yada, yada, right?

15:02.040 --> 15:11.640
And many of them abandon open source licenses, right, and go to something else, right, which

15:11.640 --> 15:22.320
is well, really shifting to a proprietary software models.

15:22.320 --> 15:28.360
Now this is, in my opinion, is very different from a community-driven open source, right?

15:28.360 --> 15:33.320
If you think about, well, compare something like PostgreSQL to Mongo, right, which I think

15:33.320 --> 15:50.480
is in the database space very opposite on that kind of open source, the

15:50.480 --> 16:05.200
from a adoption standpoint, right, because cloud made PostgreSQL much easier for a lot

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
of people, right?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.120
But at the same time, of course, now there are different players which dominate the ecosystem.

16:09.120 --> 16:15.040
Yes, it used to be enterprise DB was the biggest dog, right?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.520
Well now it is probably Amazon, right?

16:17.520 --> 16:21.120
And other cloud vendors make more money, but you know what?

16:21.120 --> 16:27.600
They are hiring a lot of PostgreSQL engineers and investing a lot still to make a PostgreSQL

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
better.

16:28.600 --> 16:37.440
So at large extent, PostgreSQL community still benefits in this regard.

16:37.440 --> 16:43.600
What also have been interesting for me in the last decade or so is the idea of growth

16:43.600 --> 16:45.460
at any cost, right?

16:45.460 --> 16:50.360
For a lot of companies you can find, well, at least in the US stock market, you know,

16:50.360 --> 16:57.800
the more money company is losing, the better its valuation, right?

16:57.800 --> 17:03.680
As long as you can grow a user base as well, right?

17:03.680 --> 17:09.600
And in this case, you really gravitated saying, how can I grow faster?

17:09.600 --> 17:18.280
That means focus my resources and cloud, which often allows you to, well, things simple,

17:18.280 --> 17:20.120
though expensive, right?

17:20.120 --> 17:24.440
Was very much adopted, right?

17:24.440 --> 17:31.720
And for those companies, often didn't make sense to invest in efficiency, which I think

17:31.720 --> 17:34.360
open source often brings ease, right?

17:34.360 --> 17:39.920
Even though it requires a little bit more investment than elbow grease kind of and management

17:39.920 --> 17:43.520
attention to make those things happen.

17:43.520 --> 17:50.680
Even more though, you can see the cloud has been quite good at giving you your first short

17:50.680 --> 17:53.480
of heroin for free, right?

17:53.480 --> 17:58.160
You can find what every cloud author is saying, hey, oh, you're a startup, great.

17:58.160 --> 18:04.680
We'll give you some big chunk of money so you can spend on us, right?

18:04.680 --> 18:07.600
Or given the free tea, right?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.600
And wherever solution.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.360
Well, but I guess with this analogy, you understand, right?

18:15.360 --> 18:23.120
Well, if somebody giving you a short of heroin for free, they may not always have your best

18:23.120 --> 18:27.120
interest in mind, right?

18:27.120 --> 18:36.680
Now, I think what is interesting is what there are some revelations which are coming, right?

18:36.680 --> 18:40.400
I think in this case, and things are changing.

18:40.400 --> 18:45.120
And I will provide a bunch of links to the detailed articles here, right, which you guys

18:45.120 --> 18:47.560
can check when you saw the cloud.

18:47.560 --> 18:54.000
Like this is interesting from this trillion dollar paradox, right, which talks about,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.360
well, you know what, cloud is damn expensive.

18:57.360 --> 19:04.840
And for many cloud companies, the very large portion of their cost of revenue is actually

19:04.840 --> 19:06.640
cloud spent, right?

19:06.640 --> 19:12.160
So if you are choosing to go with that cloud, especially kind of most expensive persons

19:12.160 --> 19:17.480
on that, well, you know what, you have to be giving up on a lot of potential profit

19:17.480 --> 19:18.800
margin.

19:18.800 --> 19:25.880
Recently, you may also have this 37 signals which talk about while they are leaving the

19:25.880 --> 19:29.640
cloud and they detailed that stuff.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.880
That is also like a very influential company, right?

19:32.880 --> 19:36.520
It's not very big dollar amounts, right, compared to enterprise here.

19:36.520 --> 19:41.280
But I think it's very nice what they kind of went public in this case and say, hey,

19:41.280 --> 19:48.720
guys, even in our scale, even if you spend in maybe, you know, like a less than $10 million

19:48.720 --> 19:55.560
dollars, right, a year on the cloud, it makes sense, right, to actually do things differently,

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
right?

19:56.560 --> 20:00.800
And $10 million may sound like a lot of money to some of you, but if you look at even kind

20:00.800 --> 20:08.560
of like a mid-size and, well, especially more like logic operations, they often spend hundreds

20:08.560 --> 20:14.840
of millions on dollars on the cloud spend.

20:14.840 --> 20:22.080
Now another trend which I think is interesting, which is coming out, I think is GitOps and

20:22.080 --> 20:30.400
generally the approaches where we have declarative versioned infrastructure as a code approach,

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
right?

20:31.400 --> 20:37.880
Because when you do that, then often those kind of fancy, gooey point and click I can

20:37.880 --> 20:45.240
do in the cloud is not exactly how you do things anymore, right?

20:45.240 --> 20:51.360
That's where you kind of sort of do it more of a, well, through, you know, API, you know,

20:51.360 --> 20:54.680
command line, if you will, right, things there.

20:54.680 --> 21:01.320
Open source tooling is already better.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.480
Hybrid cloud is another interesting trend, right?

21:04.480 --> 21:11.920
And what I want you to see from this graph is what if you look at the larger the corporation

21:11.920 --> 21:17.760
is, the more of them are embracing the hybrid cloud, right?

21:17.760 --> 21:22.560
That's from the CNCF poll, right?

21:22.560 --> 21:28.880
And if you are using public, if you're using hybrid clouds, multiple cloud vendors, you

21:28.880 --> 21:35.080
know, public and private cloud to give event, you probably do not want to rely too much

21:35.080 --> 21:39.440
on those, you know, property services, right?

21:39.440 --> 21:44.120
Because they tend not to be as portable.

21:44.120 --> 21:51.640
In the end, I think what you are, what we are seeing the open source kind of catches

21:51.640 --> 21:56.180
up again, leaving us with kind of two choices here.

21:56.180 --> 22:00.560
If you look at the AWS, which is obviously the biggest dog where you can replace that

22:00.560 --> 22:02.840
with, you know, Azure, GCP, right?

22:02.840 --> 22:05.800
Or, you know, some other major cloud.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.280
You can really lock in the approach of a cloud vendor, right?

22:10.280 --> 22:20.880
Or you can use their cloud native foundation stack, right, among others, right, where you

22:20.880 --> 22:26.600
are really treating cloud as a commodity and building the value through their open source

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
software.

22:27.600 --> 22:40.140
What I think is interesting from a cloud native environment is how big it is, right?

22:40.140 --> 22:46.280
You guys probably cannot even see all the logos, right, on the slide, right?

22:46.280 --> 22:48.600
There is a lot out there.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.880
There is typically more than one solution for a single problem, right?

22:52.880 --> 22:58.400
And some of you say, hey, that is too much, but that is also the open source way, right?

22:58.400 --> 23:04.360
In many cases, we need in open source multiple solutions to the same problems, right, which

23:04.360 --> 23:10.240
will kind of evolve, right, and maybe some of you will die off, I will join forces together,

23:10.240 --> 23:14.280
and that is how great stuff happens, right?

23:14.280 --> 23:21.000
But I wanted to show that just to illustrate how much momentum there is behind their open

23:21.000 --> 23:22.800
source approach.

23:22.800 --> 23:32.600
Now, I think in this case, what that allows us is to really, given the proprietary cloud,

23:32.600 --> 23:38.720
it is originally intended role of commodity infrastructure.

23:38.720 --> 23:41.240
Why am I saying originally intended role?

23:41.240 --> 23:47.400
You can see this, this is actually the slide I took from some very old AWS presentation.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.280
Then they were just bringing the cloud to the master's and say, hey, guys, you know

23:51.280 --> 23:52.280
what?

23:52.280 --> 23:55.920
You don't usually run your own generator, right, at home.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.920
It's not convenient.

23:56.920 --> 24:01.760
Well, yes, in some cases it makes sense, but mostly you buy electricity.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.640
So you should buy the same from a cloud when it comes to compute resources, storage, yada,

24:06.640 --> 24:07.640
yada.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.640
It will make sense.

24:09.640 --> 24:13.440
But here is a key difference, right?

24:13.440 --> 24:16.320
If you buy the electricity, it is commodity.

24:16.320 --> 24:24.440
You can buy the electricity from a variety of vendors or make your own, and you're still

24:24.440 --> 24:26.080
all appliances going to work.

24:26.080 --> 24:33.520
You don't have to change your TV or your fridge if you're doing the other electricity, right?

24:33.520 --> 24:37.040
And that is kind of what a lot of cloud vendors want us to do, right?

24:37.040 --> 24:41.880
Well, we'll provide you commodity thing, right, electricity, but you know what?

24:41.880 --> 24:46.800
We also really want you to use those appliances which will only work with our kind of electricity.

24:46.800 --> 24:52.120
Well, that sounds like bullshit to me.

24:52.120 --> 25:00.640
So with this, I think we have really two choices, right, how we can approach those, the cloud,

25:00.640 --> 25:04.240
which I will call as the cloud of software on account of freedom.

25:04.240 --> 25:11.440
One is to use a lot of property features of your cloud vendors, sell your soul to the

25:11.440 --> 25:13.960
devil, right, and all the other stuff, right?

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
So let's vote.

25:14.960 --> 25:17.600
How many one is going to use that way?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.600
Any hands out there?

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
No?

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
No?

25:21.600 --> 25:25.240
I would surprise, I would accept there's some people working for Amazon here on some,

25:25.240 --> 25:27.240
I would say, yeah.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.560
Yes, yes, okay.

25:28.560 --> 25:34.040
And then we can use cloud of freedom, which is saying, well, cloud vendors are fine.

25:34.040 --> 25:39.880
It's like a good commodity infrastructure providers like the internet providers, right,

25:39.880 --> 25:45.120
just give us those commodity resources and we will build the rest of the stuff using

25:45.120 --> 25:46.120
open source.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.480
How many of you think that a good idea?

25:49.480 --> 25:53.160
Okay, okay, that's better.

25:53.160 --> 26:02.720
Okay, now in this regard, what I think is a very good API in this regard?

26:02.720 --> 26:08.400
Well, it is there, the Kubernetes, right?

26:08.400 --> 26:12.600
I would not say that Kubernetes is absolutely perfect.

26:12.600 --> 26:17.960
It's not, but I think what every successful open source project started as a piece of

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
crap, right?

26:18.960 --> 26:21.440
I mean, it's just how things go, right?

26:21.440 --> 26:28.840
Because you build successful open source projects not having a solid technical foundation despite

26:28.840 --> 26:37.040
what engineers want to believe, but building the movement, building the ecosystem, right?

26:37.040 --> 26:45.800
And then those ecosystems, right, well, is able to redo the code, right, mistakes, wherever

26:45.800 --> 26:48.600
and to build something, right?

26:48.600 --> 26:51.320
With Kubernetes example, I remember there was messes.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.520
Anybody remember messes?

26:53.520 --> 26:57.600
Well, that was a very cool project, right?

26:57.600 --> 27:02.680
I remember talking to those girls and they have, let's say five years ago, a lot of very

27:02.680 --> 27:06.200
cool things which Kubernetes did not have, but you know what?

27:06.200 --> 27:09.000
They lost adoption game.

27:09.000 --> 27:17.880
And now you can see with things like I have next, oh, no, sorry, next, their container

27:17.880 --> 27:19.640
storage interface and some other stuff.

27:19.640 --> 27:20.640
Hey, you know what?

27:20.640 --> 27:27.520
Kubernetes is getting a lot better for data intensive applications, right, not just for

27:27.520 --> 27:33.800
this narrow use case of stateless applications it was originally designed.

27:33.800 --> 27:41.120
We also now have either the data on Kubernetes community, right, which is a special community

27:41.120 --> 27:48.040
which is focused on running data intensive applications on Kubernetes, right?

27:48.040 --> 27:56.960
And what is interesting in this case from also the CNCF survey, we can actually see

27:56.960 --> 28:03.160
what from 2001 to 2002 the databases, right?

28:03.160 --> 28:11.480
So something which is technically was not something you would ever think to run on Kubernetes

28:11.480 --> 28:18.320
five years ago is one of the fastest growing application type which is being run on Kubernetes

28:18.320 --> 28:20.600
those days.

28:20.600 --> 28:29.760
Now I would say even more, what we see right now is if you look at a lot of modern independent

28:29.760 --> 28:33.720
database as a service providers, am I right?

28:33.720 --> 28:38.960
All of those folks, they are actually using Kubernetes on the back end to build their

28:38.960 --> 28:40.880
database as a service solution.

28:40.880 --> 28:47.640
You may not know that, you may not care, but they are doing that and that means for them

28:47.640 --> 28:54.320
well that is both efficient way to build it, operate it and that can be run, you know,

28:54.320 --> 28:59.240
stable enough like at least with a good skill.

28:59.240 --> 29:08.280
Another interesting result what's going on with Kubernetes is what we are having, well,

29:08.280 --> 29:13.000
despite having Kubernetes already quite ubiquitous, right?

29:13.000 --> 29:20.120
Hey, you can run it on pretty much any cloud if you look at many, you know, every distribution,

29:20.120 --> 29:26.400
a little distribution now have their own Kubernetes destroyed, at least a major one, right?

29:26.400 --> 29:35.680
You steal Kubernetes from VMware, right, and many other solutions right now, right?

29:35.680 --> 29:42.040
But we are also having Kubernetes come into other places like I like this K3S solution

29:42.040 --> 29:52.240
which is lightweight, Kubernetes, right, which you can deploy on the age IoT devices, right,

29:52.240 --> 29:58.000
or if you just have, you know, couple of servers in your basement that you want to run Kubernetes

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
on.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.920
We also are getting more solutions for visual kids, right, because if you look at, you know,

30:06.920 --> 30:13.280
like a ROC Kubernetes you often would be seeing that, you know, console and YAML files, right,

30:13.280 --> 30:14.280
and everything.

30:14.280 --> 30:20.840
But now we are also have a pretty good dashboard which comes with Kubernetes, a Skibernetes

30:20.840 --> 30:31.880
project, and as well integrations with applications, like there are solutions like kubep apps or

30:31.880 --> 30:37.080
Rancher application catalog, right, you can say, hey, you know, if I am running Kubernetes

30:37.080 --> 30:46.160
I can deploy open source and appropriate applications on my Kubernetes solution in a couple of clicks.

30:46.160 --> 30:57.320
Kind of similar to what we see now in their major clouds, right, where we have their marketplaces.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.640
Okay.

30:58.640 --> 31:09.880
So, with that, where do I think things need to be going and will be going next as we are

31:09.880 --> 31:14.080
getting more and more open source software in a cloud?

31:14.080 --> 31:20.160
One, we still need to continue working on the better integrations because I think that

31:20.160 --> 31:24.440
is the name of the game right now, right.

31:24.440 --> 31:31.240
We expect really all the software and the software and hardware to be very well integrated

31:31.240 --> 31:37.040
with each other, right, and that is something where I think a lot of property vendors put

31:37.040 --> 31:44.360
a lot of folks in, right, because if it is not easy to make two things work together,

31:44.360 --> 31:49.800
then for majority of the people it would not be accessible because remember what we spoke

31:49.800 --> 31:50.960
about?

31:50.960 --> 31:57.280
A lot of people do not have very advanced skills those days.

31:57.280 --> 32:01.080
Related thing, of course, is the better usability, right.

32:01.080 --> 32:09.760
I mean, we have expectations of usability very high, attention span very low, right.

32:09.760 --> 32:15.960
I mean, I am not sure if any of you have like teenage kids or am I just too old here, you

32:15.960 --> 32:16.960
know.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.160
What do you think about the attention span those days?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
Okay.

32:20.160 --> 32:26.800
Well, and remember, right, those teenagers are probably already doing some work with

32:26.800 --> 32:33.000
computers, right, you know, it is often taught as a middle school those days, some programming

32:33.000 --> 32:38.360
skills, right, and they will be going in the industry in the next few years.

32:38.360 --> 32:44.880
And the last thing I would mention and that is again maybe comes from my database background,

32:44.880 --> 32:51.080
right, is making sure we also have a good experience if at day two operations, not just

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
day one.

32:52.080 --> 32:57.440
In very many cases I see there is a lot of application catalogs and where ever say hey,

32:57.440 --> 33:02.200
look at that, you can develop that application very quickly, right, but then if you really

33:02.200 --> 33:06.280
want to maintain that, it is like, you know, with database you can't just, you know, tear

33:06.280 --> 33:08.480
it apart and deploy a new one.

33:08.480 --> 33:17.520
Well that is something which can become instantly quite complicated, right, if it is not handled

33:17.520 --> 33:18.520
well.

33:18.520 --> 33:26.400
Well, with that, I will end with my call to action, pretty much saying what I started,

33:26.400 --> 33:34.240
right, I would encourage you to embrace the open source in the cloud, also invest both

33:34.240 --> 33:40.400
in terms of your personal time and efforts and as well motivating your company to invest

33:40.400 --> 33:49.520
in making it better because open source very much depends on our collective effort, right,

33:49.520 --> 33:56.760
for its success and of course spread the world, that is how the movement grows.

33:56.760 --> 34:06.000
Well with that, it is all ahead and I would be happy to answer some questions.

34:06.000 --> 34:27.120
Thank you very much for your talk.

34:27.120 --> 34:32.560
You said in your final slide that people should be investing in open source and invest in

34:32.560 --> 34:33.560
making it better.

34:33.560 --> 34:39.240
What are your thoughts on the new kind of trend you see of organisations like the sovereign

34:39.240 --> 34:44.640
tech fund in Germany allocating millions to open source projects and things like that?

34:44.640 --> 34:48.360
Where do you think the money should come from rather than, or is there a structured way

34:48.360 --> 34:50.200
it should actually be allocated?

34:50.200 --> 34:56.000
Well, so where should money come from, right, from open source?

34:56.000 --> 35:00.400
Well look, I think that is a variety of things, right.

35:00.400 --> 35:05.720
I think if you look in this case like from the government standpoint, right, it is classically

35:05.720 --> 35:12.920
have been supporting, you know, public good with investment in research, right, the medicine,

35:12.920 --> 35:20.560
right, wherever, like I think that open source is one of such ways how you can create a lot

35:20.560 --> 35:24.760
of public good, right, which is wonderful.

35:24.760 --> 35:31.360
I think though in many cases probably where majority can come from, right, these are the

35:31.360 --> 35:35.840
public corporations, I don't know what probably private corporations, right, acting out of

35:35.840 --> 35:38.040
their own interest, right.

35:38.040 --> 35:43.480
I think in this case we all need to also work with that kind of like mentality change, right,

35:43.480 --> 35:48.640
because you see like for years, right, even before like a Microsoft changed it and became

35:48.640 --> 35:55.400
like all, you know, we love open source kind of company, right, it was all about like oh

35:55.400 --> 36:00.280
open source is evil, it's like, you know, communists run open source, right, that's

36:00.280 --> 36:07.480
how you, you know, lose all your, you know, property, right, open source is insecure,

36:07.480 --> 36:11.840
yada, yada, yada, right, and I think that is something there that's kind of spread the

36:11.840 --> 36:18.720
word is important, right, is to make sure well that is actually none of those things,

36:18.720 --> 36:25.400
right, and really embrace an open source and the focus on the real open source can be very

36:25.400 --> 36:32.160
good long term ROI for a corporation, so maybe not a short term, right, but the long term,

36:32.160 --> 36:33.160
right.

36:33.160 --> 36:37.080
Well in this case I probably want to mention one other thing which I think is still challenge

36:37.080 --> 36:38.400
those days, right.

36:38.400 --> 36:45.360
I think what the open source term is being bastardized, right, we can see many companies

36:45.360 --> 36:50.720
they try to say oh our software is kind of almost as good as open source, right, and

36:50.720 --> 36:58.960
but then they put you like well some very specially restrictive licenses, right, in

36:58.960 --> 37:04.040
this case, right, and we need, right, or have like an open core when you have like a crippled

37:04.040 --> 37:10.960
open source, right, and real property software and we need to make sure the company understand

37:10.960 --> 37:22.000
where is what is open source, right, and focus on growing that compared to those, well, others.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.920
Make sense?

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Thank you.

37:24.920 --> 37:30.000
Hello, thank you for the presentation.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.560
In the beginning we started with a good willingness to make it very portable to other cloud and

37:36.560 --> 37:42.440
that kind of stuff having the deployment that can be multi-cloud and we missed something

37:42.440 --> 37:49.360
because at some point the experts that were there to help us were pushing for some proprietary

37:49.360 --> 37:56.000
or non-compatible deployment and we are totally stuck now in one cloud provider.

37:56.000 --> 38:02.080
How do you manage such a risk and what would you put as a rule set at the beginning so

38:02.080 --> 38:04.080
that you would not fall in that pitfall?

38:04.080 --> 38:08.080
Yeah, well I think that's a very question, I can say hey we made a mistake and now we

38:08.080 --> 38:16.280
are stuck, right, well, I think in this case, right, if you're looking at portability, right,

38:16.280 --> 38:23.280
I think it's important what that portability is being tested, right, so in your case, right,

38:23.280 --> 38:30.000
maybe you say hey we are mostly around that one cloud vendor and we want to be able to

38:30.000 --> 38:35.440
move to other cloud vendor if we need, well that means what you need to regularly test

38:35.440 --> 38:40.720
your software that actually works on that cloud vendor so if incompatibility and over

38:40.720 --> 38:45.800
reliance is introduced you can instantly squash that because if you don't do it, right, then

38:45.800 --> 38:50.040
you know like three years later, right, then you finally want to do that you can say oh

38:50.040 --> 38:56.360
my gosh, it actually turns out so much the things what we did not do, right, and I think

38:56.360 --> 39:05.200
in many cases what is also important is what developers do not read docs, right, they tinker,

39:05.200 --> 39:10.920
right, and often then you think like oh I'm using this kind of feature, right, in this

39:10.920 --> 39:16.400
case I assume it works everywhere but maybe they are actually, you know, using something

39:16.400 --> 39:22.400
which only works in this particular place, right, that is why testing is important, you

39:22.400 --> 39:28.320
cannot rely on, you know, the developers, right, infrastructure engineers just, you

39:28.320 --> 39:36.160
know, using their subset they are supposed to be using.

39:36.160 --> 39:50.720
Okay, well, thank you.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.760
Hi, thank you.

39:52.760 --> 40:00.600
When we have some companies using proprietary cloud provider, we, it is difficult for us

40:00.600 --> 40:11.760
to say that they need to move all their infrastructure as you just said, so is it a problem of offer,

40:11.760 --> 40:19.640
it is a problem of the free software cloud provider offer to provide some easy tools

40:19.640 --> 40:27.120
to use or it is really a problem of politics from the companies to say that yeah, we should

40:27.120 --> 40:34.320
go to the difficult but free software, how do we manage with that?

40:34.320 --> 40:40.600
Well, I mean, you're asking like is that like a technical question, right, or is it politics,

40:40.600 --> 40:46.280
right, and the question is both, right, in this case, like yes, I mean if you look from

40:46.280 --> 40:53.480
a technical standpoint I think there easier is if open source software where more is going

40:53.480 --> 41:00.600
to be, you know, easy to convince, adopt, right, and so on and so forth, but in many

41:00.600 --> 41:08.600
cases it is possible, it is also like a politics, right, because there are, can be some entrenched

41:08.600 --> 41:12.480
interest for whatever reasons, right, or some belief, right.

41:12.480 --> 41:17.160
I have seen a number of companies in my works, right, where people say oh my gosh, we are

41:17.160 --> 41:23.280
running on, let's say that like a Microsoft stack, there is no freaking way it's possible

41:23.280 --> 41:28.880
we move to open source, yada, yada, yada, yada, right, and then we have a new CTO, right,

41:28.880 --> 41:34.320
and boom, right, you can say in a few years, right, like more than half of workloads are

41:34.320 --> 41:40.200
moved to the, you know, to the different open source solution, right.

41:40.200 --> 41:46.520
So I think in this case, like if you look at what is a primary thing, right, it is politics

41:46.520 --> 41:58.800
and desire of a management, right, that is always a primary thing.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
Thank you Peter.

41:59.800 --> 42:00.800
Okay.

42:00.800 --> 42:19.620
I will now like boundary this.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.580
Okay.

42:22.580 --> 42:29.020
Thank you Peter.
