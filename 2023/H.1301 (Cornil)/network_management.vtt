WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.180
Thank you.

00:08.180 --> 00:10.480
So guys, there are some more seats.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.480
Please have a seat.

00:12.480 --> 00:17.440
And whenever you want, we can start.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.440
Okay.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.440
All right.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.440
So let's start.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.440
Welcome, everyone.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
My name is Fernando.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.160
I'm a senior software engineer at Red Hat.

00:25.160 --> 00:30.720
I work on the networking services team, mainly focused on network management.

00:30.720 --> 00:40.960
So today I'm going to talk how we can do networking management more simple and how we can make

00:40.960 --> 00:45.040
the life of sysadmins a little bit better.

00:45.040 --> 00:50.720
I know that network management can be complex, especially because most of the sysadmins

00:50.720 --> 00:56.720
need to sometimes configure networking, and maybe they are not network experts.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.720
So all right.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.240
The first thing is what is network manager.

01:01.240 --> 01:07.320
So network manager is the standard Linux network configuration tool suite.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.240
Basically it's almost on every distribution, and it configures networking.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.520
It's just like that.

01:13.520 --> 01:21.400
It takes care of setting the IP address, all the properties, manage routes, manage DNS,

01:21.400 --> 01:27.440
manage almost everything, and make sure that when other to modify the network configuration,

01:27.440 --> 01:32.600
it will notify network manager, will update the status, et cetera, et cetera.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.960
Network manager provides the bus API, and also they have their own library to communicate

01:37.960 --> 01:40.720
with the daemon, which is libnm.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.480
And this is why there are some tools built around network manager.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.680
For example, I know that some of you know them, Nmappler, Nm2, Nmcli, or Nmcloud setup.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.560
And there are more, and we are building more of them.

01:54.560 --> 02:00.040
So as I said, the network manager daemon is the backend that we are going to use for the

02:00.040 --> 02:03.840
new tool, NMS state.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.320
And NMS state is a little bit special because it's declarative.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.720
So the idea here is that as a user, you just need to define what do you want to configure,

02:12.720 --> 02:14.760
and you don't need to care about the hope.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.880
So you can define the state, you can define what IP address do you want, you can define

02:20.880 --> 02:26.600
what properties, if it's a bond, the bond properties, if it's a bridge, whatever you

02:26.600 --> 02:32.240
want, and NMS state will take care of it, and will do, will resolve all the interdependencies

02:32.240 --> 02:33.840
between the interfaces.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.840
We configure the routes, we configure everything that is needed to make it work.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.480
And we use network manager as a backend, we communicate with network manager for applying

02:44.480 --> 02:50.360
the configuration, but we perform some operations that we are going to talk later, and we needed

02:50.360 --> 02:53.920
Nispor to communicate with Kana.

02:53.920 --> 03:00.240
So we had a problem, initially we were using CFS, and it was not working well, and we decided

03:00.240 --> 03:05.080
to create Nispor, which is another library, written in Rust, that allows you to communicate

03:05.080 --> 03:09.600
with Kana and get real-time network configuration from Kana.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.440
So the first question could be why Nell link, and why not CFS?

03:14.440 --> 03:16.160
So CFS is not an API.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.080
You need to understand that, because I know that a lot of people build their tools parsing

03:21.080 --> 03:28.200
CFS, writing on CFS, using CFS everywhere, and this could be problematic, because CFS

03:28.200 --> 03:33.600
is not an API, and if you read the documentation, it's not stable.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.680
It can break between releases.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.040
But Nell link is an API.

03:39.040 --> 03:47.320
Nell link is stable, it's not deprecated, because CFS is deprecated, so most of the

03:47.320 --> 03:53.640
new network options that they are adding into Kana, they are not providing a CFS interface.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.680
And also, Nell link use sockets, and that's great, because you don't need to open a file,

03:58.680 --> 04:02.120
read it, parse it, and then get the proper value.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.520
Using sockets, you can get the attribute, you know the type, you communicate through

04:06.520 --> 04:11.320
the Nell link sockets, you get the value, and you get proper errors, so everything is

04:11.320 --> 04:13.320
better.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.400
Okay, so then let's go to the important part.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
So NMS.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.840
NMS does everything, you don't need to do anything, you just need to define what do you want, and

04:23.840 --> 04:29.560
ideally you will apply that state, and everything will be configured after some operations.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.600
Sometimes it's not like that, so we have a lot of steps in the middle.

04:33.600 --> 04:39.120
We do, for example, validation, we do normalization and verification, we are going to explain

04:39.120 --> 04:41.520
them later.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.960
And also, it will point you what is going wrong, so you can fix it.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.720
So for example, if you are configuring a MAC address, and this MAC address is not being

04:49.720 --> 04:54.160
configured correctly, it will point you which MAC address is configured on kener, and what

04:54.160 --> 04:56.320
is the one that you wanted to configure.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.960
And right, you need to solve that.

04:58.960 --> 05:05.240
Also if you put invalid IP address, it will tell you this IP address is not valid, please

05:05.240 --> 05:06.240
change it.

05:06.240 --> 05:11.640
Okay, or for example, if you configure one great thing is that if you configure an MTU

05:11.640 --> 05:18.200
that is bigger than the one supported by the driver, it will let you know about that.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.080
Okay, so one thing is that, did you misconfigure something?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.920
Good, we can do a rollback.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.640
Let's talk a little bit about rollbacks.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.920
So this is already supported in Node Manager, this is not new from NMS state, but it's a

05:30.920 --> 05:32.880
little bit complex to use.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.880
And in NMS state, we simplify it.

05:35.880 --> 05:43.000
So basically all the time that you do an operation, and NMS state do the verification, and if

05:43.000 --> 05:47.800
something goes wrong, it's rollback to the previous state.

05:47.800 --> 05:54.240
But we can also, maybe nothing go wrong, but you lost connectivity because you removed

05:54.240 --> 06:00.800
the IP address, and we cannot know if that is what you wanted or not, I mean, we as NMS

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
state.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.520
So we allow you to define an option which is no commit, so you can say this simple command

06:07.520 --> 06:12.560
NMS state CTL apply, the jammer file, we are going to see the format of the jammer file

06:12.560 --> 06:15.680
later, then no commit and a timeout time.

06:15.680 --> 06:20.600
If you don't specify a timeout, it's going to be 60 seconds by default.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.280
So what happened if it went well?

06:24.280 --> 06:27.400
It's what you wanted, you have connectivity, everything is good.

06:27.400 --> 06:33.600
Okay, then NMS state CTL commit, and the configuration will be there permanently.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.200
But what happens if you notice that you mess up?

06:36.200 --> 06:40.000
All right, NMS state CTL rollback, and you're going to be on the previous state.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.120
This is really great because it's really time when you misconfigure something and then you

06:46.120 --> 06:47.960
need to undo it manually.

06:47.960 --> 06:54.520
So this time you just do a rollback and everything will be like before.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.920
And what happened when you are working on a remote on a server and you lose connectivity

06:58.920 --> 07:02.400
and you end free travel to the data center?

07:02.400 --> 07:08.320
Right, now with this tool you can, with a timeout, if you lose connectivity, you are

07:08.320 --> 07:12.840
not going to be able to do the commit, so at some point it will rollback and you will

07:12.840 --> 07:16.320
have your connectivity back, hopefully.

07:16.320 --> 07:21.040
All right, and well, verification is optional.

07:21.040 --> 07:29.480
But personally I like it a lot because what it does is NMS state gets the desired state

07:29.480 --> 07:35.600
from the user, then apply it, and then get the current state that is applied to the system

07:35.600 --> 07:36.880
and compare them.

07:36.880 --> 07:41.600
And if they are not equals, then it's going to fail and it's going to rollback to the

07:41.600 --> 07:42.600
previous state automatically.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.320
That is great because sometimes you don't know about some options and there are some

07:47.320 --> 07:51.920
requirements to set up these options on interface.

07:51.920 --> 07:58.800
So what you can do is apply this if it goes wrong because kernel is not applying the option

07:58.800 --> 08:01.960
correctly because they are incompatible, for example.

08:01.960 --> 08:07.120
So it does a rollback automatically and you don't end up with a wrong configure interface.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.000
But you can skip this using dash dash no verify.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.600
Okay, so let's see some examples of YAML files.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.520
These are a little bit simple but I think they are great examples.

08:19.520 --> 08:28.040
Here, for example, we have a bond interface and you can just define the state, IPv4, the

08:28.040 --> 08:33.320
link aggregation options, you can define the mode, the options of that mode, and then define

08:33.320 --> 08:34.320
the board.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.480
And one thing that is really, really useful is that we have partial editing.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.880
So imagine that you want to change only the MAC address but you don't want to change the

08:40.880 --> 08:41.880
IP address.

08:41.880 --> 08:48.000
You don't need to define the IP address because you just define the interface and the type.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.160
So this is just enough.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.680
Then the MAC address and apply the state.

08:52.680 --> 08:57.120
An NMS state will get the current status of the interface and will merge.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.720
So you won't lose any property.

08:59.720 --> 09:05.640
All right, so then we have, for example, another example in the middle is the Abilang interface

09:05.640 --> 09:12.160
over adh1 interface and another great thing here, as I say, is that NMS state will solve

09:12.160 --> 09:14.400
interdependencies automatically.

09:14.400 --> 09:20.560
So basically you don't need to know if, in which state needs to be the adh1 when creating

09:20.560 --> 09:22.600
the Abilang, needs to be up or down.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
It doesn't matter.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.400
We are going to handle it.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.120
So you don't need to worry about it.

09:28.120 --> 09:33.720
And then, for example, we have a Linux switch with the port and some options on the port.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.280
And also one great thing here is that you don't need to care about the state of the

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
port.

09:38.280 --> 09:43.120
NMS state will solve the dependencies and will bring the port up if needed or will configure

09:43.120 --> 09:46.360
as needed.

09:46.360 --> 09:52.760
Some more examples because, as I say, NMS state is not only focused on interfaces.

09:52.760 --> 10:02.200
It's also focused on DNS, root configuration, and also some other interfaces like OBS and

10:02.200 --> 10:03.960
OBS dpdk.

10:03.960 --> 10:09.440
So for example, here we have our interface adh1 configure with a static IP address.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.040
And then we have the adroot.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.840
So you can define adroot and it will be applied to KANA.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.440
The same for root in policy.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.700
It's also supported.

10:18.700 --> 10:22.120
You can define from IP2 and IP4.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.600
It will be for one mask.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.080
It will be applied.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.080
The same thing for DNS solver.

10:29.080 --> 10:35.560
As you can see there, the last example, it's an OBS interface with an OBS reach.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
So you can define it.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.140
And then the great thing is that you don't need always to define the OBS interface.

10:40.140 --> 10:45.320
You can define only the OBS reach and add ports or delete ports from it.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.920
So it's quite great.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.200
All right.

10:49.200 --> 10:53.880
So having seen these examples, I would like to do a demo.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
Sorry if it doesn't work.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.360
I hope it will.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.920
I have an environment.

10:57.920 --> 11:03.960
So let's try it out.

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
All right.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
So it's big enough.

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
I can make it bigger.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
Yeah?

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
Okay.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.960
Right.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.960
So okay.

11:10.960 --> 11:17.600
I'm using the main branch belchion, which is 2.2.6.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.080
And here we have, this is really great.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.640
We have an example base.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.880
So you can, if you are learning how to use nmsday, this is quite good.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.760
You can go here and see different examples of how you should do it.

11:32.760 --> 11:42.440
So one that is really simple is, for example, this one.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.440
Right.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.640
So this one, one similar to what I showed before.

11:48.640 --> 11:56.400
So this is an adh1, and then you have the config, a root config for the adh1.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.360
So let's check before the state that we have already.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
Okay.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.520
This is the IP address that we have.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.520
Here we have adh1.

12:04.520 --> 12:10.140
adh1 is a base, but it's defined as an definite.

12:10.140 --> 12:13.800
So according to us, it will behave as an definite.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.400
So let's apply the state.

12:16.400 --> 12:25.520
This, set the attachment and add root.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.520
That's it.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.520
It's done.

12:27.520 --> 12:33.520
If we go to IPA and we go to adh1, we can see the IP address configured here.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.080
Right.

12:35.080 --> 12:41.920
Then if we do IPR, we are going to see the root here.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.120
One for the IP address and the other one, the root that we set.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.640
And also if you are willing to check what happened in the one manner here, you can do

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
this.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Whoops.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Okay.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
Sorry.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.640
All right.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.880
You can do this.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.400
You will notice that the device is up, and we can check the connection that we generated.

13:05.400 --> 13:12.280
But let's go to a, sorry.

13:12.280 --> 13:15.660
Let's check a more complex sample.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.660
What we need first to clean up the state.

13:17.660 --> 13:20.160
So I'm going to show you how we clean up the state.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.600
We have adh1, then all roots.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
All right.

13:25.600 --> 13:32.000
So here, for example, we just need to define the adh1 and then define the roots with the

13:32.000 --> 13:34.680
nethup interface and state absent.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.080
And this will clear all the roots that are defined for that interface, which is very

13:39.080 --> 13:42.200
great because when removing something, you don't need to define everything.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.320
You just need to define the properties that you want to match and then state absent, and

13:47.320 --> 13:50.320
it will clear them.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.640
All right.

13:55.640 --> 14:02.680
That's fine.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.200
So it's applied.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.360
Let's check it.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
Okay.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.880
And then we can, oh, it's active.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.560
Right, because we didn't bring down the adh1 interface.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.160
That's fine, but we dropped the root.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.720
So let's create a more complex one.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.240
One that I especially like.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
It's this one.

14:22.240 --> 14:27.540
This is going to be the last one.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.920
So here we are going to define this.

14:30.920 --> 14:36.920
We have two Ethernet interfaces that are connected to a boy interface, which has also another

14:36.920 --> 14:42.080
port which is going to be a bridge and a B-land over another bridge.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.080
So all right.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.080
This is the state.

14:45.080 --> 14:51.240
We define the B-land interfaces with the IV, the Linux bridge, which the board is the B-land,

14:51.240 --> 14:56.680
and then another Linux bridge up, and the board is going to be the bond.

14:56.680 --> 15:03.120
And then for the bond, we have the two Ethernet interfaces, adh1 and adh2, and we have adh1

15:03.120 --> 15:05.000
and adh2 defined.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
So let's apply it.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
All right.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.720
This will do a little bit more.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.280
That's fine.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
Right.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.800
So in the board manager, everything seems set.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.240
Then we can do IPA.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.760
Plenty of things.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.680
Let me, this is the B-land.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.280
Then we have here the bond with the other's configure.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.600
No, sorry.

15:36.600 --> 15:41.560
We have the bond here and the bridge, 29.

15:41.560 --> 15:47.320
We can also remove them as we did with the other example.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.720
And let me show you how it looks.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.720
Right.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.400
So this is quite simple.

15:52.400 --> 15:57.760
You just need to define adh1, adh2 as down because adh1 is an Ethernet.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.640
It's a, well, it's a mutlating Ethernet, but it's a physical device.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.880
So you cannot remove it completely.

16:04.880 --> 16:12.120
And then you have the bond, which can be dropped, the bridge, the B-land, and the other bridge.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.280
So that's it.

16:14.280 --> 16:20.840
If you apply it, it will be gone.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.360
Check.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
All right.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.360
So it should be done.

16:25.360 --> 16:30.000
But first, as you can see, they are not anymore.

16:30.000 --> 16:38.200
You cannot see any more of the link, nor the roots, nor the connections because we didn't,

16:38.200 --> 16:42.520
we removed also the network manager connection files.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.520
So I think that's it.

16:43.520 --> 16:48.440
It was a little bit, a little demo about how it works.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.960
I really encourage you to try it out.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.960
It's really simple.

16:51.960 --> 16:57.200
If you're already using network manager, you basically do not need to do anything else

16:57.200 --> 17:01.360
because installing NMS state will be enough.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.960
NMS state is packaged basically on Fedora, CentOS, and rel.

17:05.960 --> 17:15.520
And, well, if you use the Rust library, you can also use the create to use it whenever

17:15.520 --> 17:16.520
you want.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.840
All right.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.120
So that will be all.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.920
And now some questions.

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
Thank you.

17:23.920 --> 17:38.360
So you basically use network manager to do all the settings and everything.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.760
But you also use Netlink.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.040
Why is it necessary?

17:44.040 --> 17:46.360
Don't you get all the information from network manager?

17:46.360 --> 17:47.360
No.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.720
Because Nebo Manajer is not getting real-time information from Kana all the time.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.240
He's not updating it directly.

17:53.240 --> 17:58.040
If you look to the devices, the devices doesn't have all the properties.

17:58.040 --> 18:03.120
And in Nispo, we care about all the properties that are defined on Kana.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
So this is the main reason.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.040
Are there settings that you need to do the Netlink as well?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.040
No, no.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.160
We don't do the settings through Netlink.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.760
We just get them to compare.

18:11.760 --> 18:18.480
We found out the problem that as network manager is a service and is listening on events of

18:18.480 --> 18:24.720
Netlink, sometimes takes some time to update the device cache.

18:24.720 --> 18:28.840
And that's a problem because when you do an operation, you want the result immediately.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.000
Isn't that the bug in network manager?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Well, it isn't.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.720
In the end, you have a very good cache.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.840
And it's hard to keep everything updated.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.640
So they perform a lot of operations.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.600
Obviously, it could be improved.

18:42.600 --> 18:47.720
But right now, this is the solution that we thought about.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.560
Nispo can apply settings to Kana, but we don't use it on NMS.

18:52.560 --> 18:57.480
This is like an extra feature that we work on it from time to time.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.480
Hello.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.800
I would like to ask if dummy interfaces are supported?

19:01.800 --> 19:05.280
And if not, are they planned to be supported?

19:05.280 --> 19:06.280
Dummy interfaces?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.280
Yes.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.280
Dummy interfaces are supported.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
And that's it.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.720
You can check the documentation.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.280
I think everything is supported for them.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.080
Thank you.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.400
Any more questions?

19:19.400 --> 19:22.720
All right.

19:22.720 --> 19:28.360
I think we're good.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.360
Yeah, we are good.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.360
Thank you very much.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.360
Thank you very much for attending.

19:32.360 --> 19:46.800
Thank you very much.
