1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.680
Great, yeah, sorry for the old, the usual, I'm sure you're used to it now.

2
0:00:11.680 --> 0:00:14.000
Great to see so many people here, amazing.

3
0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:16.640
Thanks for your interest in the Co-op Cloud.

4
0:00:16.640 --> 0:00:24.280
Yeah, I'm decentralized, that's my internet name, and these are my enterprise slides

5
0:00:24.280 --> 0:00:25.440
for the Co-op Cloud.

6
0:00:25.440 --> 0:00:32.800
So I've been working on this project now for, yeah, maybe two to three years, I would say,

7
0:00:32.800 --> 0:00:40.160
so there's a lot of knowledge of the project, how it happened, and what came to pass, locked

8
0:00:40.160 --> 0:00:46.560
up in my head, but I am only one person involved in this project, which has now become quite

9
0:00:46.560 --> 0:00:50.080
a wonderful project, I would say, which involves a lot of different collectors, a lot of different

10
0:00:50.080 --> 0:00:51.080
groups.

11
0:00:51.080 --> 0:00:55.140
So yeah, this is just kind of like a moment to offload what we've been up to for the last

12
0:00:55.140 --> 0:01:02.760
two years, and yeah, all the hot takes are mine, mine alone.

13
0:01:02.760 --> 0:01:08.360
Some of the images are taken from, yeah, shout out to fellow worker Trav, the internet gardening

14
0:01:08.360 --> 0:01:15.080
collection on Arena, I totally recommend checking that out, it's great.

15
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:22.200
So yeah, Co-op Cloud, this is the official website ready description of what the Co-op

16
0:01:22.200 --> 0:01:26.720
Cloud is, a software stack that aims to make hosting Libra software applications simple

17
0:01:26.720 --> 0:01:31.240
for small service providers, such as tech co-ops who are looking to standardize around

18
0:01:31.240 --> 0:01:37.440
open transparent and scalable infrastructure, which is a lot.

19
0:01:37.440 --> 0:01:40.160
So I was thinking, how am I going to explain this?

20
0:01:40.160 --> 0:01:43.800
Because we come straight in with a software stack, but actually it's much more than that.

21
0:01:43.800 --> 0:01:49.560
I think you could argue our project is more a social endeavor, social organizing, more

22
0:01:49.560 --> 0:01:53.140
than a technical thing, but of course they're overlapping.

23
0:01:53.140 --> 0:02:00.160
So I thought, well, okay, we'll just go back, we'll do a history lesson on how the project

24
0:02:00.160 --> 0:02:01.160
started.

25
0:02:01.160 --> 0:02:08.360
And I feel like that is an important angle for introducing the project, so I want you

26
0:02:08.360 --> 0:02:12.880
to understand where the project is coming from, and then maybe you feel welcome to join

27
0:02:12.880 --> 0:02:17.200
the project and shape the future of the project.

28
0:02:17.200 --> 0:02:23.120
And I think this historical view on where things are coming helps to ground the project

29
0:02:23.120 --> 0:02:26.680
in an actual need, human need.

30
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:31.400
There's a lot of software projects out there that are just like, why does this exist?

31
0:02:31.400 --> 0:02:38.240
But we're trying to show that this is socially useful, and why we have come up with this

32
0:02:38.240 --> 0:02:45.960
project and initiated and tried to make it work is based on what we needed at the time.

33
0:02:45.960 --> 0:02:50.440
But that may necessarily be the case in the future.

34
0:02:50.440 --> 0:02:56.800
So yeah, put that to one side, and let me introduce you to the magic brain of autonomic

35
0:02:56.800 --> 0:02:58.520
co-op.

36
0:02:58.520 --> 0:03:00.360
So these are some people in the co-op.

37
0:03:00.360 --> 0:03:03.140
There's me on the banjo.

38
0:03:03.140 --> 0:03:04.140
That's not all of them.

39
0:03:04.140 --> 0:03:07.200
There's 13 of us, as far as I remember.

40
0:03:07.200 --> 0:03:10.680
We have a new website that was just put up last night, so check it out.

41
0:03:10.680 --> 0:03:11.680
It's hilarious.

42
0:03:11.680 --> 0:03:16.560
I don't know if I can get up here, but I'll try maybe at some point.

43
0:03:16.560 --> 0:03:20.280
So yeah, we're a technology cooperative, a worker-owned cooperative.

44
0:03:20.280 --> 0:03:22.840
That means the people who work in the business own the business.

45
0:03:22.840 --> 0:03:26.400
It's run and managed by ourselves.

46
0:03:26.400 --> 0:03:32.940
And that means we're, yeah, this is like a, you know, when we come into where we work,

47
0:03:32.940 --> 0:03:37.560
we have the chance to make decisions about every aspect of how the workplace runs.

48
0:03:37.560 --> 0:03:40.040
So you know, what kind of work do we want to do?

49
0:03:40.040 --> 0:03:43.040
How do we want to make decisions?

50
0:03:43.040 --> 0:03:44.120
How do we deal with money?

51
0:03:44.120 --> 0:03:46.240
How do we find the new work?

52
0:03:46.240 --> 0:03:48.660
Who do we want to work with?

53
0:03:48.660 --> 0:03:52.200
Another member wants to work with this group, but someone else disagrees with that.

54
0:03:52.200 --> 0:03:53.200
How do we work this out?

55
0:03:53.200 --> 0:03:55.440
How do we deal with conflict?

56
0:03:55.440 --> 0:04:03.080
It's kind of an end-to-end workplace situation where you have the chance to, you know, be

57
0:04:03.080 --> 0:04:05.040
involved in every step of the process.

58
0:04:05.040 --> 0:04:08.400
And of course, you don't have to do that alone.

59
0:04:08.400 --> 0:04:10.040
You can do that with your friends.

60
0:04:10.040 --> 0:04:14.000
So that's the kind of model of the cooperative.

61
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:25.840
Yeah, and one of the kind of, yeah, I'll come back to the website maybe in a bit.

62
0:04:25.840 --> 0:04:34.760
So one of the ideas behind what a cooperative is, is this listing of cooperative principles.

63
0:04:34.760 --> 0:04:38.160
You can see them on the right-hand side there.

64
0:04:38.160 --> 0:04:43.560
For example, autonomy, independence, you know, economic participation of the members, open

65
0:04:43.560 --> 0:04:44.880
voluntary membership.

66
0:04:44.880 --> 0:04:48.700
These are kind of like non-binding principles of what it means to be a co-op.

67
0:04:48.700 --> 0:04:52.200
Principle six, for example, that you will work with other co-ops.

68
0:04:52.200 --> 0:04:57.440
So you know, we want to expand cooperation in the ecosystem of groups that are trying

69
0:04:57.440 --> 0:05:00.640
to do this as well.

70
0:05:00.640 --> 0:05:09.600
And a lot of these hinge on actually having money to survive in order to practice what

71
0:05:09.600 --> 0:05:11.880
it means to be a cooperative.

72
0:05:11.880 --> 0:05:16.480
So we are a technology cooperative, and what do we do exactly?

73
0:05:16.480 --> 0:05:20.480
And you could kind of say we do basically everything and anything.

74
0:05:20.480 --> 0:05:24.280
Like we would happily develop a new piece of software, but we'd also come to your house

75
0:05:24.280 --> 0:05:27.080
and fix your toaster.

76
0:05:27.080 --> 0:05:32.120
We try to work with people that we want to work with, that we want to support, that we

77
0:05:32.120 --> 0:05:36.840
like their work, or that connect with our values.

78
0:05:36.840 --> 0:05:41.720
And one of the things we've done quite successfully, in my opinion, is to run a free software stack

79
0:05:41.720 --> 0:05:45.520
boat internally and for the people we work with.

80
0:05:45.520 --> 0:05:51.000
So we have like all the things we use, our free software.

81
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:57.120
So we're pretty good at that, managing our own internal infrastructure.

82
0:05:57.120 --> 0:06:00.200
And so necessarily we would then just offer that to groups.

83
0:06:00.200 --> 0:06:02.220
Like do you want a website?

84
0:06:02.220 --> 0:06:04.600
Do you want your own chat system, like a matrix?

85
0:06:04.600 --> 0:06:06.200
Or do you want a wiki?

86
0:06:06.200 --> 0:06:07.600
Or do you want an xCloud or whatever?

87
0:06:07.600 --> 0:06:11.960
This kind of stuff, this classic hosting situation.

88
0:06:11.960 --> 0:06:17.080
And one of these problems that has come up, Autonautics is running like several years

89
0:06:17.080 --> 0:06:24.120
now, five years or so, is that it's difficult to make money when you just do hosting.

90
0:06:24.120 --> 0:06:28.360
People are used to just getting stuff for free, for very understandable reasons.

91
0:06:28.360 --> 0:06:30.600
Big tech.

92
0:06:30.600 --> 0:06:33.920
And at some point, we want to scale out of the code.

93
0:06:33.920 --> 0:06:35.200
We want to involve more people.

94
0:06:35.200 --> 0:06:37.200
We want to be able to make a living from it.

95
0:06:37.200 --> 0:06:40.840
We want to be able to survive, pay the rent, and so on.

96
0:06:40.840 --> 0:06:45.040
And then we started realizing that, OK, actually we're making more money, or people are happy

97
0:06:45.040 --> 0:06:47.640
to pay us more when we are doing support.

98
0:06:47.640 --> 0:06:54.320
And this is talking to people, getting on a call and being like, what is software?

99
0:06:54.320 --> 0:06:55.600
And then talking about it.

100
0:06:55.600 --> 0:06:57.000
Or what is a wiki?

101
0:06:57.000 --> 0:06:58.000
Everyone's saying wiki.

102
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:00.360
I don't know what a wiki is.

103
0:07:00.360 --> 0:07:01.960
And just having a chat about it.

104
0:07:01.960 --> 0:07:05.200
But then also being around later.

105
0:07:05.200 --> 0:07:11.280
So once they ask for the thing, like an xCloud, you set it up and then you don't disappear

106
0:07:11.280 --> 0:07:15.400
because you're a cooperative and you intend to continue.

107
0:07:15.400 --> 0:07:17.520
So sustainability is one of the core principles.

108
0:07:17.520 --> 0:07:19.760
So we stick with them.

109
0:07:19.760 --> 0:07:20.760
We chat.

110
0:07:20.760 --> 0:07:23.680
We're contact on mail and so on.

111
0:07:23.680 --> 0:07:30.160
So this is kind of the dilemma of like, we want to definitely do more hosting because

112
0:07:30.160 --> 0:07:32.720
people need digital infrastructure to do their work.

113
0:07:32.720 --> 0:07:37.560
This is just like a base layer of how to organize things.

114
0:07:37.560 --> 0:07:39.600
But it's difficult to survive.

115
0:07:39.600 --> 0:07:41.960
As a technology cooperative, only doing hosting.

116
0:07:41.960 --> 0:07:47.280
So you need to expand what you do.

117
0:07:47.280 --> 0:07:54.120
And one of the places we ended up was using Cloudron, which is a kind of like one-click

118
0:07:54.120 --> 0:07:58.800
install open source system, which I would still recommend.

119
0:07:58.800 --> 0:07:59.800
It's great.

120
0:07:59.800 --> 0:08:00.800
It got us really far.

121
0:08:00.800 --> 0:08:02.840
A lot of the next slides criticize it.

122
0:08:02.840 --> 0:08:07.880
So I'm just going to say it's great on this slide.

123
0:08:07.880 --> 0:08:13.520
So you can see you have your classic selection of open source apps if you're familiar with

124
0:08:13.520 --> 0:08:14.520
that stuff.

125
0:08:14.520 --> 0:08:19.960
Like RockaChat, for example, we use RockaChat to communicate in the co-op.

126
0:08:19.960 --> 0:08:28.600
And what this enabled us to do was basically work with different groups that may not necessarily

127
0:08:28.600 --> 0:08:36.800
have money to support us, like to make it sustainable to work with them, but still support

128
0:08:36.800 --> 0:08:38.240
them to do their work.

129
0:08:38.240 --> 0:08:41.720
And Cloudron was like a really kind of like get out of jail card in that sense.

130
0:08:41.720 --> 0:08:46.200
It was like, okay, I can just like hit five times on this WordPress button.

131
0:08:46.200 --> 0:08:47.680
And we've got five WordPress sites.

132
0:08:47.680 --> 0:08:48.680
And people are going.

133
0:08:48.680 --> 0:08:49.680
They're posting.

134
0:08:49.680 --> 0:08:50.680
They're organizing.

135
0:08:50.680 --> 0:08:51.680
They're working.

136
0:08:51.680 --> 0:08:52.680
We're supporting them.

137
0:08:52.680 --> 0:08:53.680
It's brilliant.

138
0:08:53.680 --> 0:09:00.280
And for those that don't know, Cloudron is just like you fire up a server, you SSH into

139
0:09:00.280 --> 0:09:05.360
it, you run a command, it spins up this thing, and you're going.

140
0:09:05.360 --> 0:09:08.640
You can install multiple apps on the same server.

141
0:09:08.640 --> 0:09:13.280
So this really reduces the costs for rolling out digital infrastructure.

142
0:09:13.280 --> 0:09:18.640
Let me check time, sorry.

143
0:09:18.640 --> 0:09:19.640
Yes.

144
0:09:19.640 --> 0:09:20.640
All right.

145
0:09:20.640 --> 0:09:25.800
So yeah, remember I said that Cloudron is cool.

146
0:09:25.800 --> 0:09:34.680
But at some point, the core of the part, the front end, the web front end became proprietary.

147
0:09:34.680 --> 0:09:35.680
So they made a switch.

148
0:09:35.680 --> 0:09:39.480
In some sense, I can't blame them because, as I said, if you want to survive, you need

149
0:09:39.480 --> 0:09:42.800
to make a book, and you need to pay the rent and so on.

150
0:09:42.800 --> 0:09:45.880
But yeah, that made us nervous.

151
0:09:45.880 --> 0:09:50.840
When we work with people as a cooperative, we want to say we'll be around for you.

152
0:09:50.840 --> 0:09:51.840
We want to continue.

153
0:09:51.840 --> 0:09:54.560
We want to do this sustainably.

154
0:09:54.560 --> 0:09:59.320
And if you remember, one of the principles is like our independence.

155
0:09:59.320 --> 0:10:01.200
Can we exist in this world?

156
0:10:01.200 --> 0:10:05.920
There's, of course, interdependencies, but can we continue to do what we want to do

157
0:10:05.920 --> 0:10:09.960
without relying on one specific thing?

158
0:10:09.960 --> 0:10:15.280
So when Cloudron made the decision to make the front end proprietary, you can still use

159
0:10:15.280 --> 0:10:16.280
it, whatever.

160
0:10:16.280 --> 0:10:17.280
It's a great system.

161
0:10:17.280 --> 0:10:23.960
But we thought, oh no, what's going to happen?

162
0:10:23.960 --> 0:10:27.440
And then we started looking a bit deeper.

163
0:10:27.440 --> 0:10:35.920
And we realized that Cloudron, when you click and install an app, the apps are...

164
0:10:35.920 --> 0:10:38.320
Yeah, it's an image.

165
0:10:38.320 --> 0:10:40.680
So it uses a container system.

166
0:10:40.680 --> 0:10:43.400
It's kind of like a light virtualization layer.

167
0:10:43.400 --> 0:10:47.440
They're packaging all the apps themselves.

168
0:10:47.440 --> 0:10:52.400
So the people who work in Cloudron, Inc., or whatever, when they want to provide a new

169
0:10:52.400 --> 0:10:59.360
app, they say, okay, let's make a new Git repository and let's package this thing.

170
0:10:59.360 --> 0:11:01.540
And that's great, and it works really well.

171
0:11:01.540 --> 0:11:04.640
But then we realized that they had packaged...

172
0:11:04.640 --> 0:11:09.200
I can't remember specific apps, but take, for example, Nextcloud.

173
0:11:09.200 --> 0:11:12.360
They had gone, and some worker in Cloudron had packaged Nextcloud.

174
0:11:12.360 --> 0:11:15.920
But then we went to the upstream Nextcloud repository, and we saw they had provided an

175
0:11:15.920 --> 0:11:16.960
image.

176
0:11:16.960 --> 0:11:20.680
And then we thought, well, why aren't we just working with them?

177
0:11:20.680 --> 0:11:24.920
Because that would connect our values with expanding cooperation in different layers

178
0:11:24.920 --> 0:11:28.640
of the software stack and so on.

179
0:11:28.640 --> 0:11:33.160
And then the more we looked, we realized that free software communities were really converging

180
0:11:33.160 --> 0:11:37.920
on the idea that you have a packaged image inside your repository.

181
0:11:37.920 --> 0:11:41.960
So you're hacking on your source code, and you just have an image that's building.

182
0:11:41.960 --> 0:11:43.320
And we can use that.

183
0:11:43.320 --> 0:11:44.740
That's what Cloudron needs.

184
0:11:44.740 --> 0:11:46.560
So we were like, okay, that's interesting.

185
0:11:46.560 --> 0:11:49.960
Maybe let's think about that.

186
0:11:49.960 --> 0:12:01.320
And then the logical end of the paranoia or whatever was that we were relying on this one

187
0:12:01.320 --> 0:12:07.800
company, this one group.

188
0:12:07.800 --> 0:12:15.400
Autonomic is a cooperative that supports maybe 20-plus groups, but a large selection of them

189
0:12:15.400 --> 0:12:19.120
have very little money to pay for the infrastructure.

190
0:12:19.120 --> 0:12:23.800
So if you could imagine that Cloudron would somehow make a bigger step into more proprietary

191
0:12:23.800 --> 0:12:29.100
solutions or somehow increase the cost or who knows what, we'd be in a position where

192
0:12:29.100 --> 0:12:31.640
we can support those groups.

193
0:12:31.640 --> 0:12:34.680
And that's not something we wanted to deal with.

194
0:12:34.680 --> 0:12:41.760
So we started to try to think, like, you know, where do we make this better or whatever?

195
0:12:41.760 --> 0:12:44.960
And that is the start of Cloud.

196
0:12:44.960 --> 0:12:51.240
So now we're getting back into another take on that original really long sentence that

197
0:12:51.240 --> 0:12:54.360
had things like software stack in it.

198
0:12:54.360 --> 0:13:02.160
Yeah, we were like, let's just eliminate this issue of proprietary angles or whatever.

199
0:13:02.160 --> 0:13:06.480
Oh, yeah, here's where I just couldn't get the emoji in the slide, so I just gave up.

200
0:13:06.480 --> 0:13:10.540
Yeah, we were just like, we'll just copy left the entire thing.

201
0:13:10.540 --> 0:13:11.540
Let's just do that.

202
0:13:11.540 --> 0:13:13.040
That seems sensible.

203
0:13:13.040 --> 0:13:14.040
Cool.

204
0:13:14.040 --> 0:13:22.600
And then, as I mentioned, Yee Ha, Terrell, favorite emoji, we want to work with the upstream

205
0:13:22.600 --> 0:13:29.960
developers of the software because a lot of precarity is in the open source ecosystem

206
0:13:29.960 --> 0:13:35.000
in that there's, you know, certain developers which are doing unpaid labor to develop the

207
0:13:35.000 --> 0:13:39.000
software that a lot of us rely on.

208
0:13:39.000 --> 0:13:41.880
And they're providing these, you know, a lot of them are providing these packages.

209
0:13:41.880 --> 0:13:47.680
And we thought, well, OK, we can just meet them where they're at, engage with them on

210
0:13:47.680 --> 0:13:55.360
the issue tracker, you know, speak to them, make them aware of our hosting efforts.

211
0:13:55.360 --> 0:14:02.000
And you know, we're in a sense like closer to end users in that, you know, it's like

212
0:14:02.000 --> 0:14:08.280
developers, hosters, users, you know, summarized.

213
0:14:08.280 --> 0:14:11.960
And often developers, well, they've got their hands full trying to make the software work.

214
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:14.480
So we can like help that connection.

215
0:14:14.480 --> 0:14:18.540
So we're trying to bridge that in that sense.

216
0:14:18.540 --> 0:14:25.320
And also, which we'll see later on, they're also providing, so they're packaging up their

217
0:14:25.320 --> 0:14:32.560
apps in images, but they're also providing this kind of extra configuration around it,

218
0:14:32.560 --> 0:14:36.600
which kind of tells you how to deploy the thing, which is great for people who are doing

219
0:14:36.600 --> 0:14:41.280
hosting because, OK, we have an app, but does it need a database, for example?

220
0:14:41.280 --> 0:14:43.600
So what database?

221
0:14:43.600 --> 0:14:45.440
But they're also doing that for us as well.

222
0:14:45.440 --> 0:14:48.880
So if you develop over our software, thank you.

223
0:14:48.880 --> 0:14:50.200
Yeah.

224
0:14:50.200 --> 0:14:54.000
And then the democratic governance.

225
0:14:54.000 --> 0:14:56.520
We were going to initiate this project, let's say.

226
0:14:56.520 --> 0:14:58.720
I wouldn't say we like invented it.

227
0:14:58.720 --> 0:15:01.520
We just like collude a bunch of stuff together.

228
0:15:01.520 --> 0:15:06.240
But we wanted to not be in control of that.

229
0:15:06.240 --> 0:15:13.200
So not become the new Cloud Run, which is like, OK, let's set up some clear rules for

230
0:15:13.200 --> 0:15:15.160
how do you interact with this project?

231
0:15:15.160 --> 0:15:18.120
And also, on what basis?

232
0:15:18.120 --> 0:15:20.100
Are you also a technology cooperative?

233
0:15:20.100 --> 0:15:21.340
Are you a personal developer?

234
0:15:21.340 --> 0:15:22.880
Are you a user of the software?

235
0:15:22.880 --> 0:15:24.320
Do you want to support the host?

236
0:15:24.320 --> 0:15:26.080
Or do you want to support the device?

237
0:15:26.080 --> 0:15:32.640
We can start to engage with it where we're at, but meet in this kind of common project.

238
0:15:32.640 --> 0:15:41.720
And obviously, the goal then is to sustain open source digital infrastructure and expand

239
0:15:41.720 --> 0:15:43.720
cooperation.

240
0:15:43.720 --> 0:15:44.480
Yeah.

241
0:15:44.480 --> 0:15:52.360
So moving out of the history phase and now into what it actually is.

242
0:15:52.360 --> 0:15:53.760
Yes.

243
0:15:53.760 --> 0:16:03.680
So this word kind of pops up if you've checked the website or the docs.

244
0:16:03.680 --> 0:16:05.040
Democratic tech collectives.

245
0:16:05.040 --> 0:16:09.040
So what is that actually?

246
0:16:09.040 --> 0:16:15.360
We are so Autonomic is a more public registered in the UK.

247
0:16:15.360 --> 0:16:16.800
We're publicly regulated.

248
0:16:16.800 --> 0:16:19.520
We're a cooperative society.

249
0:16:19.520 --> 0:16:26.960
We have gone through the paperwork to make that happen because we wanted to do that.

250
0:16:26.960 --> 0:16:33.460
But we recognize that not everyone will want to do that or be able to do that.

251
0:16:33.460 --> 0:16:35.920
And this really depends on a per country basis.

252
0:16:35.920 --> 0:16:39.000
If you're in the Netherlands, it's a different model.

253
0:16:39.000 --> 0:16:45.560
If you're in the UK, the way you relate to the legal system and the state is like, in

254
0:16:45.560 --> 0:16:46.720
Germany, it's quite difficult.

255
0:16:46.720 --> 0:16:49.600
I've been told there's no way to kind of just like slot yourself in.

256
0:16:49.600 --> 0:16:57.600
You're like, yeah, it's not like very easy to find information.

257
0:16:57.600 --> 0:17:02.040
And we don't want that to be a limiting factor in working together.

258
0:17:02.040 --> 0:17:07.000
So we were trying to conceptualize this idea of like what other groups would we be willing

259
0:17:07.000 --> 0:17:13.880
to work with but not close that definition down from the outside.

260
0:17:13.880 --> 0:17:22.200
So we were thinking about other groups who want to work with their friends or together

261
0:17:22.200 --> 0:17:26.280
with other groups and have set up decision making, for example, collective decision making.

262
0:17:26.280 --> 0:17:31.520
So they're able to navigate what they want to do together.

263
0:17:31.520 --> 0:17:33.560
That was kind of like a thing we wanted to do.

264
0:17:33.560 --> 0:17:35.480
We want to be able to interact with each other.

265
0:17:35.480 --> 0:17:41.320
We want to be able to disagree and receive and send constructive feedback, reach, compromise,

266
0:17:41.320 --> 0:17:43.240
stuff like this.

267
0:17:43.240 --> 0:17:48.080
This is kind of easier to do when people are already organized in their own groups.

268
0:17:48.080 --> 0:17:54.600
But yeah, this didn't really rule out individuals who are active in the project at the moment

269
0:17:54.600 --> 0:17:57.600
and also other technology cooperatives.

270
0:17:57.600 --> 0:18:03.480
We're kind of just trying to like saddle through it somehow and be like, just work with us.

271
0:18:03.480 --> 0:18:04.480
Let's figure it out together.

272
0:18:04.480 --> 0:18:11.560
And this has been in progress for some time, the formalization of what this means.

273
0:18:11.560 --> 0:18:18.040
And that's an open process which I would love to invite you to come check out.

274
0:18:18.040 --> 0:18:21.000
The configuration commons.

275
0:18:21.000 --> 0:18:27.160
This is a, so as I said before, we have open source apps that we can package them in images

276
0:18:27.160 --> 0:18:33.420
and then we can specify a configuration around those images to describe how that app should

277
0:18:33.420 --> 0:18:40.120
look like in a deployment on a server live and well, people using it.

278
0:18:40.120 --> 0:18:44.960
And one of the things we noticed was that, as I said before, the configuration that was

279
0:18:44.960 --> 0:18:51.640
being provided by the upstream repositories was useful, but it didn't specify the full

280
0:18:51.640 --> 0:18:56.920
kind of end-to-end production kind of scenario.

281
0:18:56.920 --> 0:19:02.520
And that's kind of a big word, but for example, how to back up the app data.

282
0:19:02.520 --> 0:19:06.040
Like the thing is deployed, people are using it and we need to make sure their data is

283
0:19:06.040 --> 0:19:07.480
safe, so we need to back it up.

284
0:19:07.480 --> 0:19:08.480
How do we back the thing up?

285
0:19:08.480 --> 0:19:09.480
How do we restore it?

286
0:19:09.480 --> 0:19:15.360
This is kind of like a step from it works to it works and it's safe for these people

287
0:19:15.360 --> 0:19:16.560
to use it.

288
0:19:16.560 --> 0:19:23.640
And we wanted to encapsulate that into our configuration.

289
0:19:23.640 --> 0:19:24.640
So this is a big part of it.

290
0:19:24.640 --> 0:19:27.360
We'll go through each one of these deeper.

291
0:19:27.360 --> 0:19:29.320
I'm just going to overview them now.

292
0:19:29.320 --> 0:19:34.280
Yeah, Abra is a command line tool, so our own digital tools, we wanted to be involved

293
0:19:34.280 --> 0:19:39.960
in how the tools are shaped and how we use them.

294
0:19:39.960 --> 0:19:44.320
That's a great situation where you're dog-fooding your own system with your peers and you're

295
0:19:44.320 --> 0:19:48.480
trying to figure out how does this best suit us.

296
0:19:48.480 --> 0:19:55.280
And according to our own constraints, we can't spend all day learning this obscure system

297
0:19:55.280 --> 0:19:59.920
or we can't invest too much time in some things.

298
0:19:59.920 --> 0:20:06.960
So we need to cut corners and it's best to be involved directly in that process.

299
0:20:06.960 --> 0:20:11.240
And if we remember back to Cloudron again, sorry, I'm not going to be bashing them at

300
0:20:11.240 --> 0:20:15.320
all, but yeah, like how do we interact with the system?

301
0:20:15.320 --> 0:20:20.280
In the case of Cloudron, it was a web front end.

302
0:20:20.280 --> 0:20:27.680
But if we're talking about interacting with technology cooperatives and other tech collectives,

303
0:20:27.680 --> 0:20:31.480
there's kind of a difference to begin with because Cloudron is maybe trying to provide

304
0:20:31.480 --> 0:20:35.840
for the, say, let's say, non-technical user or someone who can just kind of get in, click

305
0:20:35.840 --> 0:20:37.760
a few buttons or whatever.

306
0:20:37.760 --> 0:20:44.560
But we're already dealing with groups that are actively deeply involved with Linux system

307
0:20:44.560 --> 0:20:45.800
administration and so on.

308
0:20:45.800 --> 0:20:48.480
So do we need a front end?

309
0:20:48.480 --> 0:20:56.720
So those are the kind of questions we can ask and answer them ourselves in those moments.

310
0:20:56.720 --> 0:21:04.240
And the collective infrastructure, so there's a lot that goes on in between getting an app

311
0:21:04.240 --> 0:21:07.600
out and someone using it.

312
0:21:07.600 --> 0:21:11.320
People have to meet each other and talk and who are you and what's going on and what do

313
0:21:11.320 --> 0:21:13.480
you do and all this kind of stuff.

314
0:21:13.480 --> 0:21:17.160
And then money, where does the money go?

315
0:21:17.160 --> 0:21:18.800
What do you charge?

316
0:21:18.800 --> 0:21:22.520
It's just this end to end, all the social processes that go in and around that.

317
0:21:22.520 --> 0:21:26.600
We wanted to build those up too because that is a huge problem when you're starting off

318
0:21:26.600 --> 0:21:30.040
as a collective and you're like, oh no, where's my bank account?

319
0:21:30.040 --> 0:21:31.040
Like how do I get a bank account?

320
0:21:31.040 --> 0:21:36.840
And you can see Open Collective, for example, doing this, just like mutualizing this financial

321
0:21:36.840 --> 0:21:40.440
infrastructure and just getting people going.

322
0:21:40.440 --> 0:21:50.000
So yeah, docs, Git hosting, getting off GitHub, that's cool, stuff like that.

323
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:56.000
So I'm going to go through these a bit deeper.

324
0:21:56.000 --> 0:22:04.800
We're trying to form, so our proposal at the moment as autonomic, which is, yeah, now I

325
0:22:04.800 --> 0:22:08.400
can say the sentence and I hope it's a bit clearer.

326
0:22:08.400 --> 0:22:12.400
We initiated this project and we're deeply embedded inside it, but we're attempting to

327
0:22:12.400 --> 0:22:18.880
step out of the project and reenter on an equal basis with other collectives.

328
0:22:18.880 --> 0:22:24.160
So in order to do that, we're proposing a federation model, which is based on a great

329
0:22:24.160 --> 0:22:28.800
project called Co-op Cycle, if you've heard about.

330
0:22:28.800 --> 0:22:31.840
But basically different groups can interact with each other.

331
0:22:31.840 --> 0:22:36.600
There will be democratic decision making and some laws and we'll come up with a constitution

332
0:22:36.600 --> 0:22:39.480
together and all this kind of stuff.

333
0:22:39.480 --> 0:22:42.280
I couldn't fit in on this line, but it's not just chaotic nerds.

334
0:22:42.280 --> 0:22:51.680
It's also open to, we can imagine the people who are using the software grouping together

335
0:22:51.680 --> 0:22:57.240
and joining our federation as well to say, hey, this button should be over there.

336
0:22:57.240 --> 0:22:58.800
Could you just fix that?

337
0:22:58.800 --> 0:23:03.800
But in a more collective sense, we could be gathering money, we could be figuring out

338
0:23:03.800 --> 0:23:05.960
how to improve things.

339
0:23:05.960 --> 0:23:09.880
You don't have to be able to just write software to join this kind of stuff.

340
0:23:09.880 --> 0:23:20.300
We could be connecting the different struggles to build up a better open source ecosystem.

341
0:23:20.300 --> 0:23:24.720
So this is a process that's going on right now.

342
0:23:24.720 --> 0:23:26.240
There's invites going out.

343
0:23:26.240 --> 0:23:28.420
We have a new round of private funding.

344
0:23:28.420 --> 0:23:29.920
Thank you, Private Funders.

345
0:23:29.920 --> 0:23:32.680
And yeah, there'll be more news.

346
0:23:32.680 --> 0:23:34.360
But check the website if you're interested in this.

347
0:23:34.360 --> 0:23:40.680
If you're also part of a collective, love to hear from you.

348
0:23:40.680 --> 0:23:46.240
This is a massive problem that we, of course, experience as being six-admins.

349
0:23:46.240 --> 0:23:53.040
And we've seen a lot of people join in on the old Matrix channels and that would be

350
0:23:53.040 --> 0:23:59.160
one person setting up a few apps for friends, family, maybe their local community, a food

351
0:23:59.160 --> 0:24:01.080
co-op, what have you.

352
0:24:01.080 --> 0:24:04.920
And then a few months down the line, it's completely overwhelming.

353
0:24:04.920 --> 0:24:09.200
The email broke, or it doesn't do this, or who knows what.

354
0:24:09.200 --> 0:24:13.400
If you do any sys admin, you'll know the story.

355
0:24:13.400 --> 0:24:19.520
But when you step into the Cloud project, you have this chance to meet your peers who

356
0:24:19.520 --> 0:24:20.680
are also doing this work.

357
0:24:20.680 --> 0:24:25.280
They may not be involved in your project whatsoever, but that's not important.

358
0:24:25.280 --> 0:24:34.760
We have this idea of the config comments that means we can share work on the next Cloud

359
0:24:34.760 --> 0:24:35.760
recipe.

360
0:24:35.760 --> 0:24:36.760
That's what we call them.

361
0:24:36.760 --> 0:24:39.720
We'll come to that in a bit.

362
0:24:39.720 --> 0:24:44.040
So we can work together on the same configuration.

363
0:24:44.040 --> 0:24:48.280
And that means we're sharing tips, tricks, we're talking together.

364
0:24:48.280 --> 0:24:50.240
It's like, this group of users wants this.

365
0:24:50.240 --> 0:24:51.240
Do you want that?

366
0:24:51.240 --> 0:24:52.960
Oh, I tried this.

367
0:24:52.960 --> 0:24:53.960
This kind of stuff.

368
0:24:53.960 --> 0:25:02.400
This has been seen to be a great feature of trying to just open the door for people to

369
0:25:02.400 --> 0:25:05.120
come in and work together.

370
0:25:05.120 --> 0:25:16.760
Because there's a lot of tools that propose reuse and mind share and collective point

371
0:25:16.760 --> 0:25:26.000
of reference, but don't really live up to that, the ideal of reuse.

372
0:25:26.000 --> 0:25:29.120
Just not doing it again, repeating yourself.

373
0:25:29.120 --> 0:25:31.200
So we were conscious of that.

374
0:25:31.200 --> 0:25:34.120
We're trying to work on that.

375
0:25:34.120 --> 0:25:35.380
Focus on training and collaboration.

376
0:25:35.380 --> 0:25:38.880
So we wanted it to be easy to onboard.

377
0:25:38.880 --> 0:25:42.080
We want more democratic tech collectors to pop up.

378
0:25:42.080 --> 0:25:44.840
We want more technology cooperatives to be able to start.

379
0:25:44.840 --> 0:25:49.680
We want people to be able to decide, I want to own and run my own workplace, and I want

380
0:25:49.680 --> 0:25:56.400
to bootstrap some infrastructure for groups I find cool in my city.

381
0:25:56.400 --> 0:25:57.920
And that's what Cloud is about.

382
0:25:57.920 --> 0:26:01.120
It's like a tool set for these people.

383
0:26:01.120 --> 0:26:03.360
It has to be easy to use, of course.

384
0:26:03.360 --> 0:26:05.900
And we're very focused on that public.

385
0:26:05.900 --> 0:26:11.520
So groups who have already decided that that's what they want to do.

386
0:26:11.520 --> 0:26:13.760
They're on the terminal.

387
0:26:13.760 --> 0:26:16.560
At the moment, we only have the terminal clients.

388
0:26:16.560 --> 0:26:18.400
And they're getting into that.

389
0:26:18.400 --> 0:26:23.520
We can't do everything for everyone, but we can definitely, with that public in mind,

390
0:26:23.520 --> 0:26:30.760
we can be focused on how we attempt to make it accessible and usable.

391
0:26:30.760 --> 0:26:32.720
And yes, cooperating with other networks.

392
0:26:32.720 --> 0:26:38.880
So we want to, within our network, of course, we want to have groups join.

393
0:26:38.880 --> 0:26:41.420
But for the groups that don't want to join, we still want to work with them.

394
0:26:41.420 --> 0:26:44.960
If they have the same values, if they're doing similar things, we can also interface with

395
0:26:44.960 --> 0:26:45.960
them.

396
0:26:45.960 --> 0:26:49.720
And we've already seen that happening.

397
0:26:49.720 --> 0:26:51.800
And I'll come back to that in a bit.

398
0:26:51.800 --> 0:26:59.200
But once things are clear and they're getting clear, like we are a group of cooperatives,

399
0:26:59.200 --> 0:27:02.640
we have this configuration commons, we have these tools, we're just specifying what we

400
0:27:02.640 --> 0:27:07.360
are, then it's easier for other groups to say, OK, I understand what is happening here,

401
0:27:07.360 --> 0:27:09.640
and I would like to do this with you.

402
0:27:09.640 --> 0:27:16.960
So there's kind of like a concrete example, find funding together.

403
0:27:16.960 --> 0:27:25.600
So yeah, the conflict commons, yes, the open source apps you love.

404
0:27:25.600 --> 0:27:31.440
It's this catalog of software that is out there, and people are developing the next

405
0:27:31.440 --> 0:27:37.260
cloud, the media wikis, the synapses, the GITI, the whole thing.

406
0:27:37.260 --> 0:27:46.200
So we have quite an expanding conflict commons so that you can deploy a lot of apps.

407
0:27:46.200 --> 0:27:48.200
So that's a thing.

408
0:27:48.200 --> 0:27:52.000
People come to us and they're like, oh, I need a calendar, or I need a note taking app

409
0:27:52.000 --> 0:27:53.000
or an app, or whatever.

410
0:27:53.000 --> 0:27:59.320
And then we're out hunting in the open source ecosystem for apps to add to the catalog.

411
0:27:59.320 --> 0:28:03.120
So that's that.

412
0:28:03.120 --> 0:28:10.040
So to come back to this idea of the image is the app, which is the packaged thing, and

413
0:28:10.040 --> 0:28:15.080
then the kind of wrapper around that, which specifies the end-to-end, kind of how they

414
0:28:15.080 --> 0:28:17.640
should look in production.

415
0:28:17.640 --> 0:28:25.280
And we were conscious to not reinvent a packaging format, and we didn't really know what to

416
0:28:25.280 --> 0:28:33.000
do at that point because we thought, OK, we need to be able to say how, in one file, let's

417
0:28:33.000 --> 0:28:38.000
say, in plain text, a config file, like, here's the app, and how do you back it up?

418
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:39.000
How do you restore it?

419
0:28:39.000 --> 0:28:40.000
How do you take it down?

420
0:28:40.000 --> 0:28:41.000
How do you bring it up?

421
0:28:41.000 --> 0:28:42.000
How do you configure it?

422
0:28:42.000 --> 0:28:43.000
How do you plug it?

423
0:28:43.000 --> 0:28:45.440
This kind of stuff.

424
0:28:45.440 --> 0:28:54.040
And as it turns out, the Docker Compose ecosystem and Docker has kind of been moving towards

425
0:28:54.040 --> 0:28:56.240
the Compose standard they're calling it.

426
0:28:56.240 --> 0:29:01.520
And it's basically, if you've ever seen the Docker Compose file, it's a YAML text file,

427
0:29:01.520 --> 0:29:05.520
and it kind of just specifies what we're looking for.

428
0:29:05.520 --> 0:29:12.320
So we just figured, great, upstream developers are already using this.

429
0:29:12.320 --> 0:29:14.680
This is a developing open standard.

430
0:29:14.680 --> 0:29:16.000
Great.

431
0:29:16.000 --> 0:29:18.680
Let's just build on this.

432
0:29:18.680 --> 0:29:24.040
And I think, as it turns out, that was a good choice and has had many benefits, which we'll

433
0:29:24.040 --> 0:29:25.880
come to on the next slide.

434
0:29:25.880 --> 0:29:26.880
Yeah.

435
0:29:26.880 --> 0:29:32.400
So we're working with upstream developers, and yeah, we're...

436
0:29:32.400 --> 0:29:37.120
So in my background, I've done a lot of configuration management tool, like, for example, working

437
0:29:37.120 --> 0:29:41.680
with Ansible, which was always the grand ideal of reusing roles.

438
0:29:41.680 --> 0:29:51.040
If anyone has used Ansible before, it's kind of like a packaging format for, you know,

439
0:29:51.040 --> 0:29:56.680
you have a server and you want to install, like, Apache on it or something.

440
0:29:56.680 --> 0:29:58.680
And you tell Ansible, install Apache for me.

441
0:29:58.680 --> 0:30:01.240
And then you want to install a new thing.

442
0:30:01.240 --> 0:30:03.920
And then you kind of package this into a role.

443
0:30:03.920 --> 0:30:08.720
And at some point, I realized that everybody is writing the same roles.

444
0:30:08.720 --> 0:30:12.560
It's very difficult to, like, share and to reuse other people's stuff.

445
0:30:12.560 --> 0:30:16.160
It's definitely happening, but not on the scale that I was looking for.

446
0:30:16.160 --> 0:30:18.840
And so I was looking for alternatives.

447
0:30:18.840 --> 0:30:20.880
Yeah.

448
0:30:20.880 --> 0:30:28.000
So in the project so far, we've seen people, like, we have, for example, Matrix Service

449
0:30:28.000 --> 0:30:29.800
Synapse installs.

450
0:30:29.800 --> 0:30:35.840
We've seen multiple collectives look at the config and say, this works for me.

451
0:30:35.840 --> 0:30:37.240
I'm going to use this.

452
0:30:37.240 --> 0:30:41.120
And then changing the config in collaboration with other groups.

453
0:30:41.120 --> 0:30:46.520
So we're already seeing that people are able to make the changes that works for them without

454
0:30:46.520 --> 0:30:48.260
breaking other people's installs.

455
0:30:48.260 --> 0:30:51.600
And then when things need to be worked out, they speak to each other.

456
0:30:51.600 --> 0:30:54.640
And things move along.

457
0:30:54.640 --> 0:31:01.760
And again, the Compose standard really helps here in that it's quite flexible and helps

458
0:31:01.760 --> 0:31:03.560
us.

459
0:31:03.560 --> 0:31:07.240
People can move around each other inside the configuration, which will hopefully become

460
0:31:07.240 --> 0:31:09.240
clear on the next slide.

461
0:31:09.240 --> 0:31:10.240
Yes, great.

462
0:31:10.240 --> 0:31:20.000
We are calling the app configuration a recipe, cooking inspired, and it's a key repository.

463
0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:21.680
Here you have Git.

464
0:31:21.680 --> 0:31:22.680
Git.

465
0:31:22.680 --> 0:31:23.680
Git.

466
0:31:23.680 --> 0:31:24.680
Git.

467
0:31:24.680 --> 0:31:25.680
Git.

468
0:31:25.680 --> 0:31:26.680
Git.

469
0:31:26.680 --> 0:31:27.680
Git.

470
0:31:27.680 --> 0:31:28.680
Git.

471
0:31:28.680 --> 0:31:29.680
Git.

472
0:31:29.680 --> 0:31:30.680
Git.

473
0:31:30.680 --> 0:31:31.680
Git.

474
0:31:31.680 --> 0:31:32.680
Git.

475
0:31:32.680 --> 0:31:33.680
Git.

476
0:31:33.680 --> 0:31:34.680
Git.

477
0:31:34.680 --> 0:31:35.680
Git.

478
0:31:35.680 --> 0:31:36.680
Git.

479
0:31:36.680 --> 0:31:37.680
Git.

480
0:31:37.680 --> 0:31:38.680
Git.

481
0:31:38.680 --> 0:31:39.680
Git.

482
0:31:39.680 --> 0:31:46.680
The main cause of this format is that if you've ever used, I think it's a Docker, I think it

483
0:31:46.680 --> 0:31:49.040
was a Docker Compose command line client.

484
0:31:49.040 --> 0:31:51.160
You can kind of chain the Compose files.

485
0:31:51.160 --> 0:31:59.640
So you can say like Docker Compose up, Compose.yaml minus F, Compose.some-other-thing.yaml.

486
0:31:59.640 --> 0:32:05.120
And the system will internally merge all of these configurations together and then roll

487
0:32:05.120 --> 0:32:13.120
out the app, which I never had occasion to use until I realized that maybe somebody wants

488
0:32:13.120 --> 0:32:18.320
to use Postgres and maybe someone wants to use MariaDB.

489
0:32:18.320 --> 0:32:27.680
These simple choices for deployments, if it's not possible to kind of like make this easy

490
0:32:27.680 --> 0:32:31.820
to do between different groups, it would never work out.

491
0:32:31.820 --> 0:32:38.080
So very, very thankful to the people who wrote this standard.

492
0:32:38.080 --> 0:32:41.880
So you can see here, you can kind of, and it'll become clear when we talk about the

493
0:32:41.880 --> 0:32:48.200
command line client, you can kind of specify, okay, I want MariaDB and I want the SMTP config

494
0:32:48.200 --> 0:32:50.440
bundle all together, roll it out.

495
0:32:50.440 --> 0:32:54.080
And I don't want Postgres or I don't want this or I don't want that.

496
0:32:54.080 --> 0:32:58.520
And this allows people to just expand the config to suit their needs, document it, let

497
0:32:58.520 --> 0:32:59.920
people know this is a new feature.

498
0:32:59.920 --> 0:33:01.040
So it's quite nice.

499
0:33:01.040 --> 0:33:04.720
You can be just hosting some software and then somebody says, oh, great, OpenID Connect

500
0:33:04.720 --> 0:33:06.960
now works with this, just load this thing in.

501
0:33:06.960 --> 0:33:11.520
And, you know, this is really helping us move forward and get things done.

502
0:33:11.520 --> 0:33:19.480
Yeah, at the moment, we have a command line client called Abra.

503
0:33:19.480 --> 0:33:24.040
And this is the kind of day-to-day interface for how you manage your call cloud installs.

504
0:33:24.040 --> 0:33:28.320
So you have a server, you deploy stuff to the server, you're using Abra on the command

505
0:33:28.320 --> 0:33:29.780
line.

506
0:33:29.780 --> 0:33:35.960
That was a real, that was a large decision for us at the time because we didn't have

507
0:33:35.960 --> 0:33:36.960
much money.

508
0:33:36.960 --> 0:33:40.680
We didn't know if we would be able to pull off a web front end.

509
0:33:40.680 --> 0:33:45.000
And again, as I mentioned before, we were trying to target specifically, like, who is

510
0:33:45.000 --> 0:33:46.500
the public of this project?

511
0:33:46.500 --> 0:33:49.440
Are they people who know and are comfortable on the command line?

512
0:33:49.440 --> 0:33:50.440
Yes.

513
0:33:50.440 --> 0:33:54.640
Okay, let's just go ahead with this and try to make it work.

514
0:33:54.640 --> 0:33:59.140
So we wrote in Bash, the first one, and I still completely recommend it.

515
0:33:59.140 --> 0:34:02.040
Just unleash your inner Unix.

516
0:34:02.040 --> 0:34:03.080
It was great.

517
0:34:03.080 --> 0:34:11.800
It managed to get us to, you know, zero to hero in relatively short amount of time and

518
0:34:11.800 --> 0:34:14.640
have a system that was working.

519
0:34:14.640 --> 0:34:20.320
One of the kind of core ideas behind developing our own tools, we were very conscious that

520
0:34:20.320 --> 0:34:21.320
we might fail.

521
0:34:21.320 --> 0:34:24.320
We wouldn't be able to get it done.

522
0:34:24.320 --> 0:34:28.960
And we wanted to have that, the conflict commons would kind of live separately.

523
0:34:28.960 --> 0:34:34.840
So these would be kind of not interdependent in a way that if one broke, the other would

524
0:34:34.840 --> 0:34:36.080
break.

525
0:34:36.080 --> 0:34:43.020
So if you even today, if you just ignore that, you can still drop into the command line,

526
0:34:43.020 --> 0:34:47.300
run a bunch of commands and roll out the app, which is great.

527
0:34:47.300 --> 0:34:50.760
And that's kind of how we originally conceded with the Bash system.

528
0:34:50.760 --> 0:34:55.480
We were just running a bunch of commands and we had kind of laid it all out in a way that

529
0:34:55.480 --> 0:34:58.760
kind of said, okay, you can just push that out.

530
0:34:58.760 --> 0:35:04.160
So yeah, thanks to Kalex, a fellow worker who's great at Bash programming.

531
0:35:04.160 --> 0:35:07.240
We wouldn't have done it without them.

532
0:35:07.240 --> 0:35:08.280
Yes.

533
0:35:08.280 --> 0:35:09.440
So then we rewrote and go.

534
0:35:09.440 --> 0:35:15.000
We actually managed to get some funding, which we'll come to after.

535
0:35:15.000 --> 0:35:18.560
I guess they're not Bash programmers, if they read the source.

536
0:35:18.560 --> 0:35:20.080
They might have felt otherwise.

537
0:35:20.080 --> 0:35:26.720
But at that point, we were running into issues with the Bash implementation, which we felt

538
0:35:26.720 --> 0:35:33.840
quite proud about, that we had gone ahead and found the limits of the simplest possible

539
0:35:33.840 --> 0:35:37.200
thing that we could do.

540
0:35:37.200 --> 0:35:42.640
And the issues were it was difficult to install on multiple systems.

541
0:35:42.640 --> 0:35:47.800
It relied on a number of built-in commands that were not always available on, you know,

542
0:35:47.800 --> 0:35:51.120
like a Fedora, Debian or whatever.

543
0:35:51.120 --> 0:35:53.860
So yeah, portability.

544
0:35:53.860 --> 0:35:59.720
We were struggling with, we wanted to kind of develop other aspects of, like we wanted

545
0:35:59.720 --> 0:36:05.200
the tools to be able to speak to the config commons, but not directly parse each other.

546
0:36:05.200 --> 0:36:07.800
And that ended up being a kind of like JSON catalog.

547
0:36:07.800 --> 0:36:14.280
But then parsing data formats in Bash is difficult, so we were kind of pulling our hair out on

548
0:36:14.280 --> 0:36:16.320
that one.

549
0:36:16.320 --> 0:36:18.860
And then concurrency.

550
0:36:18.860 --> 0:36:22.360
We were struggling to manage horizontal scaling.

551
0:36:22.360 --> 0:36:27.080
So if you work with 18 groups, they want to have their own VPSs.

552
0:36:27.080 --> 0:36:32.320
If you have 10 servers, you know, the tool has to, like, fire a request at each 10 of

553
0:36:32.320 --> 0:36:33.320
them or whatever.

554
0:36:33.320 --> 0:36:38.560
And then if it's going through each one at a time, you have to wait.

555
0:36:38.560 --> 0:36:45.000
And as a result of kind of scaling up and using this absolutely pre-alpha software and

556
0:36:45.000 --> 0:36:50.560
autonomic for production purposes, we reached the limits of the software.

557
0:36:50.560 --> 0:36:52.760
So we ended up rewriting it in Go.

558
0:36:52.760 --> 0:36:54.920
Somebody knew Go in autonomic at the time.

559
0:36:54.920 --> 0:36:56.400
That's the reason.

560
0:36:56.400 --> 0:37:04.160
But also we saw that it was really, you know, we could get this concurrency issue sorted

561
0:37:04.160 --> 0:37:05.200
and the portability.

562
0:37:05.200 --> 0:37:10.720
So Go kind of gives you a language-level feature that's quite easy to say, like, fire a request

563
0:37:10.720 --> 0:37:12.600
at these 10 things immediately.

564
0:37:12.600 --> 0:37:16.480
And you can build a binary, so you can just fire them out.

565
0:37:16.480 --> 0:37:23.700
So people just get, like, a binary in the system, and this stuff is all baked into it.

566
0:37:23.700 --> 0:37:28.120
So the new problem with this is that it actually works.

567
0:37:28.120 --> 0:37:30.280
It does what it says, and people are starting to use it.

568
0:37:30.280 --> 0:37:33.520
So we're now into this kind of maintenance cycle.

569
0:37:33.520 --> 0:37:34.920
It's kind of approach.

570
0:37:34.920 --> 0:37:41.120
We've done the public beta, so people are using it and starting to rely on it.

571
0:37:41.120 --> 0:37:45.880
And we've seen people hacking on it and submitting pull requests and checking it out.

572
0:37:45.880 --> 0:37:47.520
It's all good.

573
0:37:47.520 --> 0:37:53.600
Yeah, so in essence, Abra is a Docker swarm client.

574
0:37:53.600 --> 0:37:57.440
So no, we don't run Kubernetes.

575
0:37:57.440 --> 0:37:58.440
We run Docker swarm.

576
0:37:58.440 --> 0:37:59.440
And no, it's not dead.

577
0:37:59.440 --> 0:38:04.920
Docker swarm is a technology that is still alive.

578
0:38:04.920 --> 0:38:11.680
We have, like, a strange, pyrocynical relationship with, like, some installs.

579
0:38:11.680 --> 0:38:15.920
Like some banks have, like, a swarm install of, like, you know, 10,000 nodes or something.

580
0:38:15.920 --> 0:38:20.840
And the current owner, I believe it's Marantis or something that's been in exchange of who

581
0:38:20.840 --> 0:38:23.240
owns it or who, yeah, I can't remember.

582
0:38:23.240 --> 0:38:30.560
But it's still being maintained, and we're happy to see that it is being maintained.

583
0:38:30.560 --> 0:38:38.400
Because we identify that swarm mode in Docker is kind of the appropriate feature set that

584
0:38:38.400 --> 0:38:48.040
we need without having to deal with going into learning how to, you know, roll out a

585
0:38:48.040 --> 0:38:51.240
large system which is built for, like, large scale.

586
0:38:51.240 --> 0:38:56.440
Our, you know, and again, this is, like, what was Autonomic doing at the time was, like,

587
0:38:56.440 --> 0:39:01.520
rolling out single servers, deploying a few apps, no greater than, like, 10 to 30, 50,

588
0:39:01.520 --> 0:39:05.280
100 users or whatever.

589
0:39:05.280 --> 0:39:09.720
And swarm mode provides you with the ability to kind of roll out the app, and if it fails,

590
0:39:09.720 --> 0:39:11.320
it will roll it back for you.

591
0:39:11.320 --> 0:39:12.880
And we can bake that into our config.

592
0:39:12.880 --> 0:39:18.440
So we were kind of getting the stability guarantees that we needed.

593
0:39:18.440 --> 0:39:21.920
And not a lot of groups were demanding, you know, when they had, like, a media wiki installed,

594
0:39:21.920 --> 0:39:27.640
they weren't saying there must be 99% uptime in this contract or whatever.

595
0:39:27.640 --> 0:39:33.080
But we still wanted to push that to the limit, like, a high quality, stable service when

596
0:39:33.080 --> 0:39:35.160
we're rolling stuff out.

597
0:39:35.160 --> 0:39:39.680
This should be, yeah.

598
0:39:39.680 --> 0:39:45.800
And then, yeah, this swarm mode just covers that for us, the runtime, the container runtime.

599
0:39:45.800 --> 0:39:51.320
Yeah, this is kind of like the Abra architecture, let's say.

600
0:39:51.320 --> 0:39:57.640
So on the left, you will install Abra, for example, on your local workstation, the command

601
0:39:57.640 --> 0:40:04.080
line tool, and then you'll, via SSH, kind of tell Abra to manage this server.

602
0:40:04.080 --> 0:40:08.960
So it'll read the SSH config and it'll connect to the server and say, okay, I recognize this

603
0:40:08.960 --> 0:40:13.240
server, I see there's a Docker daemon running on this and it's got swarm mode enabled.

604
0:40:13.240 --> 0:40:14.680
Cool.

605
0:40:14.680 --> 0:40:18.640
And then it can, you know, you can do this horizontal scaling where you can have several

606
0:40:18.640 --> 0:40:19.640
servers.

607
0:40:19.640 --> 0:40:28.760
You can load multiple servers into Abra and then you can be sharing the Abra state between

608
0:40:28.760 --> 0:40:29.760
multiple people.

609
0:40:29.760 --> 0:40:37.840
So in a co-op of 13 people, you know, each one who runs Abra, appLS, or whatever, to

610
0:40:37.840 --> 0:40:43.200
list the apps and the servers, we'll see the same state come out.

611
0:40:43.200 --> 0:40:45.280
And we can go into that a bit later.

612
0:40:45.280 --> 0:40:52.920
So yeah, it's built for basically collaboration in the organization that you're in.

613
0:40:52.920 --> 0:40:57.000
And then the other mode is you install Abra directly on the server and it stores the state

614
0:40:57.000 --> 0:41:04.600
on the server, which could be useful if you're, yeah, for specific scenarios, this was requested.

615
0:41:04.600 --> 0:41:06.720
Yeah, some people run this.

616
0:41:06.720 --> 0:41:08.560
I don't myself.

617
0:41:08.560 --> 0:41:12.480
Yeah, and then the final points.

618
0:41:12.480 --> 0:41:13.480
Moving on.

619
0:41:13.480 --> 0:41:14.480
Collective infrastructure.

620
0:41:14.480 --> 0:41:19.000
Yeah, docs, Git hosting, recipes.cloud.tech here.

621
0:41:19.000 --> 0:41:23.400
You can see the list of all the apps we have.

622
0:41:23.400 --> 0:41:28.440
We have an open collective, which is the fiscal host is autonomic.

623
0:41:28.440 --> 0:41:30.480
Bank account in the UK.

624
0:41:30.480 --> 0:41:35.400
And that's been nice because we've been able to, once we got the funding, we were able

625
0:41:35.400 --> 0:41:40.800
to tell people, if you work on this, we can pay you just immediately.

626
0:41:40.800 --> 0:41:42.760
Anything you do, you'll get paid.

627
0:41:42.760 --> 0:41:47.120
And that's great because we know there's a lot of unpaid labor going on in open source

628
0:41:47.120 --> 0:41:48.680
world.

629
0:41:48.680 --> 0:41:51.840
So we didn't want to be a project that said, contribute to our commons and get nothing

630
0:41:51.840 --> 0:41:52.840
back.

631
0:41:52.840 --> 0:41:53.840
No, we could actually pay.

632
0:41:53.840 --> 0:41:57.880
So we set an hourly wage there and we said, this is how much money we have and away you

633
0:41:57.880 --> 0:41:58.880
go.

634
0:41:58.880 --> 0:42:02.920
That worked out great, I would say.

635
0:42:02.920 --> 0:42:04.800
And the server firm, Server Co-op.

636
0:42:04.800 --> 0:42:07.400
So I wanted to plug this other project.

637
0:42:07.400 --> 0:42:09.920
You can go to the website, servers.coop.

638
0:42:09.920 --> 0:42:18.560
Yeah, we've been working with a group who have been developing software called Capsule,

639
0:42:18.560 --> 0:42:21.360
Siberia, great hackers.

640
0:42:21.360 --> 0:42:22.720
And they're trying to develop a system.

641
0:42:22.720 --> 0:42:29.360
Well, they have developed a system, which is basically a server provider infrastructure

642
0:42:29.360 --> 0:42:31.800
like Hetzner, for example.

643
0:42:31.800 --> 0:42:33.200
So VPSs.

644
0:42:33.200 --> 0:42:34.520
I need a server to roll one out.

645
0:42:34.520 --> 0:42:37.200
I need another server to roll one out.

646
0:42:37.200 --> 0:42:41.760
And then we, and a couple of other people, myself included, were thinking, okay, this

647
0:42:41.760 --> 0:42:49.240
is great because a lot of collectors are centralizing on server, Hetzner VPSs, right?

648
0:42:49.240 --> 0:42:53.120
And if Hetzner rolls up the price or, you know, we've already seen this with the increase

649
0:42:53.120 --> 0:42:58.520
in cost in IPv4 addresses and the 10% increase this year.

650
0:42:58.520 --> 0:43:01.840
It's getting more costly to run on Hetzner, but it's always been super cheap and that's

651
0:43:01.840 --> 0:43:04.440
been super accessible.

652
0:43:04.440 --> 0:43:05.440
But it could change.

653
0:43:05.440 --> 0:43:06.440
So what do we do?

654
0:43:06.440 --> 0:43:08.800
We need to build up this aspect of our stack.

655
0:43:08.800 --> 0:43:13.040
So we kind of like expand the cooperative layer down to the servers.

656
0:43:13.040 --> 0:43:17.760
And that is the idea behind server's co-op.

657
0:43:17.760 --> 0:43:20.640
And Abra already supports an integration.

658
0:43:20.640 --> 0:43:22.720
So you can do like server new.

659
0:43:22.720 --> 0:43:28.680
And if you've got Capsule running on your server, it'll spin up a VM.

660
0:43:28.680 --> 0:43:35.160
So we were already trying to like, you know, just take a turn into cooperatively managed

661
0:43:35.160 --> 0:43:39.720
infrastructure and build those integrations from the start.

662
0:43:39.720 --> 0:43:42.920
Whether or not they're working that great is for me to be seen.

663
0:43:42.920 --> 0:43:50.160
But yes, so European Cultural Foundation gave us upwards of 30 grand in funding last year

664
0:43:50.160 --> 0:43:54.760
and the year before for in the context of the Culture of Solidarity Fund.

665
0:43:54.760 --> 0:43:56.320
That was amazing.

666
0:43:56.320 --> 0:43:57.880
Thanks to them.

667
0:43:57.880 --> 0:43:59.200
They were really great.

668
0:43:59.200 --> 0:44:00.960
And I would recommend applying to them.

669
0:44:00.960 --> 0:44:02.320
They support us the whole way through.

670
0:44:02.320 --> 0:44:03.320
It was.

671
0:44:03.320 --> 0:44:04.320
Yeah.

672
0:44:04.320 --> 0:44:05.320
It was just fantastic.

673
0:44:05.320 --> 0:44:07.760
We wrote our application and sent it into them.

674
0:44:07.760 --> 0:44:12.440
So pretty happy with that one.

675
0:44:12.440 --> 0:44:13.440
Great.

676
0:44:13.440 --> 0:44:14.440
Nearly done.

677
0:44:14.440 --> 0:44:15.440
Yeah.

678
0:44:15.440 --> 0:44:16.440
I want to just jump.

679
0:44:16.440 --> 0:44:17.440
So this is in paperwork.

680
0:44:17.440 --> 0:44:21.960
Again, I want to plug like, I just find it so important to explain that people are actually

681
0:44:21.960 --> 0:44:25.600
using this and this isn't just like some idea in our heads and we think it's cool.

682
0:44:25.600 --> 0:44:30.520
It's like people are actually running, you know, they rely on some of the things that

683
0:44:30.520 --> 0:44:31.520
have been deployed.

684
0:44:31.520 --> 0:44:38.280
The London Black Space is a project which is about like 13 apps, I think, on a server

685
0:44:38.280 --> 0:44:44.040
somewhere, which was initiated by an artist collective called Ron Grupa, which is like

686
0:44:44.040 --> 0:44:50.000
an Indonesian based collective in the context of Documenta.

687
0:44:50.000 --> 0:44:58.120
And they wanted to kind of approach a group that connected with their values.

688
0:44:58.120 --> 0:45:01.400
At some point they were so they were invited to Documenta to do the work and they thought,

689
0:45:01.400 --> 0:45:04.760
okay, we're all the way over here.

690
0:45:04.760 --> 0:45:08.440
In Indonesia, we need to work with people who are based in Europe, so we're going to

691
0:45:08.440 --> 0:45:12.480
need digital tools, but we don't want to be immediately going on the Google drives of

692
0:45:12.480 --> 0:45:13.480
the world.

693
0:45:13.480 --> 0:45:18.440
So how do we build up, you know, extend our ways of working and our values into the digital

694
0:45:18.440 --> 0:45:19.440
realm?

695
0:45:19.440 --> 0:45:23.080
So then they came looking for collectives and co-ops.

696
0:45:23.080 --> 0:45:24.840
Fran put us through to them.

697
0:45:24.840 --> 0:45:33.840
Yeah, and here's just some photos of us just engaging in this massively multiplayer shared

698
0:45:33.840 --> 0:45:35.040
infrastructure project.

699
0:45:35.040 --> 0:45:36.680
So it was really great.

700
0:45:36.680 --> 0:45:43.400
People from my perspective understood what Co-op Cloud was and the mission behind it

701
0:45:43.400 --> 0:45:49.080
and felt invited to kind of look at the technology and what we were doing and comment on that

702
0:45:49.080 --> 0:45:50.200
and give us critique.

703
0:45:50.200 --> 0:45:55.760
You know, we're often in a space where people want to talk about digital tools, but the

704
0:45:55.760 --> 0:45:59.920
first thing they say is, oh, I don't know anything about technology, which is kind of

705
0:45:59.920 --> 0:46:00.920
like a hallmark.

706
0:46:00.920 --> 0:46:03.160
You have to like excuse yourself or something.

707
0:46:03.160 --> 0:46:09.040
But we got past that in working with this group of people that may not find themselves

708
0:46:09.040 --> 0:46:10.600
technical.

709
0:46:10.600 --> 0:46:17.200
But as we moved on, again, Co-op Cloud allowed us to just kind of like deploy the tech and

710
0:46:17.200 --> 0:46:22.400
just like just forget about it and then go on with the support work.

711
0:46:22.400 --> 0:46:28.080
And we ended up with like the last great thing I saw from this project was the people involved

712
0:46:28.080 --> 0:46:33.680
in using the tools were publishing videos about how to use the tools in the stacks.

713
0:46:33.680 --> 0:46:37.320
So they were like in the matrix chat and on the peer tube publishing.

714
0:46:37.320 --> 0:46:39.520
Here's how you use peer tube.

715
0:46:39.520 --> 0:46:40.520
Amazing.

716
0:46:40.520 --> 0:46:42.040
Great educational practice.

717
0:46:42.040 --> 0:46:43.040
Totally check it out.

718
0:46:43.040 --> 0:46:46.320
TV.Lum

719
0:46:46.320 --> 0:46:49.320
Among Us Space is the website.

720
0:46:49.320 --> 0:46:52.000
This was another project we met kind of in the context of the documentary.

721
0:46:52.000 --> 0:46:58.880
So this is a comic illustrator's union, which is bootstrapping at the moment.

722
0:46:58.880 --> 0:47:05.280
And they felt, you know, they saw Lum Among Us Space and they were like, this looks cool.

723
0:47:05.280 --> 0:47:07.520
And I like the idea of what is going on.

724
0:47:07.520 --> 0:47:10.440
I understand what is happening here.

725
0:47:10.440 --> 0:47:16.520
There are two groups cooperating here, this kind of like cultural based initiative and

726
0:47:16.520 --> 0:47:18.680
this technology collective.

727
0:47:18.680 --> 0:47:23.200
And you know, I can see the Co-op Cloud website and this looks like we want to check this

728
0:47:23.200 --> 0:47:24.200
out.

729
0:47:24.200 --> 0:47:29.800
So we kind of got over that fear and anxiety and moved through the money exchange and,

730
0:47:29.800 --> 0:47:31.560
you know, let's work together.

731
0:47:31.560 --> 0:47:32.560
It was quite smooth.

732
0:47:32.560 --> 0:47:36.840
So I would say Co-op Cloud is then helping us just again, put these things to rest.

733
0:47:36.840 --> 0:47:42.200
Like this is the project we're based on, you know, when we work, when we deploy your infrastructure,

734
0:47:42.200 --> 0:47:46.360
it will be contributing to the commons, copy left, democratically managed.

735
0:47:46.360 --> 0:47:50.000
You know, you kind of just get over the hump.

736
0:47:50.000 --> 0:47:55.600
And yeah, Kotec is a new co-op, which is starting in Poland.

737
0:47:55.600 --> 0:47:57.480
And that was a major boost.

738
0:47:57.480 --> 0:47:59.920
So they've deployed a bunch of services.

739
0:47:59.920 --> 0:48:02.800
Some members are in the room.

740
0:48:02.800 --> 0:48:03.800
Super nice.

741
0:48:03.800 --> 0:48:11.200
Yeah, it's a software stack which is in its, you know, initiated and developed by Co-operative.

742
0:48:11.200 --> 0:48:13.640
So it should suit other cooperatives to food strap.

743
0:48:13.640 --> 0:48:17.960
And of course, if you want to start a new technology cooperative, how do you start?

744
0:48:17.960 --> 0:48:19.440
It's overwhelming.

745
0:48:19.440 --> 0:48:25.520
But now you've got this off the shelf project and it's like, get going.

746
0:48:25.520 --> 0:48:30.520
And once you enter it, you just see all the other collectives and you're like, great,

747
0:48:30.520 --> 0:48:32.600
we can learn, we can share, you know.

748
0:48:32.600 --> 0:48:34.400
And again, it expands beyond the technical.

749
0:48:34.400 --> 0:48:37.920
So we have the infrastructure for payment and bank accounts and all this stuff.

750
0:48:37.920 --> 0:48:42.480
So people can really get moving fast, I think, is good.

751
0:48:42.480 --> 0:48:48.480
And we want to expand the, you know, we want people to start technology cooperatives, start

752
0:48:48.480 --> 0:48:50.320
technology cooperatives.

753
0:48:50.320 --> 0:48:56.280
Yes, Enterprise Metrics, 21 collectives.

754
0:48:56.280 --> 0:48:57.280
Somebody counted them.

755
0:48:57.280 --> 0:48:58.320
Maybe it was me at some point.

756
0:48:58.320 --> 0:49:01.400
But there's a lot of groups involved in this.

757
0:49:01.400 --> 0:49:07.600
If you go on the website, it's in the blog post, a list of them.

758
0:49:07.600 --> 0:49:09.840
We've got 160 plus recipes.

759
0:49:09.840 --> 0:49:11.400
This is a lot of open source apps.

760
0:49:11.400 --> 0:49:15.480
You could probably find what you need in there.

761
0:49:15.480 --> 0:49:18.240
And yeah, we're running 146 apps.

762
0:49:18.240 --> 0:49:22.320
I think I ran Abra app LS at some points.

763
0:49:22.320 --> 0:49:24.680
So Autonaut because heavily invested in this.

764
0:49:24.680 --> 0:49:29.560
And there are other collectives which are running the stack.

765
0:49:29.560 --> 0:49:33.760
Yeah, and maybe just kind of coming to the end.

766
0:49:33.760 --> 0:49:35.360
It's been a lot of details.

767
0:49:35.360 --> 0:49:39.520
I'm even overwhelmed myself.

768
0:49:39.520 --> 0:49:49.280
The last few slides, kind of philosophy take, you know, we wanted to be another project

769
0:49:49.280 --> 0:49:58.400
in the ecosystem and not just become the project in relation to decentralization, let's say.

770
0:49:58.400 --> 0:50:06.560
We really posit ourselves against this big tech discourse and what's happening.

771
0:50:06.560 --> 0:50:13.440
And we thought we could contribute to internet and digital infrastructure decentralization

772
0:50:13.440 --> 0:50:18.560
by proposing Cloud in its format.

773
0:50:18.560 --> 0:50:19.840
And we're only one project.

774
0:50:19.840 --> 0:50:25.040
So I thought it would be good to plug some other great projects which I just find super

775
0:50:25.040 --> 0:50:26.040
inspiring.

776
0:50:26.040 --> 0:50:33.360
And I would say Uno host is maybe one of the gold standards of community organized infrastructure

777
0:50:33.360 --> 0:50:34.640
hosting.

778
0:50:34.640 --> 0:50:40.240
It has a different kind of set of priorities and goals.

779
0:50:40.240 --> 0:50:41.800
Everyone can be a system administrator.

780
0:50:41.800 --> 0:50:43.680
It's kind of their goal.

781
0:50:43.680 --> 0:50:45.520
Let's make information available to people.

782
0:50:45.520 --> 0:50:46.520
Anyone can do this.

783
0:50:46.520 --> 0:50:47.520
Get going.

784
0:50:47.520 --> 0:50:48.800
Brilliant project.

785
0:50:48.800 --> 0:50:53.720
Whereas we're going for specific groups, co-ops.

786
0:50:53.720 --> 0:50:55.200
You're already in the game.

787
0:50:55.200 --> 0:50:57.480
How can we make it easier to keep going?

788
0:50:57.480 --> 0:50:59.120
So it's a bit of the different layers.

789
0:50:59.120 --> 0:51:01.280
But I absolutely recommend Uno host.

790
0:51:01.280 --> 0:51:02.640
Nubo is based in Brussels.

791
0:51:02.640 --> 0:51:03.640
Check them out.

792
0:51:03.640 --> 0:51:05.720
Chateau's great network.

793
0:51:05.720 --> 0:51:09.000
Co-tech is a network of cooperatives based in the UK.

794
0:51:09.000 --> 0:51:11.200
I think it's like 35 cooperatives.

795
0:51:11.200 --> 0:51:12.720
Check them out if you're looking for a job.

796
0:51:12.720 --> 0:51:15.520
Get stuck in.

797
0:51:15.520 --> 0:51:21.840
Social co-op trying to build cooperatively managed mass-on-instances.

798
0:51:21.840 --> 0:51:28.160
MIT, great collective already involved in co-op cloud at the moment.

799
0:51:28.160 --> 0:51:29.160
Small technology foundation.

800
0:51:29.160 --> 0:51:30.800
Always find this worrying.

801
0:51:30.800 --> 0:51:32.880
Check that out.

802
0:51:32.880 --> 0:51:33.880
Just plug in them.

803
0:51:33.880 --> 0:51:34.880
Yeah.

804
0:51:34.880 --> 0:51:36.280
Oh, five minutes.

805
0:51:36.280 --> 0:51:37.280
Cool.

806
0:51:37.280 --> 0:51:40.400
The roadmap is, as I said, building the federation.

807
0:51:40.400 --> 0:51:45.320
So now is a great time to join.

808
0:51:45.320 --> 0:51:52.520
As an individual, a collective co-op, please get involved if you want to.

809
0:51:52.520 --> 0:51:55.800
We're trying to find more money, of course.

810
0:51:55.800 --> 0:52:01.640
One of the goals of the federation is to achieve financial sustainability.

811
0:52:01.640 --> 0:52:08.280
So the co-ops that join or the groups that join the project will be...

812
0:52:08.280 --> 0:52:14.200
We're going to have to decide, all right, how do we fund development of the tool?

813
0:52:14.200 --> 0:52:20.680
And can we pay for hours around finance, admin, triage, all this stuff?

814
0:52:20.680 --> 0:52:27.600
Yeah, Kadabra is a kind of new effort to kind of have a server-side component which is...

815
0:52:27.600 --> 0:52:33.400
And this is the thing that Cloud Run did amazingly well, which is just auto-updating the apps.

816
0:52:33.400 --> 0:52:37.920
So we're trying to replicate that in terms of the server-side component, which understands,

817
0:52:37.920 --> 0:52:43.400
you know, oh, someone who takes care of that recipe has uploaded a new version.

818
0:52:43.400 --> 0:52:45.200
I'm going to roll it out.

819
0:52:45.200 --> 0:52:47.400
And yeah, web interface.

820
0:52:47.400 --> 0:52:52.920
I forgot to add maybe because it's still under discussion if we need that or not.

821
0:52:52.920 --> 0:52:56.760
Yes, getting to the end.

822
0:52:56.760 --> 0:52:59.760
I could do a demo, a chaos demo.

823
0:52:59.760 --> 0:53:02.160
Your demo or questions?

824
0:53:02.160 --> 0:53:04.520
Yeah, we have five minutes.

825
0:53:04.520 --> 0:53:05.520
Yeah, okay.

826
0:53:05.520 --> 0:53:06.960
Maybe I'll just do a chaos demo.

827
0:53:06.960 --> 0:53:10.400
So I wanted to, like, run...

828
0:53:10.400 --> 0:53:12.880
Yes.

829
0:53:12.880 --> 0:53:18.080
Just show you the command line client.

830
0:53:18.080 --> 0:53:24.840
So, again, to contextualize, this is the tool that people who maintain the service will

831
0:53:24.840 --> 0:53:26.520
be running on a daily basis.

832
0:53:26.520 --> 0:53:31.400
So it's supposed to make the job easy.

833
0:53:31.400 --> 0:53:39.600
And I won't go through all of that at the moment, but, you know, it's...

834
0:53:39.600 --> 0:53:43.320
You know, we try to take effort to, like, explain the concepts that are involved in

835
0:53:43.320 --> 0:53:46.600
the project and what you can do.

836
0:53:46.600 --> 0:53:59.440
You know, you can list all the recipes that are available from the command line, for example.

837
0:53:59.440 --> 0:54:04.400
And yeah, you can also do operations on recipes here.

838
0:54:04.400 --> 0:54:10.560
So you can, like, attempt to upgrade...

839
0:54:10.560 --> 0:54:11.560
Oh, I probably don't have internet.

840
0:54:11.560 --> 0:54:12.560
Yeah, right.

841
0:54:12.560 --> 0:54:16.800
Okay, well, anyway, you can kind of, like, do the maintenance commands on the spot.

842
0:54:16.800 --> 0:54:19.100
So again, you're on your local workstation.

843
0:54:19.100 --> 0:54:21.840
You realize that there's a new version of Next Cloud is coming out.

844
0:54:21.840 --> 0:54:23.400
Okay, let's get that upgraded.

845
0:54:23.400 --> 0:54:25.240
And then you can run the commands here.

846
0:54:25.240 --> 0:54:33.880
And that'll basically operate on this directory, Abba recipes, where you can see a selection

847
0:54:33.880 --> 0:54:35.080
of the apps.

848
0:54:35.080 --> 0:54:36.960
And then, you know, this is just the...

849
0:54:36.960 --> 0:54:39.720
What I showed earlier, the recipe repository.

850
0:54:39.720 --> 0:54:48.600
So this is the configuration that specifies how to deploy this app.

851
0:54:48.600 --> 0:54:52.440
Yeah, and there's some other details that I didn't really go into.

852
0:54:52.440 --> 0:54:59.360
But basically, one of the nice things that we've wired up is that if you deploy this

853
0:54:59.360 --> 0:55:04.120
app called Trafic, that when you roll out Next Cloud, it automatically configures the

854
0:55:04.120 --> 0:55:05.120
lesson-crypt stuff.

855
0:55:05.120 --> 0:55:09.040
So you just don't have to deal with this HTTPS issue.

856
0:55:09.040 --> 0:55:10.240
It's already in the config.

857
0:55:10.240 --> 0:55:13.280
You just say, give me a thing.

858
0:55:13.280 --> 0:55:16.920
Yeah, I don't know.

859
0:55:16.920 --> 0:55:17.920
Is there much more?

860
0:55:17.920 --> 0:55:20.200
Oh, yeah, I guess, yeah.

861
0:55:20.200 --> 0:55:25.360
And then there's just kind of this, like, command and control interface where you can see, like,

862
0:55:25.360 --> 0:55:30.160
okay, what apps have I got on what servers and, you know, what do I need to do?

863
0:55:30.160 --> 0:55:35.720
And you can kind of, like, you know, filter it by server or whatever.

864
0:55:35.720 --> 0:55:37.120
I won't type it out now.

865
0:55:37.120 --> 0:55:43.040
But yeah, maybe I'll call it a day.

866
0:55:43.040 --> 0:56:00.040
Thank you for listening to me talk for so long.
