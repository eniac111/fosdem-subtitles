0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.680
We are starting with the first talk in the Sovereign Cloud Devroom and it's my great

2
0:00:09.680 --> 0:00:16.720
pleasure to open the stage for Max, who's going to elaborate on how he created a documentation

3
0:00:16.720 --> 0:00:19.640
framework for the Sovereign Cloud Stack.

4
0:00:19.640 --> 0:00:21.380
Enjoy, have fun.

5
0:00:21.380 --> 0:00:22.380
Thank you very much.

6
0:00:22.380 --> 0:00:27.480
Hi everybody.

7
0:00:27.480 --> 0:00:28.480
Thank you.

8
0:00:28.480 --> 0:00:33.040
How did we create a documentation framework that works across a group of vendors in the

9
0:00:33.040 --> 0:00:34.640
Sovereign Cloud Stack community?

10
0:00:34.640 --> 0:00:35.640
This I will show you.

11
0:00:35.640 --> 0:00:36.640
My name is Max.

12
0:00:36.640 --> 0:00:43.600
I'm a knowledge management engineer at the Sovereign Cloud Stack and my background is

13
0:00:43.600 --> 0:00:47.160
broadly in web development.

14
0:00:47.160 --> 0:00:49.800
The talk, TLDR, what is it?

15
0:00:49.800 --> 0:00:54.120
Basically it's a set of GitHub action workflows to copy markdown folders and files from many

16
0:00:54.120 --> 0:00:59.040
a's to one single b and once that's done, b is being built into a single page application

17
0:00:59.040 --> 0:01:08.240
resulting in the Sovereign Cloud Stack documentation at docs.scs.community and here, pull out your

18
0:01:08.240 --> 0:01:12.480
mobile phones and have a look at it.

19
0:01:12.480 --> 0:01:15.200
I will now elaborate what's behind this.

20
0:01:15.200 --> 0:01:17.560
What is the Sovereign Cloud Stack?

21
0:01:17.560 --> 0:01:21.240
The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of cloud computing in one unified standard

22
0:01:21.240 --> 0:01:31.280
and SCS is built, backed and operated by an active open source committee worldwide.

23
0:01:31.280 --> 0:01:40.240
This is the SCS stack and it's made up from many modules and it's quite complex and there

24
0:01:40.240 --> 0:01:48.800
is of course documentation but it's heavily distributed at different places on the internet

25
0:01:48.800 --> 0:01:51.880
and that's quite difficult to keep track on.

26
0:01:51.880 --> 0:01:52.880
Where do we have to go?

27
0:01:52.880 --> 0:01:57.160
Where do I have to be routed as an integrator developer?

28
0:01:57.160 --> 0:02:01.960
That's quite a challenge.

29
0:02:01.960 --> 0:02:06.800
As an integrator and operator, you have to manage different documentations in different

30
0:02:06.800 --> 0:02:11.400
Git repositories and different docs and it would be nice to have them within one platform

31
0:02:11.400 --> 0:02:20.000
to search and to have guides and tutorials and references and a great DX or UX.

32
0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:23.520
But how could you do this?

33
0:02:23.520 --> 0:02:29.600
This was my challenge and the aim and requirements for the documentation is it has to be like

34
0:02:29.600 --> 0:02:37.520
a minimal rule set where the approval is basically a no-brainer and all doc files will reside

35
0:02:37.520 --> 0:02:44.840
in one place and it must be probably the biggest challenge, a low entry hurdle for companies

36
0:02:44.840 --> 0:02:49.120
with existing repositories because no one wants to change the whole documentation if

37
0:02:49.120 --> 0:02:53.720
it's being consumed by another stack basically.

38
0:02:53.720 --> 0:03:00.160
So no one has to make any major changes and then we are thinking about could it be made

39
0:03:00.160 --> 0:03:07.560
up with Git sub modules and no, it's too complex to manage and Git subtree was then

40
0:03:07.560 --> 0:03:14.440
okay this could be nice but actually it would, yeah, it's not cool too and then other vendors

41
0:03:14.440 --> 0:03:21.280
said no we don't want to change anything in our existing repositories.

42
0:03:21.280 --> 0:03:27.920
So then we had a great community hackathon in Cologne in November 22 hosted by PlusServer

43
0:03:27.920 --> 0:03:34.400
where we have developed in eight hours straight in a tunnel a working prototype with a custom

44
0:03:34.400 --> 0:03:40.440
GitHub actions workflow or combination of this and this is one of the great things with

45
0:03:40.440 --> 0:03:47.000
the Sovereign Cloudstack community that everyone is joining forces to actually elaborate on

46
0:03:47.000 --> 0:03:49.440
the common challenges.

47
0:03:49.440 --> 0:03:56.080
So yeah thanks also shout out to Ramona and Tim who worked on this prototype with me on

48
0:03:56.080 --> 0:04:04.160
this day from OSISM.

49
0:04:04.160 --> 0:04:05.640
So how does it work?

50
0:04:05.640 --> 0:04:15.160
Basically it's GitHub actions workflow, it's actually three workflows as you see here and

51
0:04:15.160 --> 0:04:21.680
the whole concept is a docuosaurus react based static side generator you may have heard of

52
0:04:21.680 --> 0:04:32.440
it's source by meta and the three action workflows are divided in collecting all the different

53
0:04:32.440 --> 0:04:37.960
documentation files then distilling them that you only have the markdown files from the

54
0:04:37.960 --> 0:04:42.560
repository and then it's being built and deployed.

55
0:04:42.560 --> 0:04:51.440
Let's jump into how this works and we defined docs.package.json where you define which doc

56
0:04:51.440 --> 0:04:57.840
files you need from which organizations repositories and so basically it's a package manager for

57
0:04:57.840 --> 0:04:59.280
docs.

58
0:04:59.280 --> 0:05:04.560
So in the first line you have the repo with the organization so sovereigncloudstack.docs

59
0:05:04.560 --> 0:05:11.120
is the first one and then you define the source directory where the docs files reside in or

60
0:05:11.120 --> 0:05:16.480
the folder and the next line is then you define the target where should it be placed in the

61
0:05:16.480 --> 0:05:23.440
site currently there's a community page and a docs page and docs for technical documentation

62
0:05:23.440 --> 0:05:28.520
the community page for how we organize in a community and also contributors guide and

63
0:05:28.520 --> 0:05:33.920
the labels then how it should reside in the navigation.

64
0:05:33.920 --> 0:05:41.240
Then the first workflow is reading the JSON and then defining a matrix strategy within

65
0:05:41.240 --> 0:05:53.120
GitHub actions so for each element in the docs.json a workflow is being run.

66
0:05:53.120 --> 0:05:58.360
So this is the whole synchronizing and distilling workflow we call it distilling because it's

67
0:05:58.360 --> 0:06:05.720
like in a distilling process refining what has to be done and all the source code because

68
0:06:05.720 --> 0:06:11.040
most of the time there's a source code and then in one doc file or docs folder there

69
0:06:11.040 --> 0:06:17.040
is all the documentation which we want the other source files we don't want so we're

70
0:06:17.040 --> 0:06:18.640
distilling it.

71
0:06:18.640 --> 0:06:22.000
So we'll quickly go through the workflow.

72
0:06:22.000 --> 0:06:36.640
The first one is checking out the repository with secrets action token then it's first

73
0:06:36.640 --> 0:06:46.360
doing a clean install so it's removing all the previous files which resided in the documentary

74
0:06:46.360 --> 0:06:51.440
so just removing all that was there.

75
0:06:51.440 --> 0:06:56.480
Then it's cloning the repository A which is about to be synchronized into the checked

76
0:06:56.480 --> 0:06:58.440
out repository.

77
0:06:58.440 --> 0:07:02.720
In the next step then it's removing the git folders then it's removing the readme files

78
0:07:02.720 --> 0:07:11.880
and then it's creating the docuser sub directory so either in the docs sub folder or in the

79
0:07:11.880 --> 0:07:22.120
community sub folder with the target folder of the docs and the label and then it's copying

80
0:07:22.120 --> 0:07:31.720
all those files from A to B then it's removing all the stuff and then it's committing it

81
0:07:31.720 --> 0:07:42.480
directly to main so there is no pull requests it's pretty nice and then it's doing this

82
0:07:42.480 --> 0:07:50.920
not parallel but one after another and then it's taking roundabout for one repository

83
0:07:50.920 --> 0:07:58.760
it's taking about 10 seconds currently and the whole build process takes two minutes.

84
0:07:58.760 --> 0:08:07.520
Then there's the build workflow which is just standard NPM CI, NPM build and then it's being

85
0:08:07.520 --> 0:08:15.960
deployed to a static server and this is the result of it or documentation page.

86
0:08:15.960 --> 0:08:23.280
Where you see on the left side the docs that are currently distilled and part of the SDS

87
0:08:23.280 --> 0:08:28.320
documentation and this will of course grow because we are currently in the process of

88
0:08:28.320 --> 0:08:33.600
defining the standards and putting it all together so there will be a lot more than

89
0:08:33.600 --> 0:08:37.000
in the future.

90
0:08:37.000 --> 0:08:41.880
That's basically how we managed to do it and if you have ideas feedback critics then have

91
0:08:41.880 --> 0:08:48.080
a look at our repository and we are meeting up in the SIG documentation, special interest

92
0:08:48.080 --> 0:08:56.040
group documentation every second Tuesday from 11am central European time at you can have

93
0:08:56.040 --> 0:09:03.400
a look at the docs.scs.community page or scs.community page.

94
0:09:03.400 --> 0:09:08.640
What is still to come we are currently in the process of creating the whole framework

95
0:09:08.640 --> 0:09:14.120
so we are structure wise adapting towards the ATAXIS framework you might know it's

96
0:09:14.120 --> 0:09:21.080
I wouldn't call it framework but it's more like a text on me for writing excellent documentation

97
0:09:21.080 --> 0:09:27.040
and currently the workflows are triggered manually and yeah soon to be automated fully

98
0:09:27.040 --> 0:09:31.760
and there will also be interactive overview about the whole standards which worked out

99
0:09:31.760 --> 0:09:36.400
currently within the sovereign cloud stack community and there will be a fancy community

100
0:09:36.400 --> 0:09:39.800
space which is currently also in development.

101
0:09:39.800 --> 0:09:54.680
Thank you very much.

102
0:09:54.680 --> 0:09:55.680
Questions?

103
0:09:55.680 --> 0:10:00.840
Do you do releases of scs?

104
0:10:00.840 --> 0:10:01.840
Yes we do releases.

105
0:10:01.840 --> 0:10:06.800
Okay so how do you handle versions of documentation?

106
0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:13.560
We have we can if there will be a new version we will use the version versioning tool of

107
0:10:13.560 --> 0:10:23.520
docusaurus which is basically a command line command and then it packages all files and

108
0:10:23.520 --> 0:10:28.960
folders that is currently there and puts it into a version directory basically.

109
0:10:28.960 --> 0:10:38.920
There are no separate versions on the website for the documentation it's just the latest

110
0:10:38.920 --> 0:10:39.920
always on the website.

111
0:10:39.920 --> 0:10:44.520
No there will be there will be a future different version on the website.

112
0:10:44.520 --> 0:10:49.440
Okay yeah currently it's the latest.

113
0:10:49.440 --> 0:10:59.760
No there was a person first here.

114
0:10:59.760 --> 0:11:02.420
Thank you for this talk it's very informative.

115
0:11:02.420 --> 0:11:09.600
So my question is what was your documentation pain point that inspired you to say hey let's

116
0:11:09.600 --> 0:11:16.280
have a hackathon and let's put our documentation docusaurus and did you solve for those pain

117
0:11:16.280 --> 0:11:19.120
points using your workflow?

118
0:11:19.120 --> 0:11:21.200
Yeah actually thank you for a question.

119
0:11:21.200 --> 0:11:26.880
Actually the hackathon was planned prior to this so it was it was perfectly placed for

120
0:11:26.880 --> 0:11:34.160
us to solve this problem and the biggest problem was that no vendor wanted to change anything

121
0:11:34.160 --> 0:11:40.280
with their existing documentation so no metadata and and then the thing is with this workflow

122
0:11:40.280 --> 0:11:49.040
you don't have to manipulate the like external organizations documentation files or folders

123
0:11:49.040 --> 0:11:57.400
and you just can copy them distill them implement them and have like the navigational thing

124
0:11:57.400 --> 0:12:05.480
is only yeah we do it in with an hour repository so it's not it's minimal invasive basically

125
0:12:05.480 --> 0:12:10.840
or folks updating your documentation before you change platforms.

126
0:12:10.840 --> 0:12:20.800
I'm just not clear about what the problem was that was being solved.

127
0:12:20.800 --> 0:12:23.120
Yeah thank you for the talk as well.

128
0:12:23.120 --> 0:12:28.920
Just a question what are your input files I mean documentation appears in several formats

129
0:12:28.920 --> 0:12:33.800
for instance as part of c files where you have to extract it in to I don't know PDF

130
0:12:33.800 --> 0:12:35.840
or HTML or whatever.

131
0:12:35.840 --> 0:12:41.720
Yeah we are we are only accepting markdown files.

132
0:12:41.720 --> 0:12:47.400
And the problem the problem was that you have different vendors and for example if you if

133
0:12:47.400 --> 0:12:52.480
you want to pull all those markdown files and throw it into one folder then it's going

134
0:12:52.480 --> 0:13:01.640
to be a mess and so but we want to to curate how the docs is being built so that's the

135
0:13:01.640 --> 0:13:07.800
nice thing with docuSaurus you can define within the sidebars how you how your whole

136
0:13:07.800 --> 0:13:15.120
navigation is being built so you don't have meta data like lying directly in the vendor's

137
0:13:15.120 --> 0:13:25.880
target repository with the individual documentation.

138
0:13:25.880 --> 0:13:35.320
Any more questions.

139
0:13:35.320 --> 0:13:40.000
Do you plan to support any other documentation formats like askyi doc or r text or something

140
0:13:40.000 --> 0:13:45.480
like that you know like Sphinx is using askyi doc for example or more actually is you just

141
0:13:45.480 --> 0:13:46.720
restart your text.

142
0:13:46.720 --> 0:13:54.360
Yeah currently currently not but it would be possible to convert it in a separate workflow.

143
0:13:54.360 --> 0:14:04.800
OK but also we use markdown because there's also markdown linting process that's refining

144
0:14:04.800 --> 0:14:10.040
everything.

145
0:14:10.040 --> 0:14:13.360
Any more ideas.

146
0:14:13.360 --> 0:14:27.040
OK yeah thank you very much.
