1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
Okay.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:08.200
Thank you for being here.

3
0:00:08.200 --> 0:00:09.200
So good morning.

4
0:00:09.200 --> 0:00:10.760
My name is Daniel Mediado.

5
0:00:10.760 --> 0:00:13.080
I'm here today with my colleague Miguel.

6
0:00:13.080 --> 0:00:15.240
We are both principals of our engineers at Weihat.

7
0:00:15.240 --> 0:00:16.440
I'm currently working in the

8
0:00:16.440 --> 0:00:19.480
episode of the DTT team, basically monitoring.

9
0:00:19.480 --> 0:00:25.120
And he's on the OpenShift virtualization team.

10
0:00:25.120 --> 0:00:28.280
We just wanted to speak today a little bit about CNI, which stands for

11
0:00:28.280 --> 0:00:31.880
container network interface, which this is basically all the networking in

12
0:00:31.880 --> 0:00:34.840
Kubernetes, but not only limited to that.

13
0:00:34.840 --> 0:00:37.920
Because I think one of the things that this product lacks the most is

14
0:00:37.920 --> 0:00:41.560
documentation and how does this work, how you create a plugin, what are the

15
0:00:41.560 --> 0:00:42.560
primitives.

16
0:00:42.560 --> 0:00:45.400
I think that's something that is super simple, but there's little to

17
0:00:45.400 --> 0:00:47.280
no documentation besides the spec.

18
0:00:47.280 --> 0:00:48.960
So let's go walk through that.

19
0:00:48.960 --> 0:00:51.520
Yeah, this is a quick intro.

20
0:00:51.520 --> 0:00:55.200
So you may have been noticing that we are going to be speaking about

21
0:00:55.200 --> 0:00:57.560
CNI plugins change specifically.

22
0:00:57.560 --> 0:01:01.080
That means that we are going to be basically putting a couple of plugins

23
0:01:01.080 --> 0:01:02.080
in serial mode.

24
0:01:02.080 --> 0:01:06.640
But first of all, CNI stands for three different things and I want to be

25
0:01:06.640 --> 0:01:08.640
a little bit clearer here.

26
0:01:08.640 --> 0:01:12.080
You can have the CNI specification itself, which is a document.

27
0:01:12.080 --> 0:01:13.080
It's fine.

28
0:01:13.080 --> 0:01:14.080
You can read it.

29
0:01:14.080 --> 0:01:15.080
Then you've got the plugins.

30
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:18.480
So if you go to GitHub, you can see the CNI plugins.

31
0:01:18.480 --> 0:01:21.560
This is a set of plugins basically maintained by the community.

32
0:01:21.560 --> 0:01:24.120
Bridge, Mac, VLAM, you name it.

33
0:01:24.120 --> 0:01:25.960
There's a couple of those.

34
0:01:25.960 --> 0:01:29.280
The third thing, it may be just a couple of plugins.

35
0:01:29.280 --> 0:01:32.000
So those are basically the three things that you may be interested

36
0:01:32.000 --> 0:01:33.000
into.

37
0:01:33.000 --> 0:01:35.000
We are going to be always speaking about the plugins here in this

38
0:01:35.000 --> 0:01:39.040
session, but we'll be happily discussing anything after that.

39
0:01:39.040 --> 0:01:45.400
So just in case, I mean, here we are going to be speaking about Kubernetes,

40
0:01:45.400 --> 0:01:49.720
but let me take a note that the CNI specification on the plugins, they

41
0:01:49.720 --> 0:01:52.280
do work totally without Kubernetes.

42
0:01:52.280 --> 0:01:55.760
So with any runtime and time, SaaS rocket, and in fact, it started

43
0:01:55.760 --> 0:01:56.760
out with rocket.

44
0:01:56.760 --> 0:01:58.720
I guess Casey started that out.

45
0:01:58.720 --> 0:02:02.960
You can be running this out with cryo rocket, whatever you want to play

46
0:02:02.960 --> 0:02:03.960
with this.

47
0:02:03.960 --> 0:02:06.240
So what is the CNI plugin specifically?

48
0:02:06.240 --> 0:02:10.400
CNI plugins are binaries, which are basically copied over any of the

49
0:02:10.400 --> 0:02:15.480
hosts that are in your Kubernetes clusters.

50
0:02:15.480 --> 0:02:18.880
So if you want to install this out, you probably need a demo set to deploy

51
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:20.880
it on or do that manually.

52
0:02:20.880 --> 0:02:25.200
So here, who runs this CNI plugins?

53
0:02:25.200 --> 0:02:29.400
You could either run that yourself, but usually you would need to have

54
0:02:29.400 --> 0:02:31.080
the kubelet run those for you.

55
0:02:31.080 --> 0:02:34.360
Is there anybody here who doesn't know what a kubelet is?

56
0:02:34.360 --> 0:02:35.360
Okay.

57
0:02:35.360 --> 0:02:38.800
The kubelet, you fucker, anyway.

58
0:02:38.800 --> 0:02:39.800
They were trying me out.

59
0:02:39.800 --> 0:02:42.600
So anyways, I'll go ahead.

60
0:02:42.600 --> 0:02:46.640
So basically when you go and have the kubelet, which is a mystery thing

61
0:02:46.640 --> 0:02:50.720
that you don't know what it's about, runs the binary here in the host.

62
0:02:50.720 --> 0:02:56.040
It basically creates a network namespace, which is tied to a bf interface.

63
0:02:56.040 --> 0:02:58.880
As this guy doesn't know what a bf interface is, I'm going to be basically

64
0:02:58.880 --> 0:03:00.440
speaking out of that for him.

65
0:03:00.440 --> 0:03:04.640
So it's a bit trial point to point, you know, tunnel.

66
0:03:04.640 --> 0:03:07.200
You can basically hook this up into whatever you want to.

67
0:03:07.200 --> 0:03:11.840
Like usually these are connected to OVN, open bit sheets or whatever

68
0:03:11.840 --> 0:03:17.880
virtual streets or it depends on this CNI implementation.

69
0:03:17.880 --> 0:03:19.360
How do I configure the thing?

70
0:03:19.360 --> 0:03:23.080
These are usually configured by a configuration file.

71
0:03:23.080 --> 0:03:27.120
We're going to be speaking later on a little bit about how this changes.

72
0:03:27.120 --> 0:03:32.080
But yes, FYI, Miguel will be speaking later on about this more.

73
0:03:32.080 --> 0:03:38.360
Prior to the CNI specification 0.3.0, you weren't able to, you know, put your

74
0:03:38.360 --> 0:03:39.360
plugins in CNI mode.

75
0:03:39.360 --> 0:03:40.360
It would just break.

76
0:03:40.360 --> 0:03:44.880
So you would need to know basically there's a couple of CNI components

77
0:03:44.880 --> 0:03:45.960
that you need to put.

78
0:03:45.960 --> 0:03:49.920
Basically the name of your CNI plugin, the type, and the type should match

79
0:03:49.920 --> 0:03:54.240
the name of your binary or it would probably break afterwards.

80
0:03:54.240 --> 0:03:59.160
Then later on you need also some mbars which basically are specifically

81
0:03:59.160 --> 0:04:03.640
about telling you like okay, I can switch, but do I run this?

82
0:04:03.640 --> 0:04:06.480
Because it may be a bug or the bugs or whatever.

83
0:04:06.480 --> 0:04:11.560
If you put all this out, again recall a CNI plugin, it's a binary so you just

84
0:04:11.560 --> 0:04:13.960
run it as any binary you would run.

85
0:04:13.960 --> 0:04:18.360
It goes to your CNI plugin and then you can exit code.

86
0:04:18.360 --> 0:04:22.920
If you did your things right like that, this should be getting you an exit

87
0:04:22.920 --> 0:04:24.760
code 0, not error.

88
0:04:24.760 --> 0:04:28.600
And then you would be getting your standard out here which is just JSON.

89
0:04:28.600 --> 0:04:32.360
Why JSON and why not using the RPC and the daemon like everything in Kubernetes

90
0:04:32.360 --> 0:04:33.720
you may ask?

91
0:04:33.720 --> 0:04:38.440
Because again, this wasn't meant to be used on Kubernetes.

92
0:04:38.440 --> 0:04:42.480
If you get to stay at the more CNI working station, they'll probably be

93
0:04:42.480 --> 0:04:46.000
speaking about some point using the daemon for that too.

94
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:50.400
But here for the sake of this session, what you would need to remember here

95
0:04:50.400 --> 0:04:54.880
is this preps results basically and advancing some stuff later from my

96
0:04:54.880 --> 0:04:55.880
colleague.

97
0:04:55.880 --> 0:05:00.400
This is the previous results as per JSON at the plugin and if any plugin

98
0:05:00.400 --> 0:05:05.040
gets a previous result here, it should output the next one just in a serial

99
0:05:05.040 --> 0:05:08.840
mode way.

100
0:05:08.840 --> 0:05:11.480
I was speaking about the specification.

101
0:05:11.480 --> 0:05:13.080
What the hell is that?

102
0:05:13.080 --> 0:05:19.760
So if you're implementing your plugin, you need to make sure that it

103
0:05:19.760 --> 0:05:24.840
observes several primitives which is add, dell, check and version.

104
0:05:24.840 --> 0:05:30.320
So for instance, you may want to add a pod.

105
0:05:30.320 --> 0:05:33.040
I want to delete a pod network interface.

106
0:05:33.040 --> 0:05:36.960
And second version to be honest and even if the specification really

107
0:05:36.960 --> 0:05:42.640
requests you to honor this and observe this, they aren't really used by

108
0:05:42.640 --> 0:05:44.560
most of the commercial plugins.

109
0:05:44.560 --> 0:05:49.920
For instance, Celium, I guess they don't do any kind of tech, maybe version,

110
0:05:49.920 --> 0:05:54.560
but those aren't really needed and we'll be discussing that later on.

111
0:05:54.560 --> 0:05:59.240
So this is what a config file usually looks like.

112
0:05:59.240 --> 0:06:01.680
So this is nothing like a big deal.

113
0:06:01.680 --> 0:06:04.120
Super simple CNI version again.

114
0:06:04.120 --> 0:06:07.240
For example, I'm getting you backwards like with the things that we were

115
0:06:07.240 --> 0:06:08.760
speaking before.

116
0:06:08.760 --> 0:06:13.000
This one would work with CNI plugin sense because it's 0 to 1.

117
0:06:13.000 --> 0:06:16.440
If you put 0 to 0, it would basically fail miserably telling you that

118
0:06:16.440 --> 0:06:19.160
he hates you and it would crash.

119
0:06:19.160 --> 0:06:24.200
Then you got here the name, I don't care, but this type should match the name of

120
0:06:24.200 --> 0:06:26.520
your binary there later on.

121
0:06:26.520 --> 0:06:30.520
Then you can put out some plugin specific things that are, for instance, this

122
0:06:30.520 --> 0:06:35.800
basically comes from the bridge plugin which Michael will be showcasing later on.

123
0:06:35.800 --> 0:06:38.880
So you can put here, okay, this, what do I need for a bridge?

124
0:06:38.880 --> 0:06:39.880
I need the name.

125
0:06:39.880 --> 0:06:40.880
You see the default gateway.

126
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:44.800
I'm going to be forcing the address later on.

127
0:06:44.800 --> 0:06:48.240
This is a little bit special, but I won't be discussing that because you'll be

128
0:06:48.240 --> 0:06:52.800
seeing that later on in the conflict.

129
0:06:52.800 --> 0:06:59.520
Again, like, okay, so you told me about CNI plugins or binaries and also like

130
0:06:59.520 --> 0:07:00.960
our JSON configurations.

131
0:07:00.960 --> 0:07:03.160
So where do I store these things out?

132
0:07:03.160 --> 0:07:08.600
So basically when you define the cube of the configuration, you tell the CNI

133
0:07:08.600 --> 0:07:09.600
binary path.

134
0:07:09.600 --> 0:07:14.720
And by CNI binary path, it's just a directory where I store all the plugins.

135
0:07:14.720 --> 0:07:18.480
Sadly, there's little to no login in most of the plugins, so if something

136
0:07:18.480 --> 0:07:21.480
breaks you would have to go and see what's going on here.

137
0:07:21.480 --> 0:07:26.720
So you would just go, one of the things that usually fail the most is just like

138
0:07:26.720 --> 0:07:29.800
you don't have the binary here installed and it would fail until you use the

139
0:07:29.800 --> 0:07:30.800
H2N.

140
0:07:30.800 --> 0:07:35.000
And the config directory is here and you just have a couple of JSON who maps to

141
0:07:35.000 --> 0:07:40.240
the name of the binaries usually and where you put the specific plugin configs.

142
0:07:40.240 --> 0:07:44.440
Plugging chains, let's go for that.

143
0:07:44.440 --> 0:07:46.560
So that's the big deal.

144
0:07:46.560 --> 0:07:51.280
Again, available since CNI or CO2 zero.

145
0:07:51.280 --> 0:07:56.960
Those are required since the version one because now everything is the same, even

146
0:07:56.960 --> 0:07:59.720
if it's just a single plugin and everything is accomplished.

147
0:07:59.720 --> 0:08:03.200
Again, even if it's just a single plugin.

148
0:08:03.200 --> 0:08:08.440
So if you just want to put the things from the old way, it would just break.

149
0:08:08.440 --> 0:08:11.840
I was also pointing out that now let's assume that you've got a couple of plugins

150
0:08:11.840 --> 0:08:13.480
here like Abinell.

151
0:08:13.480 --> 0:08:18.040
You've got the Bricks plugin, then you've got Abinell Firewall plugin, which is

152
0:08:18.040 --> 0:08:21.480
one of the most useful use cases for this.

153
0:08:21.480 --> 0:08:25.760
And then Abinell, let's say put a couple of plugins, bandwidth, Abinell, Abinell,

154
0:08:25.760 --> 0:08:30.680
Abinell Firewall because I like to and I am going to be putting Abinell in another

155
0:08:30.680 --> 0:08:32.640
Macmill interface here.

156
0:08:32.640 --> 0:08:38.120
So all these plugins are expected to honor that they are going to be passing the

157
0:08:38.120 --> 0:08:40.600
properties to each other.

158
0:08:40.600 --> 0:08:43.840
So even if they don't know anything about what comes before, because the

159
0:08:43.840 --> 0:08:47.880
Bricks plugin will know how to make a Bricks, but the Macmillan plugin won't.

160
0:08:47.880 --> 0:08:52.080
So everything comes through the plugins, all the info goes through using prep results

161
0:08:52.080 --> 0:08:59.480
and we'll be showing you later on with the demo if it doesn't fail.

162
0:08:59.480 --> 0:09:04.840
This is the config, this is not a config for CNI plugin, this is a conf list.

163
0:09:04.840 --> 0:09:08.320
So if you see this pretty much resembles what you had in the config file for a plugin

164
0:09:08.320 --> 0:09:14.560
like before, so now we got CNI version, okay, I know I'm guessing this a lot, but it

165
0:09:14.560 --> 0:09:18.280
should be greater than three of these here, otherwise this would just break.

166
0:09:18.280 --> 0:09:22.440
This is your conf list and then you get basically a list of plugins.

167
0:09:22.440 --> 0:09:28.120
Instead of one, we got a few of those and those would be just working together.

168
0:09:28.120 --> 0:09:33.200
So in this case, we got a name because all the plugins would need a name and would need

169
0:09:33.200 --> 0:09:37.520
a tie which would match the binary and then we got the specific configurations.

170
0:09:37.520 --> 0:09:43.400
So in the demo, we'll be showing you how these plugins get to link with the prep results

171
0:09:43.400 --> 0:09:44.880
and so forth.

172
0:09:44.880 --> 0:09:51.360
But if you see, it's just a list of plugins with name, type and then specific configurations.

173
0:09:51.360 --> 0:09:57.440
But if you just want to do something, okay, I'm buying this, I want to create my own plugin,

174
0:09:57.440 --> 0:10:01.560
you probably need a name and type even if it doesn't do anything.

175
0:10:01.560 --> 0:10:04.600
Okay, go ahead.

176
0:10:04.600 --> 0:10:09.480
Now use cases and then I guess I spoke maybe a little bit too much and even if we are late

177
0:10:09.480 --> 0:10:13.400
because we could have rushed to the airport to that, but I'm handing over to Michael Miguel

178
0:10:13.400 --> 0:10:18.040
who's going to be showing you this a little bit around and then if it works again, demo.

179
0:10:18.040 --> 0:10:20.040
Go ahead, Miguel.

180
0:10:20.040 --> 0:10:21.040
Hello?

181
0:10:21.040 --> 0:10:23.800
Well, I'll use this.

182
0:10:23.800 --> 0:10:32.320
So this is like a list of the plugins that are provided by the CNI maintainers and are

183
0:10:32.320 --> 0:10:36.160
available on the container networking slash plugins repository.

184
0:10:36.160 --> 0:10:38.720
So the first is tuning CNI.

185
0:10:38.720 --> 0:10:42.560
It allows you to configure like a list of syscuttle.

186
0:10:42.560 --> 0:10:47.800
So if you need some syscuttle to happen inside of your pod, you use this tuning CNI.

187
0:10:47.800 --> 0:10:53.120
The bandwidth CNI as the name implies, like quite evident, what it does is to throttle

188
0:10:53.120 --> 0:10:57.000
either the ingress or egress traffic to your pod.

189
0:10:57.000 --> 0:11:02.160
If you want to do those kinds of things, the firewall plugin, what it does is only allow

190
0:11:02.160 --> 0:11:08.840
access to and from the IP addresses that are referenced in the results that the plugin

191
0:11:08.840 --> 0:11:14.800
got, for instance, and the port mapping as the, well, the name kind of implies it, well,

192
0:11:14.800 --> 0:11:21.680
does port forwarding configures port forwarding from the host into the container for the set

193
0:11:21.680 --> 0:11:26.560
of ports that you specify in the configuration.

194
0:11:26.560 --> 0:11:32.400
Now having said this, let's go to the demo and I'm now wondering how can I do this while

195
0:11:32.400 --> 0:11:34.960
holding the microphone.

196
0:11:34.960 --> 0:11:35.960
This doesn't work.

197
0:11:35.960 --> 0:11:36.960
I think.

198
0:11:36.960 --> 0:11:37.960
Yeah, go ahead.

199
0:11:37.960 --> 0:11:38.960
No, I do like.

200
0:11:38.960 --> 0:11:39.960
Of course, of course.

201
0:11:39.960 --> 0:11:40.960
Really sorry.

202
0:11:40.960 --> 0:11:41.960
Right.

203
0:11:41.960 --> 0:11:42.960
Okay.

204
0:11:42.960 --> 0:11:43.960
Okay.

205
0:11:43.960 --> 0:11:44.960
Okay.

206
0:11:44.960 --> 0:11:45.960
Awesome.

207
0:11:45.960 --> 0:11:46.960
Easy.

208
0:11:46.960 --> 0:11:47.960
Okay.

209
0:11:47.960 --> 0:11:56.400
So the first thing that I should mention, like Daniel, like reference Kubernetes a lot

210
0:11:56.400 --> 0:12:04.640
like, but please remember that CNI is more is like Kubernetes is a user of CNI.

211
0:12:04.640 --> 0:12:08.680
Like it's not that you can use CNI by itself.

212
0:12:08.680 --> 0:12:13.040
And as such, we're going to be using something called CNI tool.

213
0:12:13.040 --> 0:12:20.760
It's just a binary that you point at your, at a certain CNI binary and give it like a

214
0:12:20.760 --> 0:12:26.960
set of environment variables, the plugins configuration via standard then as Daniel

215
0:12:26.960 --> 0:12:30.960
said before, like you basically pass the configuration of the plugins.

216
0:12:30.960 --> 0:12:36.640
You give it the input parameters, which are the environment variables and you execute

217
0:12:36.640 --> 0:12:37.640
the binary.

218
0:12:37.640 --> 0:12:42.960
And this is how we're going to be seeing the demo.

219
0:12:42.960 --> 0:12:49.840
You can follow it on this on this link, but yeah, the first thing I think I should explain

220
0:12:49.840 --> 0:12:52.400
is like the scenario we're trying to achieve.

221
0:12:52.400 --> 0:12:56.400
And this can be seen here in the bottom right corner.

222
0:12:56.400 --> 0:12:57.960
So very simple thing.

223
0:12:57.960 --> 0:13:04.460
We just want to have like a bridge to namespace is interconnected via this bridge.

224
0:13:04.460 --> 0:13:10.160
And we're going to be configuring a static IP on a static IP addresses on each of the

225
0:13:10.160 --> 0:13:11.160
namespaces.

226
0:13:11.160 --> 0:13:15.680
And then we'll run a sniper from the client to the, to the server.

227
0:13:15.680 --> 0:13:19.000
And we're going to see how it fares.

228
0:13:19.000 --> 0:13:23.960
So first I also need to show you the configuration that I'm using for this.

229
0:13:23.960 --> 0:13:24.960
Okay.

230
0:13:24.960 --> 0:13:26.480
It's this one.

231
0:13:26.480 --> 0:13:29.840
And this is the configuration that we're going to be using to achieve this scenario.

232
0:13:29.840 --> 0:13:32.540
Like we're going to be using the plugin of type bridge.

233
0:13:32.540 --> 0:13:37.080
This is the name of the binary that will be invoked on the host to create the bridge.

234
0:13:37.080 --> 0:13:38.560
Give it the name.

235
0:13:38.560 --> 0:13:44.080
We enable the IP's capability so you can put a static IP in it and you tell it that you

236
0:13:44.080 --> 0:13:46.440
want static IP.

237
0:13:46.440 --> 0:13:49.760
And that's pretty much the configuration that you need to give it.

238
0:13:49.760 --> 0:13:53.120
So let's just run the example.

239
0:13:53.120 --> 0:13:55.520
Okay.

240
0:13:55.520 --> 0:13:58.200
Like this parameter here that you see, can you see it?

241
0:13:58.200 --> 0:13:59.800
Oh, it's like the font big enough.

242
0:13:59.800 --> 0:14:00.800
It's good.

243
0:14:00.800 --> 0:14:01.800
Okay.

244
0:14:01.800 --> 0:14:02.800
Thanks.

245
0:14:02.800 --> 0:14:05.120
Like you have to give this like the name of the configuration.

246
0:14:05.120 --> 0:14:10.840
If you see like unlimited bandwidth, it's the attribute here on the upper left corner

247
0:14:10.840 --> 0:14:12.000
that you see under name.

248
0:14:12.000 --> 0:14:13.240
It's the same thing.

249
0:14:13.240 --> 0:14:15.020
It must match.

250
0:14:15.020 --> 0:14:20.720
And now this configured the scenario and it's now running the IPOS session between the both

251
0:14:20.720 --> 0:14:22.180
the client and the server.

252
0:14:22.180 --> 0:14:28.160
And as you see, we're getting like a very big bit rate of around 60 gigabits per second.

253
0:14:28.160 --> 0:14:31.920
So this is with a straight configuration.

254
0:14:31.920 --> 0:14:39.240
Now let's use a different configuration where we put, we use the first configuration, but

255
0:14:39.240 --> 0:14:40.480
we use it in a chain.

256
0:14:40.480 --> 0:14:44.360
And afterwards we put like the bandwidth plugin.

257
0:14:44.360 --> 0:14:51.920
Again, what this does, it will throttle the input traffic into the network interface of

258
0:14:51.920 --> 0:14:54.080
both namespaces.

259
0:14:54.080 --> 0:15:01.920
So we're going to be doing the exact same thing, but with this different configuration

260
0:15:01.920 --> 0:15:05.000
and bandwidth limiter.

261
0:15:05.000 --> 0:15:09.980
And as we see, like the bit rate that we're getting is literally a lot less and it should

262
0:15:09.980 --> 0:15:15.160
map somehow to the values that we've configured here.

263
0:15:15.160 --> 0:15:19.740
So what this shows is that you can use like this bandwidth plugin in a chain in order

264
0:15:19.740 --> 0:15:22.500
to achieve a different use case than you had before.

265
0:15:22.500 --> 0:15:28.280
Like you want to throttle traffic to this, you use this type of plugin.

266
0:15:28.280 --> 0:15:30.440
I think that's, let me just check the time.

267
0:15:30.440 --> 0:15:31.440
Yeah, we're good.

268
0:15:31.440 --> 0:15:33.200
Still have 10 minutes.

269
0:15:33.200 --> 0:15:37.200
So let's run the second.

270
0:15:37.200 --> 0:15:41.360
The second demo we had, we have actually, sorry.

271
0:15:41.360 --> 0:15:42.360
Okay.

272
0:15:42.360 --> 0:15:45.400
The scenario is a lot simpler this time.

273
0:15:45.400 --> 0:15:49.520
Like we just have the same bridge as before, but we just have like a network namespace

274
0:15:49.520 --> 0:15:51.360
connected to it.

275
0:15:51.360 --> 0:15:59.020
And what we're going to be doing is showing you how the chain actually works, focusing

276
0:15:59.020 --> 0:16:05.320
on the, on what Daniel said before, like you need to handle always the previous result

277
0:16:05.320 --> 0:16:10.720
and you need to account for it and you need to pass it along the chain continuously.

278
0:16:10.720 --> 0:16:12.760
And okay.

279
0:16:12.760 --> 0:16:16.880
Let's just show the configuration of this plugin.

280
0:16:16.880 --> 0:16:22.640
So this chain might look a lot more complex than the one before because it has more things

281
0:16:22.640 --> 0:16:24.680
in it, but it's very, very, very simple.

282
0:16:24.680 --> 0:16:27.780
So this thing first will, and it will call the bridge plugin.

283
0:16:27.780 --> 0:16:30.120
It will create the bridge.

284
0:16:30.120 --> 0:16:35.720
Then we'll invoke the debug CNI, like this CNI plugin is very, very simple.

285
0:16:35.720 --> 0:16:39.720
The only thing it does is print the result it got from the previous plugin.

286
0:16:39.720 --> 0:16:43.920
So what we're going to be seeing is here is the result of the first plugin in the chain.

287
0:16:43.920 --> 0:16:47.320
Afterwards, we run the tuning CNI plugin.

288
0:16:47.320 --> 0:16:52.440
And what we're going to do is to change the MAC address that we got on the interface of

289
0:16:52.440 --> 0:16:55.120
this dummy namespace that we see here.

290
0:16:55.120 --> 0:16:57.900
So the idea is we first run the bridge plugin.

291
0:16:57.900 --> 0:17:04.240
This thing will assign a random MAC address to the interface that is on this namespace.

292
0:17:04.240 --> 0:17:05.240
We'll print that.

293
0:17:05.240 --> 0:17:08.600
We'll run tuning to change that MAC address.

294
0:17:08.600 --> 0:17:13.840
And we're going to print that again to see like the result of the previous plugin.

295
0:17:13.840 --> 0:17:15.880
And that's pretty much it.

296
0:17:15.880 --> 0:17:22.880
Let's just run the example and show you what I actually mean.

297
0:17:22.880 --> 0:17:29.240
So here we see like...

298
0:17:29.240 --> 0:17:37.200
So this log here is the result of the first call of the debug CNI.

299
0:17:37.200 --> 0:17:44.000
And as we see in the pods, in what would be the pod interface, which is identified by

300
0:17:44.000 --> 0:17:48.640
this attribute sandbox that points to the name of the namespace or actually to the path

301
0:17:48.640 --> 0:17:53.720
of the namespace, we see that in its result we have the interface name that was created

302
0:17:53.720 --> 0:17:56.600
on that network namespace.

303
0:17:56.600 --> 0:18:01.440
And we see that it was assigned like a random MAC address that is identified here.

304
0:18:01.440 --> 0:18:04.920
We then run the tuning plugin that changed this MAC address.

305
0:18:04.920 --> 0:18:08.160
And we finally printed the previous result again.

306
0:18:08.160 --> 0:18:17.080
And we see that this changed to the MAC address that we specified statically in the plugin

307
0:18:17.080 --> 0:18:21.040
configuration, which is exactly what we wanted to show.

308
0:18:21.040 --> 0:18:28.440
Like that's like very simple demo, but I think it kind of illustrates in a very neat way

309
0:18:28.440 --> 0:18:34.840
how chaining actually works in a step-by-step manner.

310
0:18:34.840 --> 0:18:39.240
And with this, we arrived at the conclusions.

311
0:18:39.240 --> 0:18:46.220
And I'd like to basically tell you again what we just told you, like focusing on the most

312
0:18:46.220 --> 0:18:49.960
important things that we think are about this.

313
0:18:49.960 --> 0:18:54.440
First thing is like these plugins, remember what they do.

314
0:18:54.440 --> 0:19:00.140
They add more stuff to the pod, so they enable different use cases.

315
0:19:00.140 --> 0:19:02.080
You can prevent IP spoofing.

316
0:19:02.080 --> 0:19:04.380
You can throttle bandwidth, as we've seen.

317
0:19:04.380 --> 0:19:08.240
You can configure port forwarding from the host to different containers.

318
0:19:08.240 --> 0:19:12.040
You can configure differences cuddles.

319
0:19:12.040 --> 0:19:18.360
And actually, you can also create an allow list of the syscuddles that you can use inside

320
0:19:18.360 --> 0:19:20.760
of the pod.

321
0:19:20.760 --> 0:19:30.160
And finally, I think like if you have to keep one thing from this presentation is that a

322
0:19:30.160 --> 0:19:34.760
meta plugin must always handle the result of the previous plugin.

323
0:19:34.760 --> 0:19:40.400
Like you need to account for it, first of all, because you don't know if you're a plugin,

324
0:19:40.400 --> 0:19:43.000
you don't know if anything will run after you in a chain.

325
0:19:43.000 --> 0:19:46.200
Like the user will configure it, so you don't know what's going to happen afterwards.

326
0:19:46.200 --> 0:19:48.120
So you need to send a result.

327
0:19:48.120 --> 0:19:52.640
And if you're somewhere in the middle of the chain, least you can do or least you must

328
0:19:52.640 --> 0:19:59.960
do is grab the result you got from the previous one and echo it into the next one.

329
0:19:59.960 --> 0:20:05.280
Now finally, remember that two things.

330
0:20:05.280 --> 0:20:11.480
Chain chains are only allowed starting from CNI 0.3.

331
0:20:11.480 --> 0:20:16.840
And they're the only configuration type allowed starting from CNI version 1.0.

332
0:20:16.840 --> 0:20:24.240
Like if you use the first configuration example we've shown on CNI 1.0, it wouldn't work.

333
0:20:24.240 --> 0:20:26.880
It will explode, it will fail, make you miserable.

334
0:20:26.880 --> 0:20:34.200
And the idea here is know your previous result always because that's probably the most information

335
0:20:34.200 --> 0:20:37.000
you'll get from anything that ran before you.

336
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:43.720
Like as Daniel said, logging is clearly not the thing that's most prevalent on, at least

337
0:20:43.720 --> 0:20:50.600
on the plugins that are maintained by the CNI maintainers.

338
0:20:50.600 --> 0:20:53.480
And yeah, this concludes our talk.

339
0:20:53.480 --> 0:20:55.720
Thanks a lot, guys.

340
0:20:55.720 --> 0:20:56.720
Questions?

341
0:20:56.720 --> 0:21:06.520
Thank you.

342
0:21:06.520 --> 0:21:07.520
Thank you.

343
0:21:07.520 --> 0:21:11.960
Can you tell a little more about use cases of CNI without Kubernetes?

344
0:21:11.960 --> 0:21:12.960
Okay.

345
0:21:12.960 --> 0:21:15.600
That's a really good question.

346
0:21:15.600 --> 0:21:18.040
And it's going to probably eat all the time that we have.

347
0:21:18.040 --> 0:21:21.280
Like I can, like I work for Kubernetes.

348
0:21:21.280 --> 0:21:27.880
And one thing we do in it is, so there's a pod and inside the pod you run a virtual machine

349
0:21:27.880 --> 0:21:29.000
in it.

350
0:21:29.000 --> 0:21:33.960
Now CNI, what it does is configure the pod interface, but what you want to have is like

351
0:21:33.960 --> 0:21:35.600
networking inside of the VM.

352
0:21:35.600 --> 0:21:40.920
Like you need some way to get like the extended connectivity from the pod, from the pod interface

353
0:21:40.920 --> 0:21:42.440
and into the VM.

354
0:21:42.440 --> 0:21:43.960
You need to have something there.

355
0:21:43.960 --> 0:21:48.720
And we have code in our code base, in the Kubernetes code base to achieve this.

356
0:21:48.720 --> 0:21:54.440
Like one of the thing we could do using CNI chains is to all flow that entire code to

357
0:21:54.440 --> 0:21:59.440
CNI plugins that would create, for instance, the bridge that you have inside of the pod

358
0:21:59.440 --> 0:22:04.760
to extend that connectivity that would create the tap device from which the VM would create

359
0:22:04.760 --> 0:22:07.400
the emulated network device from.

360
0:22:07.400 --> 0:22:12.760
So I really think this could be modelled using CNI.

361
0:22:12.760 --> 0:22:14.480
That's something we still need to see.

362
0:22:14.480 --> 0:22:20.040
Like it's a very rough idea yet, but it's an example, I think.

363
0:22:20.040 --> 0:22:23.480
Now somebody says that I guess the quickest one is, as you know, he was mentioning CNI

364
0:22:23.480 --> 0:22:24.480
tools.

365
0:22:24.480 --> 0:22:28.080
CNI tool is just used to develop CNI plugins and it doesn't have Kubernetes at all.

366
0:22:28.080 --> 0:22:31.440
And you can see that the plugins don't have to run there.

367
0:22:31.440 --> 0:22:34.440
Even that rocket, so rocket, it was on its own.

368
0:22:34.440 --> 0:22:36.280
It didn't have to use Kubernetes at all.

369
0:22:36.280 --> 0:22:39.400
And it's where most of CNI plugins were originally developed.

370
0:22:39.400 --> 0:22:42.560
Just put any kind of, you know, random engine and it would work.

371
0:22:42.560 --> 0:22:49.040
No Kubernetes needed.

372
0:22:49.040 --> 0:22:54.040
So if I have a CNI plugin that sets up some external state, for example, a firewall that

373
0:22:54.040 --> 0:22:58.800
might even be a separate device, and something goes wrong and I lose the delete, how do I

374
0:22:58.800 --> 0:23:00.360
recover from that?

375
0:23:00.360 --> 0:23:02.240
So that's an amazing question.

376
0:23:02.240 --> 0:23:10.640
Like you need all, like you must design everything assuming that CNI deletes will be missed.

377
0:23:10.640 --> 0:23:12.840
Like it might happen like all the time.

378
0:23:12.840 --> 0:23:19.240
So you need to have a reconcile loops of sorts that knows about your state, relevant state,

379
0:23:19.240 --> 0:23:21.160
and reconcile this somehow.

380
0:23:21.160 --> 0:23:25.760
But I didn't see a way to even check if the state should still be active.

381
0:23:25.760 --> 0:23:29.560
How does my CNI plugin know that something is still there?

382
0:23:29.560 --> 0:23:30.560
It's clueless.

383
0:23:30.560 --> 0:23:38.600
Like you need to like, I don't know, like to monitor this little kid and assume that

384
0:23:38.600 --> 0:23:42.840
he will not fall and hit the head in the corner of the table.

385
0:23:42.840 --> 0:23:45.440
You need to do that out of bend.

386
0:23:45.440 --> 0:23:49.360
Like it's not designed to allow for that.

387
0:23:49.360 --> 0:23:51.360
I'm sorry.

388
0:23:51.360 --> 0:23:53.480
Hi.

389
0:23:53.480 --> 0:23:59.320
During the presentation you mentioned that some CNI plugin like Selium, but I guess that

390
0:23:59.320 --> 0:24:03.840
you were also mentioning other plugins, they're not doing the loggings and they're not using

391
0:24:03.840 --> 0:24:04.840
the entire APIs.

392
0:24:04.840 --> 0:24:05.840
How comes?

393
0:24:05.840 --> 0:24:08.880
I mean, it kind of depends on your CNI.

394
0:24:08.880 --> 0:24:09.880
I guess you hear me.

395
0:24:09.880 --> 0:24:10.880
It's okay?

396
0:24:10.880 --> 0:24:13.480
So it kind of depends on your CNI plugin implementation.

397
0:24:13.480 --> 0:24:18.600
So for instance, some CNI do implement logging, but it's not something that is within the

398
0:24:18.600 --> 0:24:20.160
implementation itself at all.

399
0:24:20.160 --> 0:24:24.400
So you may be totally fine doing no logging at all, but then go back to debugging it so

400
0:24:24.400 --> 0:24:30.080
you have to go to the kubectl, you have to go to Cribal Labs, and then go back to debugging

401
0:24:30.080 --> 0:24:31.200
all those.

402
0:24:31.200 --> 0:24:36.800
So it depends on your implementation, for instance, that which is here, he implements

403
0:24:36.800 --> 0:24:41.520
some of his logging for inamulties and so forth, but that's not something that is on

404
0:24:41.520 --> 0:24:42.520
every plugin.

405
0:24:42.520 --> 0:24:45.640
For sure it's not in any of the community-maintained ones.

406
0:24:45.640 --> 0:24:48.040
Okay, thanks.

407
0:24:48.040 --> 0:24:50.040
Any more questions?

408
0:24:50.040 --> 0:24:55.280
Well, thanks a lot for your time and for listening to us, and bye-bye.

409
0:24:55.280 --> 0:24:56.280
Enjoy the question.

410
0:24:56.280 --> 0:25:02.720
Thank you.
