WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.840
Okay, so basically we had this extra slot of time in our physical session.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.240
Actually, the, well, we want to use that time to engage the session with you, the audience,

00:21.240 --> 00:27.760
about this open research track here at FOSDEM.

00:27.760 --> 00:38.160
Before opening the stage for basically questions and discussions, just wanted to very briefly

00:38.160 --> 00:43.800
say a few words about how we ended up creating this space.

00:43.800 --> 00:49.600
So basically we've been with a few colleagues at S

00:49.600 --> 00:57.720
Poppari, for instance, doing a few conferences here at FOSDEM in other dev rooms, using this

00:57.720 --> 01:03.360
FOSDEM conference as a venue to actually talk about technical realizations we were doing

01:03.360 --> 01:05.120
in the lab.

01:05.120 --> 01:11.840
And it was not so, it was a very good opportunity for us because it's not easy to do a scientific

01:11.840 --> 01:18.360
publication about technical things, more specifically into the social sciences.

01:18.360 --> 01:25.680
So after a few years of doing that, we thought that actually we could try to go a step further

01:25.680 --> 01:32.560
on this by organizing this track, which is definitely about open source software and

01:32.560 --> 01:34.560
research.

01:34.560 --> 01:40.480
And so we had, as you've seen, we understand research with a very broad way.

01:40.480 --> 01:47.440
Any kind of inquiry is, we think, interesting to discuss because the share, a journalist

01:47.440 --> 01:56.480
investigator, we had an open factor, for instance, our social scientists, our natural scientists,

01:56.480 --> 02:01.200
all share kind of the same engagement with data about inquiry.

02:01.200 --> 02:06.160
So we created this room four years ago.

02:06.160 --> 02:12.320
Actually at the time we merged with another initiative from two people from neuroscience.

02:12.320 --> 02:18.760
And it was nice also to have these different disciplines.

02:18.760 --> 02:25.720
Of course, then the COVID came, so we succeeded into keeping the room online.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.880
And now, so we have a crew of five, six people.

02:30.880 --> 02:40.080
We have two people who are online, Yohudi and Celia Grison-Daniel, who will actually

02:40.080 --> 02:48.280
monitor from their home the online session, which will start in 20 minutes.

02:48.280 --> 02:54.520
And basically we are a bunch of people working in academia or not, or in an open knowledge

02:54.520 --> 02:56.480
foundation.

02:56.480 --> 03:00.000
And I have no more in academia myself.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.960
And so the first thing I would like to say is like volunteers to help us out organizing

03:07.960 --> 03:11.960
this space are more than welcome.

03:11.960 --> 03:18.640
Basically the work of this starts in the autumn where we submit a proposal to first them to

03:18.640 --> 03:20.360
organize this room again.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.720
So each year we do that.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.720
We wait for the answer.

03:22.720 --> 03:27.880
And once we have it, we have to do a call of proposal for something very, very classic

03:27.880 --> 03:31.360
about organizing a conference.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.880
So reviewing papers, actually getting the papers in.

03:34.880 --> 03:41.480
So we actually contact people for asking them to come to our conference.

03:41.480 --> 03:46.360
And then, as you've seen, what we did today, mining the door, putting signs on people and

03:46.360 --> 03:50.600
that kind of stuff, which is fun.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.160
And yeah, so I will finish with that.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.480
And maybe some other people won't say other things.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
I will finish this with one thing.

03:57.480 --> 04:07.200
The other thing is it's important for us to try to augment diversity of our group.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.600
Gender but also disciplines.

04:08.600 --> 04:14.680
We'd like to open up as much discipline as we can.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.680
So yeah.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.680
Sorry?

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
Less French people.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.600
Less, yeah, and diversity.

04:20.600 --> 04:24.560
So there is a question about, yes, yes, also less French people.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.000
We tried that, we succeeded a little bit, but not that much.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
So yes, please.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Matthew.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.880
Yeah, I just wanted to say a few things.

04:33.880 --> 04:41.920
But basically, the reason we need you is also to increase this diversity in the papers submitted.

04:41.920 --> 04:46.960
Because for instance, if you look at the gender balance, the committee is basically gender

04:46.960 --> 04:48.960
balanced.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.260
But the submissions are completely dominated by males.

04:53.260 --> 05:02.680
And also, the deaf room in the beginning had one leg firmly into the hard sciences.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.720
But then we've kind of drifted towards the social sciences.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.760
And it's not just us, it's also the demand.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.240
So we try to prompt something.

05:10.240 --> 05:18.440
But it's kind of a balance game to try to have this variety in the proposals in the

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
first place.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.440
Because if we don't have any proposition, for instance, in hard sciences, we're not

05:24.440 --> 05:25.800
going to have any.

05:25.800 --> 05:32.680
So the audience, which is like, if you submit papers, or if you come to the committee and

05:32.680 --> 05:38.560
then become a bridge to contact other people to submit papers, that's how we can kind of

05:38.560 --> 05:42.200
ensure that it remains diverse.

05:42.200 --> 05:49.120
It's not a lot of work to participate, also because we are many, and we are probably going

05:49.120 --> 05:50.600
to get even more people.

05:50.600 --> 05:58.120
And it's not a problem to be many, because the real job beyond managing the day is, as

05:58.120 --> 06:02.560
you said, to contact the people and then to review, but mostly to contact them.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.120
So please come in and join us about that.

06:06.120 --> 06:10.520
But we could also have this discussion about what the scope of that should be.

06:10.520 --> 06:15.320
Because I think that the figure of the tool maker was kind of at the center of what we

06:15.320 --> 06:17.400
had in mind.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.640
But as we see, it's not just about tools.

06:19.640 --> 06:25.200
It can also be about infrastructure in ways that is not tools, like institutions.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.200
I don't know.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.720
I'm thinking of the journal of open source software that we had a few years back.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.760
Infrastructure is not just tools.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.760
So now it's clear.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.040
It's not just the tool makers.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.840
They said the infrastructure maker.

06:36.840 --> 06:42.280
And what could it be like common and shape the profile of the room with us?

06:42.280 --> 06:51.080
Can I just to emphasize what you said, can I just share my experience from this?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
Go ahead.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
Take the mic.

06:53.080 --> 07:00.080
Since my first time at First

07:00.080 --> 07:01.080
Time, and I went to talk about it.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.680
But just to emphasize what Matt just said, this was my first time at First Time.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.680
And as I told you, I'm not a coder.

07:05.680 --> 07:12.400
So I was pretty scared about what I was going to say and share, et cetera, et cetera.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.720
So please do it.

07:14.720 --> 07:22.560
Because why I came here was to share knowledge, of course, but to retrieve some different

07:22.560 --> 07:29.440
experience from what I do every day and who the people are with whom I work every day.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.680
So thank you for this.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.160
And please submit papers.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.280
Yeah.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.280
You want the mic?

07:41.280 --> 07:42.280
Yeah.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.280
Yeah.

07:43.280 --> 08:04.320
I think one challenge for the diversity is that there's also the good way to use open

08:04.320 --> 08:12.960
ITK solutions and design on them.

08:12.960 --> 08:27.900
And it's about how we can find how to tweak a real type of

08:27.900 --> 08:30.900
hey, we also use Excel.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.980
It's sort of a bad thing for a practice

08:32.980 --> 08:36.140
that people look at strangely, or even if it's

08:36.140 --> 08:39.260
like LibreOffice, which I think is a good source.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.140
But it's not the death wave.

08:41.140 --> 08:46.960
And I guess that vibe that people catch that

08:46.960 --> 08:48.460
would make also a lot of people that

08:48.460 --> 08:51.220
would be very interesting for this community

08:51.220 --> 08:55.340
to also see how it's done in the real world in a very messy way

08:55.340 --> 08:57.840
very often.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.340
So may stem not by that.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.300
And if we could get to a place where this would be legit

09:04.300 --> 09:07.140
and people would be curious and interested

09:07.140 --> 09:12.900
in those non-perfect, chaotic, and not 100% open source ways,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.860
I think that would increase diversity law.

09:15.860 --> 09:19.300
So just for the stream, the idea that a challenge to diversity

09:19.300 --> 09:21.840
could be that there are good ways and bad ways

09:21.840 --> 09:24.120
to do open source.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.460
And where I say that, I forgot the last part of your speech.

09:27.460 --> 09:32.140
The Excel LibreOffice part is important.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.300
He's going to come back later.

09:33.300 --> 09:33.800
I'm sorry.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.140
I'm so tired.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.740
It was for the stream.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.300
Yeah, that's what the point was.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.860
But I mean, you were very right that it's about us

09:41.860 --> 09:43.740
to cultivate that.

09:43.740 --> 09:45.700
Yeah, it comes back to me now.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.780
It's really important to show how

09:47.780 --> 09:50.580
it's being done in the real world.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.700
That's something that I think we all

09:52.700 --> 09:55.060
appreciate very much about the first dimension in general.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.780
You don't see some people talking from a distance

09:57.780 --> 09:59.380
about how it's supposed to be.

09:59.380 --> 10:03.460
You have real people who are from actually doing stuff, which

10:03.460 --> 10:05.100
also means that sometimes they are not

10:05.100 --> 10:06.540
really good at communicating.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.460
And that's something that I really appreciate,

10:08.460 --> 10:10.900
because you hear the voices.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.580
I think the first dimension is somehow a safe space for people

10:13.580 --> 10:16.260
who are not primarily good at communicating,

10:16.260 --> 10:18.220
contrary to academics, for instance,

10:18.220 --> 10:20.700
but who are really doing the stuff.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.460
And we can hear them.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.300
And we can identify to them and realize

10:25.300 --> 10:29.300
that anyone can get involved in open science and open source

10:29.300 --> 10:29.820
design.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.780
We want very much to keep cultivating that.

10:31.780 --> 10:34.780
That's why also we try to have a blend of people showing off

10:34.780 --> 10:37.260
the tools they've made, but also people

10:37.260 --> 10:39.140
having a different kind of talk.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.660
I don't know what the right balance is,

10:40.660 --> 10:54.820
but we want to preserve this voice.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.820
It's one question.

11:00.820 --> 11:04.460
During my research, at some point during my PhD,

11:04.460 --> 11:07.620
I was part of a training workshop

11:07.620 --> 11:13.900
led by PhD students in product training of cells

11:13.900 --> 11:15.860
with best practices in mind and also

11:15.860 --> 11:19.020
to have a grassroots initiative, which

11:19.020 --> 11:22.220
I think is a good example of what

11:22.220 --> 11:24.180
works in a particular field.

11:24.180 --> 11:31.020
Is this kind of stories of what works in a particular domain

11:31.020 --> 11:35.540
would that be a thing interesting for this level?

11:35.540 --> 11:38.060
So are stories that work in a particular domain

11:38.060 --> 11:40.020
interesting for the dev room?

11:40.020 --> 11:43.380
Well, for me, I think it totally is.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.860
So the answer is yes.

11:44.860 --> 11:46.420
And I think we've somehow done that.

11:46.420 --> 11:49.780
But sometimes what it looks, once it's in the slides

11:49.780 --> 11:50.980
and here, it looks different.

11:50.980 --> 11:54.140
But that is very much the case.

11:54.140 --> 11:58.180
I think we do not have a clear typology of the kind of talks

11:58.180 --> 12:00.140
we accept.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.380
One very clear kind is the tool talk.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.660
I've done something, I show you that to you.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.740
Another kind would be experiment feedback.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.260
So I'm not going to show my tool.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.900
But for instance, I have engaged with that open source stack.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.180
And I've met issues.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.940
I'm going to talk about that.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.820
This is a little bit of that kind somehow.

12:22.700 --> 12:27.300
Do you think it would be good to add the small track dedicated

12:27.300 --> 12:29.660
to very short talks like lightning talks,

12:29.660 --> 12:34.020
but dedicated to?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.620
Repeat the question.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.460
So a question like, would it be a good idea

12:39.460 --> 12:42.540
to organize lightning, very short lightning talks

12:42.540 --> 12:44.580
about open research?

12:44.580 --> 12:46.780
So actually, we try to do that a little bit.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.260
Like, the three last talks were lightning.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.300
OK, lightning's 15 minutes.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.740
But I think it's, yeah.

12:54.740 --> 12:55.460
So we try.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.300
Actually, so the format lightning or not

12:57.300 --> 12:59.180
depends on the time we have.

12:59.180 --> 13:02.020
And what the speaker wants.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.220
So it basically is a tool.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.740
If you don't know how it works, people

13:05.740 --> 13:09.580
propose if they want a lightning talk or a normal talk.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.620
And then so we can also ask them to expand or reduce

13:13.620 --> 13:15.460
if we think it fits better.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.460
So we try to negotiate.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.060
But it's kind of unpredictable how many lightning talks

13:19.060 --> 13:20.340
we're going to have.

13:20.340 --> 13:25.300
So the proposals decide if there is enough for a tracker or not.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.900
From the two last questions, there

13:26.900 --> 13:29.900
is one thing that's very important that's emerging.

13:29.900 --> 13:34.860
So the form of things should be in question.

13:34.860 --> 13:39.660
And there is a sort of standardization associated

13:39.660 --> 13:41.580
with a conference.

13:41.580 --> 13:47.220
And as we receive talk, we perceive diversity,

13:47.220 --> 13:52.900
even in the form and or experiences, tools, or maybe

13:52.900 --> 13:53.400
talk.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.180
We do have a classifications.

13:55.180 --> 13:59.700
But seeing things here, it's sort of standardized.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.300
And maybe we should work together,

14:02.300 --> 14:05.220
so you're in this with us, on the form of things,

14:05.220 --> 14:08.540
on maybe other forms of presentations.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.700
We're not that constrained by the first them.

14:10.700 --> 14:17.860
So that's one way we could work forward into.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.300
But there are many things we could do.

14:20.300 --> 14:25.300
And I am Todd.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.780
I do have very much.

14:27.780 --> 14:32.260
I am part of your special community.

14:32.260 --> 14:37.260
And on the two side of the conference,

14:37.260 --> 14:40.260
we have the same programs.

14:40.260 --> 14:45.260
We have lots of developers who want to speak of their own.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.260
And the new teams and the new stuff,

14:47.260 --> 14:53.260
they have to do the program to have users who are speaking

14:53.260 --> 15:00.740
of how they use the tools and use KADs around.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.740
And it's very difficult. And it's pretty hard

15:03.740 --> 15:07.220
to keep the academic.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.700
We do have a colleague.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.180
I asked her for a film.

15:10.180 --> 15:11.660
And she put out her book.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.660
And she put it here.

15:14.660 --> 15:18.060
I asked her for the movie.

15:18.060 --> 15:22.060
And I came here on the area.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.060
She said, I don't speak.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.460
I'm not a developer.

15:25.460 --> 15:30.460
It's not the kind of meeting for me.

15:30.460 --> 15:34.460
So maybe we can speak a little bit.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.460
And she said, it's very open to everyone, not just the number.

15:37.460 --> 15:43.460
And I don't have the answer.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.500
the question in the comment was that in the,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.140
Nicolas says that in the Joe special,

15:48.140 --> 15:49.180
the dev room or community,

15:49.180 --> 15:51.060
they also have this issue of having users come

15:51.060 --> 15:52.340
because they don't feel welcome

15:52.340 --> 15:54.140
or they don't feel like they fit.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.700
So I want to give the mic to Maya

15:55.700 --> 15:57.680
because Maya was first,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.120
before she got in the committee for the room,

15:59.120 --> 16:02.260
she was presenting a talk here two years ago, I think.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.100
2020.

16:04.540 --> 16:08.020
As a user, so now you are in.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.920
So what would you give as an advice to those guys?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.680
Don't be scared, they're really nice.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.080
I understand your colleague perfectly,

16:19.080 --> 16:20.520
especially coming from academia,

16:20.520 --> 16:23.400
which is also my case.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.040
Academia is extremely segmented

16:26.040 --> 16:31.040
and we're taught to fear each other deeply.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.320
And so it can be really scary

16:34.320 --> 16:36.560
to push those boundaries a little bit.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.880
It can also be very rewarding.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.240
So you said she did come in 2020 or she didn't come?

16:44.240 --> 16:45.080
Okay.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.640
I tried two concurrency for them

16:47.640 --> 16:52.880
and the one I organized and the...

16:52.880 --> 16:57.520
Okay, so despite trying, there was no success yet.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.980
Maybe if you show them this replay,

17:02.440 --> 17:03.680
it will change everything.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.080
I got a question for you,

17:08.080 --> 17:12.560
which is, so one of our ideas or objective organizations

17:12.560 --> 17:15.900
was also to bring folks from academia here at the first time

17:15.900 --> 17:17.120
so that they can actually benefit

17:17.120 --> 17:19.500
from the other conference in all the dev rooms.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.880
So here's my questions like,

17:22.060 --> 17:24.320
do you consider seeing talks in other dev rooms

17:24.320 --> 17:26.920
and this one here, yourselves?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.560
Can you raise your hand if you do?

17:30.360 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, it's good.

17:32.000 --> 17:32.840
Yes.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.000
I'd like to.

17:34.000 --> 17:34.840
Yeah.

17:34.840 --> 17:39.840
So much, I think there is a lot of talk

17:39.840 --> 17:41.120
in the dev room.

17:41.120 --> 17:41.960
Yeah, yeah.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.960
It's difficult to see all the talks that we want to see,

17:45.960 --> 17:47.600
even though the offer is large.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.880
But, and conversely, who is here now,

17:51.880 --> 17:55.720
but who didn't come to the FOSDEM specifically for that?

17:55.720 --> 17:57.360
Okay, raise your hands.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.160
So it works also the other way around.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.000
Okay.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.560
Yeah, it's good.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.400
Thank you.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.240
Amazing.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.080
Okay.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.200
Is it time?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.040
No, not yet.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.560
So we still have 10 minutes.

18:10.440 --> 18:13.520
Then we'll actually watch the stream here,

18:13.520 --> 18:14.460
if you want to stay.

18:15.960 --> 18:16.800
Just a quick question.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.440
What is the acceptance rate here?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.640
That's a very good question.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.960
So the question is, what is the acceptance rate?

18:23.960 --> 18:24.980
I don't know.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.280
We haven't calculated it, but I think.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.000
It's not a rate, but it hasn't happened.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.040
I guess we...

18:32.040 --> 18:34.600
I would say that there is a part of the papers

18:34.600 --> 18:37.640
that are not good.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.400
I mean, they're out of focus for the dev room.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.720
And what we can do, actually,

18:42.720 --> 18:44.480
we can reroute a paper to other dev rooms.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.360
So it doesn't matter much.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.200
But also some people just submit to multiple dev rooms

18:48.200 --> 18:49.760
for the same speech, right?

18:49.760 --> 18:51.840
So, and it's okay, right?

18:51.840 --> 18:53.840
The boundaries are not super open.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.720
There are kind of buggy proposals.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.560
What we would consider not acceptable would be,

18:58.560 --> 19:01.080
is that something that is clearly for someone else,

19:01.080 --> 19:02.480
and we don't know why it's been submitted here,

19:02.480 --> 19:04.160
or something that has just a title.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.640
When that happened, we would kind of send an email.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.120
Sometimes we don't even have an answer.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.840
We don't know what happens.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.000
So if you remove those,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.120
the ones that we actually refuse,

19:14.120 --> 19:18.080
I think is like one third, one quarter, maybe,

19:18.080 --> 19:19.480
with not too much.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.040
So we are always, it's been always working for us.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.120
We need to have enough to fill the day,

19:24.120 --> 19:25.520
if we want to have a full day.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.820
But not too much that we have to refuse a lot of good talks.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.680
But to be honest, we've been refusing good talks every year.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.680
Just because there's not enough room.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.680
So basically, we decide about the balance

19:40.680 --> 19:41.640
when it's the case.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.520
So we have like too many or not enough tool talks.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.200
We will try to adjust this way.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.560
I can remember that one kind of a talk

19:50.560 --> 19:54.280
that we tend to reject are talks about tools

19:54.280 --> 19:57.300
that have been developed somewhere in research,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.400
but which is very specific.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.480
In a very specific domain, without any abstract,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.920
without any issues about what does open source side

20:05.920 --> 20:09.600
of the thing actually change anything in the story.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.280
So I mean, just a paper about the tool,

20:12.280 --> 20:14.040
which is in research,

20:14.040 --> 20:15.760
depends out of the quality of the abstract,

20:15.760 --> 20:18.420
but yeah, it's not enough in a way.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.520
Submitting is very, the abstract to submit is like,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.840
so a few paragraphs long, so it's really easy to submit.

20:25.840 --> 20:30.840
It's very easy to submit, please do. Yes?

20:30.840 --> 20:34.840
I did write about the young receptionist organization.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.920
So I was the first member of the Italian

20:37.920 --> 20:39.920
and PhD student association.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.760
Okay.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.200
You mentioned they, maybe.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.640
Good idea.

20:43.640 --> 20:48.000
So the question is like, have we tried PhD associations,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.840
a session of PhD students to email them,

20:50.840 --> 20:52.600
to propose them to submit a talk?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.560
No, we haven't.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.560
No, we haven't.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.360
And we are not very good at communication.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.720
Well, I'm bad, but they are good.

20:59.720 --> 21:00.560
Yep.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.200
Yeah, I should say as an academic,

21:02.200 --> 21:05.000
I feel, well, as an academic and a developer,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.640
I feel like there is a tendency for academic labs

21:08.640 --> 21:12.120
to have sort of a rotation of conferences that they present at.

21:12.120 --> 21:16.560
And it typically is difficult to get added to that

21:16.560 --> 21:18.800
as a new conference,

21:18.800 --> 21:21.200
and especially if it's something that's sort of

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
outside of the norm.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.640
And so it's something that I do think,

21:26.240 --> 21:28.320
I think most of the time that's not sort of intentional.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.160
It's just there's so much else going on,

21:30.160 --> 21:31.960
people don't really think about it.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.360
So I would second the suggestion of talking

21:34.360 --> 21:35.800
to PhD student associations

21:35.800 --> 21:39.040
if you're reaching out to universities,

21:39.040 --> 21:43.440
especially universities that might have also to say,

21:43.440 --> 21:46.760
hey, this is an opportunity for interdisciplinary work.

21:46.760 --> 21:51.760
I'm going to do to talk to people who are more technical,

21:51.760 --> 21:53.600
if you're less technical,

21:53.600 --> 21:56.960
or people who are more in open disciplines,

21:56.960 --> 22:01.960
because that sort of stuff is in vogue right now as well.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.560
Interdisciplinary is very important right now.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.120
Collaboration is very important right now.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.520
So I think that once you're on the radar,

22:10.520 --> 22:11.960
it's going to be easier to get people,

22:11.960 --> 22:13.960
it's just getting on the radar.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.400
So the comment was that actually,

22:16.400 --> 22:19.000
it's not easy for labs members

22:19.000 --> 22:22.160
to actually add one more communication conference

22:22.160 --> 22:25.360
in the list of an already existing kind of standard

22:26.280 --> 22:27.440
publication venue.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.160
And above all, when this venue like here

22:32.160 --> 22:34.680
is really not standard, I can't really speaking.

22:36.440 --> 22:41.440
But actually, the interdisciplinary of this room

22:42.200 --> 22:47.280
will be actually a good way to attract notably PhD students

22:47.280 --> 22:50.520
and to make it clear for academia

22:50.520 --> 22:51.920
what the space is basically.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.640
I'm really curious about in the room

22:58.640 --> 23:00.680
and whether anybody else in the room,

23:00.680 --> 23:02.600
other than myself and the people that I know,

23:02.600 --> 23:06.640
would identify as like UX designers,

23:06.640 --> 23:09.360
not developers or academics.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.680
Okay, so that's a very good question.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.960
The question is like, who would in this room

23:14.960 --> 23:19.680
define him or herself as a UX designer?

23:19.680 --> 23:20.880
Can you raise your hand?

23:22.880 --> 23:23.840
There's one there.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.320
So not many, not many.

23:31.480 --> 23:36.480
Are you trying to get the open design room?

23:36.480 --> 23:37.320
The room?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.840
We're doing research into how usable research

23:41.840 --> 23:45.160
and design is to pick some sort of software

23:45.160 --> 23:48.360
so we're trying to figure out like usability

23:48.360 --> 23:51.400
and design and design to figure out.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.240
Okay, cool.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.880
Here, we're just going to open it

23:54.880 --> 23:59.880
and using our designer brains to use events.

23:59.880 --> 24:03.240
Okay, so the comment was, are you aware

24:03.240 --> 24:05.360
that actually there is an open design dev room?

24:05.360 --> 24:08.160
And so then says, yes, actually you co-organize it.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.640
And actually this room is here tomorrow morning,

24:11.640 --> 24:14.360
I think, afternoon, sorry.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.320
And my personal comment on this is that

24:19.320 --> 24:21.480
actually in my career and what I've done,

24:21.480 --> 24:25.080
my experience, UX is very common stone

24:25.080 --> 24:30.080
to go beyond the big, big issue of mixing

24:32.000 --> 24:35.440
qualitative and quantitative approach on data

24:35.440 --> 24:38.720
as my talk tried a little bit to explain.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.440
And that yes, we need designers

24:40.440 --> 24:44.520
and we have one here who talked about it

24:44.520 --> 24:47.680
and in our previous lab, that was very important

24:47.680 --> 24:49.440
so good to discover the mini-rat

24:49.440 --> 24:51.760
is a very place where they try to do this mix.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.680
Fair enough.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.960
I think that, no, it's even less than.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.960
Maybe you want to elaborate.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.200
We should try to not overlap.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.080
It's good this year, the years before

25:06.080 --> 25:09.280
and it's annoying, I think we have kind of

25:09.280 --> 25:11.280
the same public or partially.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.200
So if we could, I don't know if we can do that,

25:13.200 --> 25:15.000
we should ask at least there or whatever.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.480
It's better if we can maintain it separate.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.840
Oh yeah, not at the same time.

25:18.840 --> 25:19.680
We can do that.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.160
Actually we could also talk about what we do.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.080
Right, one last comment is Mike,

25:28.080 --> 25:30.880
if you want after the online session,

25:30.880 --> 25:34.600
we can have drinks together in a place which is.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.440
Tavarnier.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.840
Tavarnier, Tavarnier.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.800
It's close to here.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.720
We are going to write that on the board, Tavarnier.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.120
It's close to here.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.800
And I'm going to set up the stream here

25:46.800 --> 25:50.760
so you can stay here and watch it with us if you want.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.920
So it will be only, we are going to stream the video

25:53.920 --> 25:55.120
and the interaction.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.480
If you want to ask questions to the speakers,

25:57.480 --> 25:59.280
you have to go through the chat room

25:59.280 --> 26:00.960
on the first day website, right?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.640
Thank you all.

26:03.640 --> 26:10.160
Applause
