WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.880
Wednesday, when we did the unboxing event, that since we do hope that everyone will be

00:16.880 --> 00:21.600
welcome to a PEM port project, we needed to make sure that the invite system could cope

00:21.600 --> 00:28.280
with all the different use cases that you get with our link expiration, who got the

00:28.280 --> 00:31.480
invite, do any to re-send it, etc.

00:31.480 --> 00:37.720
Otherwise the onboarding experience would be tough and people would not be joining the

00:37.720 --> 00:39.400
design project.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.200
And this is very important for us because this is not only a tool for designers to just

00:44.200 --> 00:48.440
express their creativity but also for developers to join the design process, to be welcome

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
there.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.880
So this is very important for us.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.480
But of course we had many improvements in the interactive prototype feature.

00:59.480 --> 01:03.660
This is just one example for the overlay advancement.

01:03.660 --> 01:13.940
So here you can see how a design asset is being self-referred and you get a very nice

01:13.940 --> 01:21.360
pixel perfect overlay on a button and then an animation that comes with a mouse click.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.400
Do you like this?

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
I think you do.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Yeah, I think you do.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.400
This is happening.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.400
This is happening.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.400
This is awesome.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.480
This is amazing.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.520
So this is just about a token.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.320
I do mean, I mean, do go and enjoy PEM port.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.080
But it has many features on advanced prototyping.

01:41.080 --> 01:47.120
But this is one thing that actually came from this official release.

01:47.120 --> 01:50.680
As it did nested boards.

01:50.680 --> 01:58.520
So here you can see in this animation, like an independent board being dragged to another

01:58.520 --> 02:01.720
board and having this nesting effect.

02:01.720 --> 02:07.480
This actually was a bit tricky because as you know PEM port uses SVG natively.

02:07.480 --> 02:12.740
So when I say open standards, we do really mean open standards.

02:12.740 --> 02:17.320
And it was tough to have this root element having everything.

02:17.320 --> 02:23.000
So to have different independent components being designed, we had to do this nested board

02:23.000 --> 02:25.040
trick.

02:25.040 --> 02:31.040
But that trick actually gave us a lot of potential because when you have nested boards, you can

02:31.040 --> 02:34.920
do much more advanced compositing in general.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.760
And so we have like the best of all worlds.

02:36.760 --> 02:43.320
We have SVG, but also these neat tricks for compositing.

02:43.320 --> 02:53.920
Also, let me remind you for those of you that don't know much about PEM port that we have

02:53.920 --> 02:57.520
like some innovations in terms of where to find stuff.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.120
When you do engineering, you think about scale.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
Like I need to scale up.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.120
I need to automate.

03:03.120 --> 03:10.080
I need to have everything like in tiny bits so I can combine them any way I want.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.080
With design, with big design architectures, you have that same challenge.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.520
Otherwise, it gets just manual.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.120
Like design is just manual.

03:18.120 --> 03:22.360
And it can only go as far as your brain can cope with stuff.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.080
So having like your components, your libraries and assets readily available here, whether

03:28.080 --> 03:34.320
there are fonts or colors or design tokens or whatever, it's really cool.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.400
Also a whole lot of libraries, and you drag and drop or you create new ones and they are

03:40.400 --> 03:44.680
there on your left pane.

03:44.680 --> 03:51.240
So this actually comes from the PEM port design system, which is the first one example that

03:51.240 --> 03:52.960
you can one-click import.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.840
If you go to PEM port, you do the onboarding.

03:55.840 --> 03:56.840
It's very nice.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.360
By the way, it's a nice bottle challenge that you can try and do.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.600
Anyone here did the bottle challenge?

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
Okay.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.600
Some of you do.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.360
It's a nice little game where you learn by fun.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.720
It's like you learn the PEM port basics using this bottle challenge.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.920
But when you actually go into more advanced topics, this is what you really need.

04:18.920 --> 04:28.680
So go and check the PEM port design system because it's kind of neatly organized.

04:28.680 --> 04:36.520
And then we get something so cool that no one had, which is FlexLayout.

04:36.520 --> 04:42.960
So every design and prototyping system out there would have this killer feature where

04:42.960 --> 04:46.640
you can smartly apply rules to your design.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.520
Say I want my design to flow this way.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.840
And then you would change the content within that design and those rules would apply automatically.

04:54.840 --> 05:00.780
So for designers, I'm seeing people are saying, yes, yes, I know why we're talking here.

05:00.780 --> 05:06.200
Some designers would feel a massive productivity boost thanks to that.

05:06.200 --> 05:11.240
You can call it auto layout, smart layout, fancy layout, whatever.

05:11.240 --> 05:18.320
They could not have this once they were exposed to that.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.320
It's like not having this once you know about this intelligent layout system is like going

05:24.320 --> 05:28.960
really back in time and having to do everything manually.

05:28.960 --> 05:39.120
So the problem with this, as we thought at PEM port, was that unfortunately, these layout

05:39.120 --> 05:49.240
systems were design-centric, which is not bad per se, but was not developer-friendly.

05:49.240 --> 05:55.840
Basically it was not team-friendly, meaning designers would do their smart layout system

05:55.840 --> 06:00.500
and then all the vocabulary and the ideas, the abstractions were just for designers to

06:00.500 --> 06:02.320
understand and to enjoy.

06:02.320 --> 06:11.640
And then developers would go there and say, I need to translate this into code.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.040
Let's hope there's no issues, but there were issues.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.560
Not only technical issues, but also friction issues like back and forth.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.480
This, am I in control?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.960
No, I'm not.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.840
Neither the designer nor the developer.

06:26.840 --> 06:31.560
They would feel like they would have to constantly double check, double check.

06:31.560 --> 06:37.320
And you don't scale up your design or your code if you have to do that.

06:37.320 --> 06:43.320
PEM port came with a completely different approach and said, what if we have code-first

06:43.320 --> 06:45.180
design layout?

06:45.180 --> 06:49.160
What if already the design is the code?

06:49.160 --> 06:51.800
You can do a ton of stuff with Flex, CSS.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.500
It's actually quite advanced.

06:54.500 --> 07:01.920
So what if we say, let's do a developer-first design layout system?

07:01.920 --> 07:07.920
And we came up with Flex layout, and please do applaud here, because it's the first ever

07:07.920 --> 07:12.800
tool to have this, and it's open source.

07:12.800 --> 07:24.200
And the great thing about this is that this is not a gift from engineers to designers

07:24.200 --> 07:26.760
saying, I made this for you.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Please use it.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.880
I hope you're excited about this.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.600
But actually, designers wanted this.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.440
So no compromises here.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.040
Everyone wins.

07:37.040 --> 07:42.160
We got 50 to 60 volunteers for the beta testing of this.

07:42.160 --> 07:47.440
And I'm not saying you could not test it using our development branch, but a proper environment

07:47.440 --> 07:54.840
setup for people to go and do some simple tests like this one and give us feedback.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.560
And the feedback was phenomenal.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.960
I think 80% came from designers and 20% from engineers.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.080
So that was nice.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.840
That was nice.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.520
Given the fact that in the world, so that you know it, statistically, there's one designer

08:10.520 --> 08:13.720
pretend developers, roughly.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.600
We don't think that's a good ratio.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.720
At college, we have one to two, so pretty different.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.160
Somewhere in between, perhaps, one to four would be great.

08:23.160 --> 08:27.120
But of course, to beta test this, we couldn't have the one to ten ratio in our pod.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.040
We needed to reverse that.

08:29.040 --> 08:35.160
But we didn't have to work hard to achieve that, because designers were actually asking

08:35.160 --> 08:37.980
to beta test this in the first place.

08:37.980 --> 08:44.160
So if you're familiar with Flex CSS, you can see properties there.

08:44.160 --> 08:53.440
And then, of course, you get, here I'm simulating two, this is a real time collaboration, because

08:53.440 --> 08:55.800
we do have real time collaboration, of course.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.440
And this is like two browsers.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.800
It doesn't look like that, because I made it pixel perfect in a way.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.640
But that code pane there, the code inspector, is actually a second browser just beneath.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.640
Right?

09:07.640 --> 09:08.640
It's just in fancy.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.480
But you can see how real time that is changing.

09:11.480 --> 09:16.320
So a designer is changing the design using Flex layout.

09:16.320 --> 09:21.240
And as the designer does that, the developer can see that code being changed.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.520
Just is a different tab selection there.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.360
That's all it takes.

09:26.360 --> 09:32.360
So I'm not saying that a developer should be quickly copy and pasting when it changes.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.280
But it's nice for the demo.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.480
You see that it's real.

09:36.480 --> 09:42.440
There's no like export concept of anything.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.480
And really, that's it.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.480
Thank you.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.800
It happened.

09:49.800 --> 10:01.920
I do hope we have some time for questions, because I planned for that.

10:01.920 --> 10:02.920
That is great.

10:02.920 --> 10:06.720
That's a real point.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.520
I'd rather not pick if you could store that.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.880
You had done it really, really quickly.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.880
So that's going to be impressive.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.880
Thank you for the talk.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.560
My company is providing a design system.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.880
And they provide it for Sigma, or Figma.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.240
Toit?

10:21.240 --> 10:32.240
Or do we have something that exists to guide me?

10:22.880 --> 10:32.240
And is there any kind of process I can follow to use the assets in Pen

10:32.240 --> 10:36.640
So the question was about perhaps migrating the design system from.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.360
We already have a company design system.

10:39.360 --> 10:44.400
So I have to respect this library with the assets and the design itself.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.440
I just want to use it in Pen Toit.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.920
So if you are using a design system on Figma right now, and you want also to use Pen Toit,

10:54.920 --> 10:56.880
there's a ton of overlap.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.760
So it might feel weird for you to use the two if you're not migrating.

11:01.760 --> 11:07.360
The answer is I'm not sure it makes sense, because this is about team dynamics.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.760
This is about people collaborating.

11:09.760 --> 11:15.920
So unless you want to export these Figma assets and use it privately for you, with

11:15.920 --> 11:20.320
no going back, if that is, I mean, you're smiling, so I guess that's what I want.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.480
I want to live in my private open source world.

11:22.480 --> 11:27.280
I'm not going to pay for licenses for the whole team.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.720
But that seems to me, I get that you can save some money doing that.

11:32.720 --> 11:36.240
But honestly, it's going to not save you much time.

11:36.240 --> 11:41.720
So you have to keep a balance there, because it's going to be back and forth, not within

11:41.720 --> 11:46.880
Pen Pot, but within two tools that compete in the space of the use case.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.220
But I mean, go ahead and tell me how it looks.

11:51.220 --> 11:55.760
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I think it's going to have a bit of overhead for you.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.400
If you're willing to take that, you have a sticker.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.800
I'll give you a sticker, like the shiny one.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.040
By the way, who was, may I ask a question?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.560
Who was here three years ago?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.080
Can you raise your hand?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.200
Oh, OK, yeah.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.480
OK, we have stickers, like super premium stickers for you.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.480
Next question.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
Yeah.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.480
So good relations with the release.

12:17.480 --> 12:25.240
My question is, you showed us there was a live update of the output code when you were

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
using the designer.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
Yes.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.240
Is there a reverse also possible?

12:28.240 --> 12:35.240
Can I as a developer give a piece of code to the designer and can he copy paste it into

12:35.240 --> 12:36.240
some way?

12:36.240 --> 12:43.600
So the question is, we saw the real time transformation between the design and the code.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
Is it full duplex?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.840
Can I change the code?

12:46.840 --> 12:47.840
Not for now.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
Not for now.

12:48.840 --> 12:49.840
Not for now.

12:49.840 --> 12:55.080
But of course, it feels like you would like to do the other way around.

12:55.080 --> 13:02.760
I'll actually go on with that question theme and say, what if you connect that with a gear

13:02.760 --> 13:06.000
repository?

13:06.000 --> 13:13.800
And you change that in the gear repository that comes back and changes the design.

13:13.800 --> 13:18.480
What if as a designer you change something that also goes to the gear repository and triggers

13:18.480 --> 13:20.680
a CICD process?

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
OK.

13:21.680 --> 13:28.840
So we thought about that because it's kind of what comes next, obviously.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.280
But yeah, so good question.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.280
We've got to be covered.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
OK.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.280
So the...

13:35.280 --> 13:36.280
Yes, yes.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
The person...

13:37.280 --> 13:47.280
I should just run over and say this person.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.160
Congratulations.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.160
Thank you.

13:51.160 --> 14:13.080
So, resources for helping teams migrating from other tools to PEMPA?

14:13.080 --> 14:18.320
Yeah, yeah, I mean...

14:18.320 --> 14:20.680
Figma, what is that?

14:20.680 --> 14:24.120
Fagma owns 80% of the market for designers.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.120
80%.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.480
Adobe now owns 87% of the market.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.320
Thanks to that.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.640
So obviously, yeah, I get that.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.800
We have a plugin, an export plugin.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.600
We hope that the community can help us just improve it so that you can basically export

14:43.600 --> 14:44.840
all that from...

14:44.840 --> 14:51.280
We actually don't know how much time we've got for that plugin to be OK for Figma, but

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
it's still there.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.960
So that is one way you can quickly test that.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.520
It's not, by any means, complete.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.600
So it will give you the basics, but it might be enough.

15:01.600 --> 15:06.800
And then I think everything like exporting stuff and just re-importing that is really

15:06.800 --> 15:13.440
quick for teams to have the design system re-uploaded here somehow.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.080
I don't think it's going to take much time.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.360
If you have the motivation, it's just...

15:17.360 --> 15:21.080
I mean, depending on the complexity of the prototypes and design...

15:21.080 --> 15:23.600
This is for prototyping, and this is also for design.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.040
So depending on the complexity for each topic, it might get...

15:27.040 --> 15:32.480
But yeah, the export plugin, we really hope that we get more help from the community.

15:32.480 --> 15:43.400
So if anyone here is interested in those serialization challenges for the SVG and the JSON,

15:43.400 --> 15:47.280
because it's all it has, really, that would be great.

15:47.280 --> 15:53.080
From the abstraction model that we have from Figma to actually proper open standards, fine.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.080
So yeah, that's good.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.720
I actually realized that I figured it out myself.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
OK.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.720
So I'll answer your question.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.720
So there was somebody over here that had a...

16:05.720 --> 16:07.720
Congrats on the launch.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.720
Thank you.

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
It's really great to see.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.720
I'm curious about the business side of things.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.720
You mentioned Figma as a competitor.

16:13.720 --> 16:18.720
How do you plan to continue with Figma and be successful at it, and at the same time,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
drive your business forward?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
So Calleres is a company.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.720
Actually, there's a title called Calleres Open Source.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.720
That's the SL, because we're a Spanish company.

16:29.720 --> 16:34.720
So the idea for us is to make sure that we follow this...

16:34.720 --> 16:41.720
We think it's going to be kind of an enterprise edition that will give companies things that

16:41.720 --> 16:45.720
the power user does not want or doesn't need.

16:45.720 --> 16:50.720
We call that privately, publicly tax the controller.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.720
OK.

16:51.720 --> 16:56.720
So that is something that we don't really need right now, because, to be honest,

16:56.720 --> 17:00.720
there's still a ton of things that we have to do for the product.

17:00.720 --> 17:07.720
But basically, perhaps in two years, if we are relevant, we hope we are relevant.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.720
We'll see.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.720
See you in two years, post them.

17:12.720 --> 17:20.720
But if we are really relevant, then we will look for those tax the controller features

17:20.720 --> 17:23.720
that the companies are fine.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.720
They won't contribute with code.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.720
They won't contribute with content.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.720
They will contribute with money.

17:29.720 --> 17:32.720
So we don't have the details, but it's going to be like...

17:32.720 --> 17:35.720
And this has been publicly said many times.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.720
The power user gets open source forever.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.720
If the company is wanting to have this control mechanism,

17:42.720 --> 17:45.720
they will have to pay for something that is exclusive to them,

17:45.720 --> 17:47.720
whether it's self-host or SaaS.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
We don't care.

17:48.720 --> 17:52.720
Actually, by the way, there is also a desktop app by the community

17:52.720 --> 17:55.720
that encapsulated Penpot with Electron.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.720
So you can also have a pure desktop native experience.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.720
So yeah, it's there actually in the community space, community.penpot.app.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.720
We will elaborate a bit more on that.

18:06.720 --> 18:13.720
The only way this will be sustainable as a company is that we are really relevant.

18:13.720 --> 18:19.720
Surprisingly, the design space, in our view, is quite immature.

18:19.720 --> 18:23.720
You have one tool, winner takes all.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.720
Then the next tool, then the next, there are subsequent winners.

18:27.720 --> 18:34.720
We hope that we add fragmentation to that, but still be relevant.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.720
So we have like one minute left.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.720
Yeah, I answered your question.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
You answered the second part.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.720
I missed the first part of how you actually tend to compete with Figma.

18:43.720 --> 18:47.720
You tend to maybe drive business away from Figma toward Penpot.

18:47.720 --> 18:54.720
Well, I think the playbook that we have is quite unique and unprecedented.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.720
This is open source design and prototyping tool.

18:57.720 --> 19:04.720
So we hope that we have a bottom-up distribution model.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.720
People are really saying this is actually much better.

19:06.720 --> 19:12.720
And we are hoping, this is part of our, yeah, this is hope,

19:12.720 --> 19:15.720
that you remember that ratio, one designer, pretend developers,

19:15.720 --> 19:21.720
that developers actually loving open source do bring Penpot to the forefront.

19:21.720 --> 19:25.720
Without the help from open source developers, I'm sure this is not going to happen.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.720
Not because designers don't like open source,

19:28.720 --> 19:33.720
just because the economics of that will take much longer.

19:33.720 --> 19:39.720
So yeah, that one to 10 ratio is the only time I'm happy with that ratio,

19:39.720 --> 19:41.720
in this particular case it's like.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.720
So we are counting on open source developers really.

19:44.720 --> 19:45.720
Thank you.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.720
So, no worries on coming.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.720
Okay, if you want to have a chat afterwards,

19:49.720 --> 19:53.720
I'm sure Pablo is very, very happy to answer questions.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.720
So that's, we have five minutes for people to leave and people to come in.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.720
So I'm going to say thank you, Pablo.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
Thank you.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.720
Thank you.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.720
Thank you.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
Thank you.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.720
Thank you.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.720
Thank you.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.720
Thank you.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
Thank you.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
Thank you.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
Thank you.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.720
Thank you.

20:10.720 --> 20:16.720
Thank you.
