00:00.000 --> 00:29.880
So, good morning everyone.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.320
So my name is ArvÃ© and I'm French.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.960
Sorry, my English is not very perfect.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.960
It's not my mother tongue.

00:37.960 --> 00:43.320
But I work for an NGO called Open Factor, which is a French NGO.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.640
I'm going to talk about it right now.

00:46.640 --> 00:54.200
So self-funded NGO based in France and we created it in 2019.

00:54.200 --> 00:59.920
Our initial goal was to try to federate the francophone-osint open source intelligence

00:59.920 --> 01:07.240
scene as we noticed that the anglophone one was pretty active and brilliant with Bellincat,

01:07.240 --> 01:09.160
for example, people like that.

01:09.160 --> 01:16.720
So we decided to create this NGO and we wanted to assist the newsrooms and activists on ozint

01:16.720 --> 01:19.160
even investigation.

01:19.160 --> 01:25.040
We also wanted to train journalists about what we knew about and also wanted to promote

01:25.040 --> 01:33.600
young journalists based in France in order to help them to get some skills on ozint,

01:33.600 --> 01:40.360
which is a kind of pragmatical way to find a job in France right now.

01:40.360 --> 01:47.640
And as we are an NGO, a self-funded NGO, we also wanted to set up some philanthropic projects

01:47.640 --> 01:55.920
and we trained investigative journalists from Syria, which are relocated in Europe.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.640
We also did some programs in West Africa, all the francophone area.

02:00.640 --> 02:06.160
The NGO today is about 260 members and it's still counting.

02:06.160 --> 02:15.120
And about me, some of the work first, we participated to some of pretty cool investigations such

02:15.120 --> 02:17.920
as Green Blood for a media called Forbidden Stories.

02:17.920 --> 02:23.600
We also published some things and worked on things for BBC, for the French television,

02:23.600 --> 02:26.680
on the Wagner Group, for example.

02:26.680 --> 02:35.600
And we also won a prize with the Swiss TV for a documentary on war crimes in Ukraine.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.120
And recently we published two recommendable reports on Infoross.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.720
I don't know if you've ever heard about that.

02:42.720 --> 02:50.320
It's a Russian company backed by the Russian intelligence and we also work on that and

02:50.320 --> 02:55.600
try to dismantle their network of disinformation inside their border.

02:55.600 --> 03:02.040
And about me, I'm not a coder, obviously, as you probably see.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.560
I'm the co-founder of the NGO.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.960
I'm a former judicial investigator and I'm an open source software enthusiast.

03:09.960 --> 03:17.680
And I've been compiling, well, I used to compile Linux kernels since 1999 or something like

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
that.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.120
So I'm an open source software enthusiast and evangelist.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.760
And not a techie, I'm a techie, but not a coder.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.800
And I consider myself rather like a Swiss army knife.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.720
I'm very lazy and believe me, if you want to solve a problem, hire a lazy guy or lazy

03:33.720 --> 03:34.720
woman.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.720
And I'm very curious.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.200
What about this information?

03:39.200 --> 03:40.960
This topic is about disinformation.

03:40.960 --> 03:48.160
So disinformation is, as you probably know, false information that is deliberately spread

03:48.160 --> 03:51.960
by an actor in order to deceive people.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.520
There is a fantastic researcher called Ben Nemo.

03:55.520 --> 04:03.480
He tried to resume this concept using the 4D's acronym.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.520
The first one is dismiss.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.640
The other one is distract.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.440
Distort the truth and also dismay.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.720
So that's a very good way to define disinformation.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.160
It's an art for several actors, several threat actors.

04:21.160 --> 04:29.280
You can compare CTI, for example, CTI, sorry, and disinformation.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.440
There are some overlap between these actors.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.040
And there is a very great investigation.

04:34.040 --> 04:39.960
All the links are on the presentation, but there is a really cool investigation called

04:39.960 --> 04:43.560
Doppelganger by the EU Dizinfo Lab.

04:43.560 --> 04:53.040
And I strongly recommend this report about media clones serving the Russian propaganda.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.400
I'm going to switch from time to time in the presentation.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.400
This information is about war, but also health, politics, economy.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.440
It covers mostly every topic, actually.

05:05.440 --> 05:16.520
And of course, internet and the web are probably the greatest echo chamber that they use.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.760
In France, we have such a problem.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.920
And we have a problem with QAnon.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.720
And there is a website called Cactus in France.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.960
It's called Cactus.

05:26.960 --> 05:35.080
It's a judgment for QAQ2 for news and Cactus the tree.

05:35.080 --> 05:40.360
So QAnon is an American political conspiracy, sorry, and political movement.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.960
I'm pretty sure you heard about it.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.400
And it's mostly far right based.

05:45.400 --> 05:50.600
And it appeared on the net in 2017.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.840
This website, this French website is, of course, Conspiracist.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.920
It's all about anti-vaxx.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.120
And it's also very anti-Semitic.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.840
So it's a problem.

06:02.840 --> 06:09.000
It's present on several platforms, such as, of course, the web, but also Telegram, Twitter,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.640
Gabor, GAB, et cetera, all the network.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.840
It has some kind of translated content.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.680
So as soon as you arrive on a web page, it depends on the language, but you can get the

06:19.680 --> 06:23.160
news automatically in French or in English.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.720
This is via Tor, the Tor browser.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.800
So it's basically in English.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.680
But you can also save it in French, for example.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.120
And most of the readers are French or Francophone.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.840
It publishes five or seven articles a day, mostly crap.

06:37.840 --> 06:42.440
It's always crap.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.280
It has more than two million visitors per month.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.440
So it's not nothing.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.120
It's a lot of people.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.720
I have a personal blog and I have an open factor blog.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.600
And we don't have two million visitors a month.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.720
I can assure you.

06:56.720 --> 07:01.640
And since it was open, it revendicates more than 80 million visitors.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.160
So yeah, it's kind of big things.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.600
It's one of the most productive Q&A websites.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.800
So in order to make the investigation, we needed a methodology on disinformation.

07:11.800 --> 07:17.320
And there is a very good framework called the ABCDE, very easy to remember.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
It's a good start.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.440
So A stands for actor.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.560
So who is doing the disinformation campaign?

07:23.560 --> 07:28.200
The behavior, how, the content, what about the content, of course.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.640
The degree, it means the scale of the disinformation campaign.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.920
And the last one, he, the he was added later.

07:34.920 --> 07:43.320
But he means the effect that is looking by the actor.

07:43.320 --> 07:50.120
So if we based our research at open factor for cactus, we would say something like, what

07:50.120 --> 07:51.800
is cactus?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.440
What's its audience?

07:53.440 --> 07:58.560
Its environment, ecosystem, its influence, its motivation above all.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.080
And last but not least, if we can identify who is behind cactus, it's really cool for

08:04.080 --> 08:06.560
us as journalists.

08:06.560 --> 08:12.720
So we decided to approach this by trying to qualify the environment.

08:12.720 --> 08:20.080
And in order to do that, we used three different tools that I mentioned as a sweet combo.

08:20.080 --> 08:25.720
The first one is HIVE, and it's a tool that was made, most of these tools were made by

08:25.720 --> 08:28.640
the Media Lab Sciences Po.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.400
And HIVE is one of the greatest one.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.040
It's a tool that you can download on your computer.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.120
And it mostly scrapes the web starting from a URL.

08:40.120 --> 08:45.320
And you can build a web corpus of all the websites that are connected to this website

08:45.320 --> 08:47.240
by the links inside the article.

08:47.240 --> 08:56.400
So it was very cool to use with cactus because the most important activity of cactus is

08:56.400 --> 09:01.200
writing articles, as I mentioned, but inside they put links to other articles, sometimes

09:01.200 --> 09:06.760
legit, sometimes links that leads you to other conspiracist websites.

09:06.760 --> 09:13.400
So kind of a long process because right now at the moment of the investigation, cactus

09:13.400 --> 09:18.720
had about 8,000 something articles on the website.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.600
So it took me a long time to scrape everything.

09:21.600 --> 09:28.160
And I had to go to the level two in order to scrape the link from the website that were

09:28.160 --> 09:32.160
cited by Kirk too, if I'm clear about it.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.920
So I had to go at a level of two.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.120
It works pretty well with a caveat.

09:38.120 --> 09:44.680
There are some limitations with Hive, especially one that really bothers us.

09:44.680 --> 09:50.240
It's Cloudflare, sorry for the typo, because as soon as you arrive on a Cloudflare website

09:50.240 --> 09:55.280
and a lot of websites are protected by Cloudflare, you cannot scrape it.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.080
You cannot scrape them with Hive.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.400
But it works pretty well.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.840
Actually, not on my computer.

10:01.840 --> 10:07.640
I tried at the hotel yesterday night and it doesn't work, but believe me, it works.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.760
So I scraped the links.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.320
I'm going to show you the result after that.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.040
The first tool that I combined with Hive was, of course, Jefy.

10:15.040 --> 10:20.440
I've been an enthusiast of Jefy since probably 2011 or something like that.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.800
And it's a very interesting tool to explore and analyze graphs.

10:24.800 --> 10:30.720
And especially if you try to use the modularity algorithm to determine sub-communities.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.840
And it's a brilliant tool that I'm sure you already know about.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.460
And the last one was important for us as journalists.

10:37.460 --> 10:44.320
We tried to illustrate our articles with images and graphs, et cetera.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.660
And it's very difficult to render graphs on websites.

10:46.660 --> 10:52.320
So this tool is brand new and one of its authors is in this room, actually, and I'm super happy

10:52.320 --> 10:54.680
to know that.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.240
And it's Retina.

10:56.240 --> 11:06.240
And Retina offers you the opportunity to import a graph inside your website and to dive into

11:06.240 --> 11:10.960
it and to analyze it or at least to help the people try to understand it.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.180
And that's really cool.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.880
So that's what we got.

11:13.880 --> 11:18.600
And I'm going to show you the rendering of the article.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.920
So this is Hive.

11:20.920 --> 11:25.680
And based on the three tools, what I tried to do is to illustrate the environment of

11:25.680 --> 11:26.680
the website.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.080
So the first one at the top level is Cactus.

11:29.080 --> 11:34.120
And all these websites were at least once mentioned in the articles.

11:34.120 --> 11:41.760
And then all the websites also cite the other one.

11:41.760 --> 11:48.160
And here, for example, you can reach the American disinformation network.

11:48.160 --> 11:53.300
You've got the Francophone one here and the Canadian one here.

11:53.300 --> 11:58.240
So it's very interesting to see where Cactus is in the middle of everything.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.560
So I try to illustrate the graph like this.

12:01.560 --> 12:08.800
So it gives you with this three tools a very good idea of the environment of the website.

12:08.800 --> 12:14.960
What you can see inside also are some legitimate websites such as MediaPart, for example, or

12:14.960 --> 12:16.360
YouTube, et cetera, et cetera.

12:16.360 --> 12:22.560
And that's one of their techniques in order to drain some, to lead some activity on the

12:22.560 --> 12:28.880
website, they link regular website and also conspiracies website.

12:28.880 --> 12:34.840
It's in order to increase their SEO, their ranking on Google, for example.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.560
So it's very important to put legitimate and disinformation website.

12:39.560 --> 12:46.600
So that was the first part of the investigation purely made with open source software.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.360
The second one was the influence.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.000
And it's rather usual to do that.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.240
So we needed a good scraper for Twitter.

12:54.240 --> 13:02.760
Our idea was to have an idea on how the disinformation could escape from their traditional networks

13:02.760 --> 13:10.240
such as Gabe or Paner, for example, and to escape from this platform to go to mainstream

13:10.240 --> 13:11.240
platforms.

13:11.240 --> 13:17.000
So Twitter is a really good, used to be a very good platform to analyze.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.520
I don't know what's going on.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.160
I don't know what it's going to be within a few days, but essence scrape is a cool tool

13:23.160 --> 13:24.160
to do that.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.400
I don't know if you heard about it.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.020
It's a scraper for Twitter.

13:29.020 --> 13:36.080
So what we did basically was to extract all the tweets from its creation that had a link

13:36.080 --> 13:40.040
referring to cactus.fr, which was the website.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.680
And we wanted to know about its activity.

13:42.680 --> 13:47.880
So you just basically open a terminal and you copy paste this.

13:47.880 --> 13:54.200
I'm not going to export to it first, but what you receive, I hope my connection is okay.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.200
Yes.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.840
So you get all the tweets.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.160
You can grab a cafe.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.440
You don't have to scroll.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.780
And when you come back, you get all the tweets.

14:03.780 --> 14:08.560
So there are approximately 124,000 tweets that talk about it.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.500
Once again, it's not nothing.

14:10.500 --> 14:15.320
And you can export that as a JSON file.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.040
Here.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
So it's going to work.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.360
I'm going to break it right now.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.840
Once you have these tweets, you have to scrape them and you have to wrangle your data.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.640
And I used another tool called OpenRefine.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.800
You probably know about OpenRefine.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.620
It's a powerful tool to cleanse.

14:37.620 --> 14:45.320
And there is a wow effect for journalists, especially with this tool that I like.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.960
It's how it deals with JSON file.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.360
So this is going to be maybe possible.

14:53.360 --> 15:02.280
So you open the text like this and it knows how to render JSON file in CSV, which is a

15:02.280 --> 15:06.420
format that we all like when we do data journalism.

15:06.420 --> 15:10.940
So you can now analyze all the data that you have.

15:10.940 --> 15:16.520
So that's why I love OpenRefine and also when you want to do some clustering.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.720
And the last one was, of course, R Anti-Diverse.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.320
I'm not going to dive into R Anti-Diverse.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.240
You have had several presentations on that.

15:24.240 --> 15:30.760
But these tools are really easy because R is an easy language for statistics, easy syntax,

15:30.760 --> 15:34.620
very readable when you don't know how to code.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.040
And this is really important for newsroom, for example.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.320
Most of the time, few journalists know how to code.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.720
So having a code that is readable is important.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.220
You get a quick overview.

15:44.220 --> 15:45.400
So we've got 10 minutes, yes.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
Thank you.

15:46.400 --> 15:51.920
It's very convenient for prototyping and important also for reproducibility.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.440
But if you want, you can use Python.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.920
I don't want to enter the war between R and Python.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.920
The motivation.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.240
The motivation, we use Firefox and we dive into the source code.

16:01.240 --> 16:08.880
And this one was pretty easy because Cura2 has a Google ad program inside.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.320
So every click that you made on this web page gives you some money.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.400
So this is the main motivation apart from the ideology.

16:16.400 --> 16:26.120
And about the identity, all the tools that we got from GitHub, Hollehey, Gint, and Sherlock.

16:26.120 --> 16:32.280
These are command line tools that are packaged right now by a French company called APOs.

16:32.280 --> 16:36.980
But you can use them on your terminal and it will help you to dive into the nicknames

16:36.980 --> 16:40.360
and the mail combination on websites.

16:40.360 --> 16:45.900
We also use some leaks, but we found out who was Patrick behind this website.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.300
So let's wrap this up.

16:48.300 --> 16:54.880
First of all, I want to talk about the myth of a single tool in Hoseint.

16:54.880 --> 17:00.280
Most of the time when I say to people, well, I'm a journalist and I work on Hoseint, they

17:00.280 --> 17:01.760
say, oh, which tool do you use?

17:01.760 --> 17:03.280
There are several tools.

17:03.280 --> 17:07.460
There is no single tool in Hoseint and you've got to mix everything.

17:07.460 --> 17:13.800
About this investigation, this guy Patrick is a retired IT technician in a lost town

17:13.800 --> 17:16.680
in the middle of France.

17:16.680 --> 17:23.280
He's a completist, but as we saw, he's in the middle of a bubble of completist influence.

17:23.280 --> 17:29.080
He earns approximately $4,000 a month just by writing crap.

17:29.080 --> 17:36.080
So it's very important for us and for the audience to know him and to help him on the

17:36.080 --> 17:37.080
website.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.440
Patrick, we know who you are.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.680
That's my thing.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.480
Why do we use OpenSoup software?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.520
Because they are powerful, adaptable.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.640
They respect your privacy and reproducibility.

17:49.640 --> 17:53.260
I don't ever know how to pronounce this word.

17:53.260 --> 17:57.640
Most of the time, these tools are free, which is really important and I insist on that.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.240
For journalists, we don't have money.

18:01.240 --> 18:05.440
When you go to Africa and train NGOs, for example, or journalists, it's very complicated

18:05.440 --> 18:06.800
to buy software for them.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.880
They don't even have regular machines.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.440
Having OpenSoup software is really important.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.440
Thank you, you all.

18:13.440 --> 18:19.000
If you code for OpenSoup software, it's really important for civil society.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.560
Thank you.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.680
The last one, collaboration.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.120
I didn't talk about collaboration.

18:25.120 --> 18:31.840
You're in the room today and it's important for us to mention that collaboration on how

18:31.840 --> 18:36.880
our investigation is the key, first of all by software, but also in order to share information

18:36.880 --> 18:40.880
and to share indicators of confirmation, for example.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.800
So data capitalization is important.

18:42.800 --> 18:48.480
There is this project called OpenCTI that I hope we will try to impose in Europe as a

18:48.480 --> 18:49.480
tool.

18:49.480 --> 18:54.920
It's an open source tool and we'll try to impose it as a standard with the DISARM matrix.

18:54.920 --> 18:55.920
It's called DISARM.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.480
All the links are in the presentation in order to get some cooperation.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.480
Thank you very much.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.480
Thank you.

19:01.480 --> 19:09.480
Let's spare a thought for Patrick and on with the questions.

19:09.480 --> 19:20.480
Yes.

19:20.480 --> 19:31.480
You mentioned you used some leaks.

19:31.480 --> 19:36.480
Is that a leaks that you have friends that gave you information or is it that you found

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
things that had been put inadvertently in the public sphere?

19:37.480 --> 19:38.480
Second one, which we try to do when we do some...

19:38.480 --> 19:43.480
We try to do some leaks and the question was, is this information that some friends give

19:43.480 --> 19:47.520
me or information that is publicly available on the internet?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.880
That was the question.

19:48.880 --> 19:56.600
So the answer is as OpenFactory is an NGO, we don't have friends.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.360
So we use public leaks.

19:59.360 --> 20:05.480
We dive on Telegram, the Darknet, et cetera, and we use basically keywords, passwords and

20:05.480 --> 20:11.640
emails in order to make connection between nicknames and try to identify people like

20:11.640 --> 20:12.640
this.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.400
That's what we do.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.840
We also have a sort of...

20:17.840 --> 20:25.320
I'm a former investigative journalist, an investigator, so what I try to do is sort of judicial methodology.

20:25.320 --> 20:30.880
So we try to open everything in our investigation and we mention all the information that we

20:30.880 --> 20:31.880
get.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.280
So if we link from somewhere on the internet, we will explain where we got the leak every

20:36.280 --> 20:37.800
time.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.400
Transparency is important.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.400
Another question here?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.400
I have a question.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.400
Are you Jewish?

20:42.400 --> 20:43.400
No, I'm not.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.400
Okay.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.400
The question was, I'm a Jewish.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.400
No, I'm not.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
I'm not Jewish.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
Other question?

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
Yes.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.400
I mean, you mentioned like one particular question.

20:53.400 --> 21:03.760
That you identified, but I mean, I guess there are more people.

21:03.760 --> 21:13.400
What is the scope of the success of this program?

21:13.400 --> 21:17.880
The question is that we identify one person behind this website and there are probably

21:17.880 --> 21:20.240
more people and more websites like this.

21:20.240 --> 21:24.800
So we are just a bunch of cool people working behind their computer.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.400
So we try to do our best, but at least we have one website which is really influenced.

21:29.400 --> 21:35.200
So we start by the most productive website that we want to investigate, but of course

21:35.200 --> 21:40.720
there are millions, not millions, but thousands and thousands of people doing these kind of

21:40.720 --> 21:41.720
things.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.680
We do what we can and we're trying to inspire other journalists in order to make their own

21:45.680 --> 21:50.680
investigation and to help these kind of people.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.680
Sorry.

21:51.680 --> 21:57.680
How big is the environment of NGO working on this kind of subject?

21:57.680 --> 21:59.680
Are you the only one?

21:59.680 --> 22:04.560
Are you a lot of NGOs and friends working on this information?

22:04.560 --> 22:08.760
The question is, are we a lot of people, for example, in France working on this information?

22:08.760 --> 22:14.320
There are some newspaper and newsroom that start to investigate on these kind of topics.

22:14.320 --> 22:19.040
It's not very popular, not very famous, but I think that the last three or four years,

22:19.040 --> 22:23.720
this information has become a major issue, especially in Europe.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.920
And we see plenty of NGOs such as EU, this info lab, for example.

22:27.920 --> 22:33.280
They are friends of ours and we really like them and we try to collaborate with them.

22:33.280 --> 22:39.560
So yeah, I hope that we'll get more and more people in order to work on that.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.560
Other question?

22:40.560 --> 22:44.560
How can you stop automatic disinformation?

22:44.560 --> 22:48.160
So I'm thinking about chat GPT and bots and stuff like that.

22:48.160 --> 22:53.040
So can you distinguish whether it's being auto-generated or human-generated?

22:53.040 --> 23:01.320
So the question is that, how can we stop automatic disinformation made, for example, by chat GPT?

23:01.320 --> 23:08.920
Chat GPT is going to be a very big issue for influence, which is something pretty obvious.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.560
When I'm saying that, I'm saying obvious thing.

23:11.560 --> 23:17.160
But yeah, it's going to be a problem because websites, especially search engines, they

23:17.160 --> 23:22.600
use, as I mentioned, SEO technique in order to do the ranking of the website.

23:22.600 --> 23:30.520
And one of the biggest issues, for example, for Google will be to figure out if a content

23:30.520 --> 23:37.040
not only is duplicated, which was pretty easy to do, but now automatically connected.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.120
So I don't have any solution for the moment.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.280
We haven't faced this problem so far.

23:41.280 --> 23:48.080
Chat GPT is quite recent, and its use is not widespread right now, but it's going to change

23:48.080 --> 23:50.320
within the next six months.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.720
And I'm sure about that.

23:51.720 --> 23:57.760
As an answer to this gentleman's question, the OpenAIG recently launched a site where

23:57.760 --> 23:59.760
you can give an effect.

23:59.760 --> 24:04.760
It will give you a confidence level if it's human-generated or computer-generated.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.760
Yeah.

24:05.760 --> 24:11.000
Could you please give a red-noth visualization again?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Sorry, sorry.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
The height of the page?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yep.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Sorry.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
This one.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, I was curious about the labeling you did of the notes.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.040
Could you explain more about the color classification?

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
The label?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.040
Yes.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.160
So the label is basically the title of the website?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.160
Yeah, sorry, the coloring.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.360
Ah, the coloring.

24:29.360 --> 24:35.360
We used the betweenness centrality on this graph.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.360
Okay.

24:36.360 --> 24:44.320
So it's usually what I do on this kind of website in order to figure out the importance

24:44.320 --> 24:51.640
of a node as a distributor of the connections between other sub-communities.

24:51.640 --> 24:52.640
So yeah.

24:52.640 --> 24:58.360
Because American clusters, I'm just curious about your clustering.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.360
Ah, okay.

24:59.360 --> 25:06.360
The distribution, you mean, for example, all the links, it's basically the standard,

25:06.360 --> 25:07.360
Gephi...

25:07.360 --> 25:08.360
No?

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
No, no, no.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.360
The specialization?

25:10.360 --> 25:11.360
What?

25:11.360 --> 25:12.360
For SATLAS too.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.360
For SATLAS too.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.360
For SATLAS.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.360
So it's this one?

25:16.360 --> 25:17.360
Yeah, this one.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
So it's for SATLAS.

25:18.360 --> 25:28.360
So every link that is close to the other one will be packed as itself and a group, a group

25:28.360 --> 25:34.360
cluster that is not very linked to another one will be far away from the other one.

25:34.360 --> 25:50.260
There is a bias in the representation because I wanted Q-A

25:50.260 --> 26:06.880
to be clear.

26:06.880 --> 26:14.480
First of all, when you work on this information, so the question is how can we make the distinction

26:14.480 --> 26:16.800
between misinformation and disinformation?

26:16.800 --> 26:20.920
So basically when you start an investigation, this is the first question that you ask yourself.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.920
Is it going to be disinformation or misinformation?

26:23.920 --> 26:31.480
Misinformation is like something that could be true, but no, that is false, but the person

26:31.480 --> 26:33.240
thinks it's true.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.240
Okay?

26:34.240 --> 26:38.800
But when you see the content of the website, you know that he's talking always on the same

26:38.800 --> 26:42.060
topics, always distributing the same kind of information.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.320
So you know that he does this deliberately.

26:44.320 --> 26:49.200
The motivation is important and that's why in this case it was important to identify

26:49.200 --> 26:55.680
the Google Ads tag because you know for sure that its motivation is probably ideology,

26:55.680 --> 27:02.880
probably, if you see his Facebook wall, for example, but there is the money and the ads

27:02.880 --> 27:08.720
and the Google and the platform are fueling the disinformation with the ad system.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.720
So this is really important to identify.

27:10.720 --> 27:19.240
Okay, last question over there.

27:19.240 --> 27:33.800
I didn't get the question, sorry.

27:33.800 --> 27:39.640
So is there a strategy from, the question is that is there a strategy to tackle disinformation

27:39.640 --> 27:41.960
from authoritarian states?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.920
I think so.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.300
The problem is that everybody, everyone has its own strategy.

27:47.300 --> 27:50.920
So there are millions of strategy and this is the big issue according to me.

27:50.920 --> 27:56.640
So Europe, for example, is trying to organize this by different programs.

27:56.640 --> 28:05.560
EU Dizinfo Lab, like is the leader in trying to federate the Dizinfo structure and activist

28:05.560 --> 28:09.640
in order to make wider and bigger investigation like this.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.320
So I think yes, there is a strategy.

28:12.320 --> 28:17.600
The problem is that for the moment there are multiple strategy, but it's going to change.

28:17.600 --> 28:30.800
Thank you.
