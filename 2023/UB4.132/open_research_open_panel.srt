1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.840
Okay, so basically we had this extra slot of time in our physical session.

2
0:00:13.840 --> 0:00:21.240
Actually, the, well, we want to use that time to engage the session with you, the audience,

3
0:00:21.240 --> 0:00:27.760
about this open research track here at FOSDEM.

4
0:00:27.760 --> 0:00:38.160
Before opening the stage for basically questions and discussions, just wanted to very briefly

5
0:00:38.160 --> 0:00:43.800
say a few words about how we ended up creating this space.

6
0:00:43.800 --> 0:00:27.760
So basically we've been with a few colleagues at S

7
0:00:49.600 --> 0:00:57.720
Poppari, for instance, doing a few conferences here at FOSDEM in other dev rooms, using this

8
0:00:57.720 --> 0:01:03.360
FOSDEM conference as a venue to actually talk about technical realizations we were doing

9
0:01:03.360 --> 0:01:05.120
in the lab.

10
0:01:05.120 --> 0:01:11.840
And it was not so, it was a very good opportunity for us because it's not easy to do a scientific

11
0:01:11.840 --> 0:01:18.360
publication about technical things, more specifically into the social sciences.

12
0:01:18.360 --> 0:01:25.680
So after a few years of doing that, we thought that actually we could try to go a step further

13
0:01:25.680 --> 0:01:32.560
on this by organizing this track, which is definitely about open source software and

14
0:01:32.560 --> 0:01:34.560
research.

15
0:01:34.560 --> 0:01:40.480
And so we had, as you've seen, we understand research with a very broad way.

16
0:01:40.480 --> 0:01:47.440
Any kind of inquiry is, we think, interesting to discuss because the share, a journalist

17
0:01:47.440 --> 0:01:56.480
investigator, we had an open factor, for instance, our social scientists, our natural scientists,

18
0:01:56.480 --> 0:02:01.200
all share kind of the same engagement with data about inquiry.

19
0:02:01.200 --> 0:02:06.160
So we created this room four years ago.

20
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:12.320
Actually at the time we merged with another initiative from two people from neuroscience.

21
0:02:12.320 --> 0:02:18.760
And it was nice also to have these different disciplines.

22
0:02:18.760 --> 0:02:25.720
Of course, then the COVID came, so we succeeded into keeping the room online.

23
0:02:25.720 --> 0:02:30.880
And now, so we have a crew of five, six people.

24
0:02:30.880 --> 0:02:40.080
We have two people who are online, Yohudi and Celia Grison-Daniel, who will actually

25
0:02:40.080 --> 0:02:48.280
monitor from their home the online session, which will start in 20 minutes.

26
0:02:48.280 --> 0:02:54.520
And basically we are a bunch of people working in academia or not, or in an open knowledge

27
0:02:54.520 --> 0:02:56.480
foundation.

28
0:02:56.480 --> 0:03:00.000
And I have no more in academia myself.

29
0:03:00.000 --> 0:03:07.960
And so the first thing I would like to say is like volunteers to help us out organizing

30
0:03:07.960 --> 0:03:11.960
this space are more than welcome.

31
0:03:11.960 --> 0:03:18.640
Basically the work of this starts in the autumn where we submit a proposal to first them to

32
0:03:18.640 --> 0:03:20.360
organize this room again.

33
0:03:20.360 --> 0:03:21.720
So each year we do that.

34
0:03:21.720 --> 0:03:22.720
We wait for the answer.

35
0:03:22.720 --> 0:03:27.880
And once we have it, we have to do a call of proposal for something very, very classic

36
0:03:27.880 --> 0:03:31.360
about organizing a conference.

37
0:03:31.360 --> 0:03:34.880
So reviewing papers, actually getting the papers in.

38
0:03:34.880 --> 0:03:41.480
So we actually contact people for asking them to come to our conference.

39
0:03:41.480 --> 0:03:46.360
And then, as you've seen, what we did today, mining the door, putting signs on people and

40
0:03:46.360 --> 0:03:50.600
that kind of stuff, which is fun.

41
0:03:50.600 --> 0:03:54.160
And yeah, so I will finish with that.

42
0:03:54.160 --> 0:03:56.480
And maybe some other people won't say other things.

43
0:03:56.480 --> 0:03:57.480
I will finish this with one thing.

44
0:03:57.480 --> 0:04:07.200
The other thing is it's important for us to try to augment diversity of our group.

45
0:04:07.200 --> 0:04:08.600
Gender but also disciplines.

46
0:04:08.600 --> 0:04:14.680
We'd like to open up as much discipline as we can.

47
0:04:14.680 --> 0:04:15.680
So yeah.

48
0:04:15.680 --> 0:04:16.680
Sorry?

49
0:04:16.680 --> 0:04:17.680
Less French people.

50
0:04:17.680 --> 0:04:20.600
Less, yeah, and diversity.

51
0:04:20.600 --> 0:04:24.560
So there is a question about, yes, yes, also less French people.

52
0:04:24.560 --> 0:04:28.000
We tried that, we succeeded a little bit, but not that much.

53
0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:29.000
So yes, please.

54
0:04:29.000 --> 0:04:30.000
Matthew.

55
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:33.880
Yeah, I just wanted to say a few things.

56
0:04:33.880 --> 0:04:41.920
But basically, the reason we need you is also to increase this diversity in the papers submitted.

57
0:04:41.920 --> 0:04:46.960
Because for instance, if you look at the gender balance, the committee is basically gender

58
0:04:46.960 --> 0:04:48.960
balanced.

59
0:04:48.960 --> 0:04:53.260
But the submissions are completely dominated by males.

60
0:04:53.260 --> 0:05:02.680
And also, the deaf room in the beginning had one leg firmly into the hard sciences.

61
0:05:02.680 --> 0:05:05.720
But then we've kind of drifted towards the social sciences.

62
0:05:05.720 --> 0:05:07.760
And it's not just us, it's also the demand.

63
0:05:07.760 --> 0:05:10.240
So we try to prompt something.

64
0:05:10.240 --> 0:05:18.440
But it's kind of a balance game to try to have this variety in the proposals in the

65
0:05:18.440 --> 0:05:19.440
first place.

66
0:05:19.440 --> 0:05:24.440
Because if we don't have any proposition, for instance, in hard sciences, we're not

67
0:05:24.440 --> 0:05:25.800
going to have any.

68
0:05:25.800 --> 0:05:32.680
So the audience, which is like, if you submit papers, or if you come to the committee and

69
0:05:32.680 --> 0:05:38.560
then become a bridge to contact other people to submit papers, that's how we can kind of

70
0:05:38.560 --> 0:05:42.200
ensure that it remains diverse.

71
0:05:42.200 --> 0:05:49.120
It's not a lot of work to participate, also because we are many, and we are probably going

72
0:05:49.120 --> 0:05:50.600
to get even more people.

73
0:05:50.600 --> 0:05:58.120
And it's not a problem to be many, because the real job beyond managing the day is, as

74
0:05:58.120 --> 0:06:02.560
you said, to contact the people and then to review, but mostly to contact them.

75
0:06:02.560 --> 0:06:06.120
So please come in and join us about that.

76
0:06:06.120 --> 0:06:10.520
But we could also have this discussion about what the scope of that should be.

77
0:06:10.520 --> 0:06:15.320
Because I think that the figure of the tool maker was kind of at the center of what we

78
0:06:15.320 --> 0:06:17.400
had in mind.

79
0:06:17.400 --> 0:06:19.640
But as we see, it's not just about tools.

80
0:06:19.640 --> 0:06:25.200
It can also be about infrastructure in ways that is not tools, like institutions.

81
0:06:25.200 --> 0:06:26.200
I don't know.

82
0:06:26.200 --> 0:06:29.720
I'm thinking of the journal of open source software that we had a few years back.

83
0:06:29.720 --> 0:06:31.760
Infrastructure is not just tools.

84
0:06:31.760 --> 0:06:32.760
So now it's clear.

85
0:06:32.760 --> 0:06:34.040
It's not just the tool makers.

86
0:06:34.040 --> 0:06:36.840
They said the infrastructure maker.

87
0:06:36.840 --> 0:06:42.280
And what could it be like common and shape the profile of the room with us?

88
0:06:42.280 --> 0:06:51.080
Can I just to emphasize what you said, can I just share my experience from this?

89
0:06:51.080 --> 0:06:52.080
Go ahead.

90
0:06:52.080 --> 0:06:53.080
Take the mic.

91
0:06:53.080 --> 0:06:43.220
Since my first time at First

92
0:07:00.080 --> 0:07:01.080
Time, and I went to talk about it.

93
0:07:01.080 --> 0:07:03.680
But just to emphasize what Matt just said, this was my first time at First Time.

94
0:07:03.680 --> 0:07:05.680
And as I told you, I'm not a coder.

95
0:07:05.680 --> 0:07:12.400
So I was pretty scared about what I was going to say and share, et cetera, et cetera.

96
0:07:12.400 --> 0:07:14.720
So please do it.

97
0:07:14.720 --> 0:07:22.560
Because why I came here was to share knowledge, of course, but to retrieve some different

98
0:07:22.560 --> 0:07:29.440
experience from what I do every day and who the people are with whom I work every day.

99
0:07:29.440 --> 0:07:31.680
So thank you for this.

100
0:07:31.680 --> 0:07:36.160
And please submit papers.

101
0:07:36.160 --> 0:07:40.280
Yeah.

102
0:07:40.280 --> 0:07:41.280
You want the mic?

103
0:07:41.280 --> 0:07:42.280
Yeah.

104
0:07:42.280 --> 0:07:43.280
Yeah.

105
0:07:43.280 --> 0:08:04.320
I think one challenge for the diversity is that there's also the good way to use open

106
0:08:04.320 --> 0:08:12.960
ITK solutions and design on them.

107
0:08:12.960 --> 0:08:27.900
And it's about how we can find how to tweak a real type of

108
0:08:27.900 --> 0:08:30.900
hey, we also use Excel.

109
0:08:30.900 --> 0:08:32.980
It's sort of a bad thing for a practice

110
0:08:32.980 --> 0:08:36.140
that people look at strangely, or even if it's

111
0:08:36.140 --> 0:08:39.260
like LibreOffice, which I think is a good source.

112
0:08:39.260 --> 0:08:41.140
But it's not the death wave.

113
0:08:41.140 --> 0:08:46.960
And I guess that vibe that people catch that

114
0:08:46.960 --> 0:08:48.460
would make also a lot of people that

115
0:08:48.460 --> 0:08:51.220
would be very interesting for this community

116
0:08:51.220 --> 0:08:55.340
to also see how it's done in the real world in a very messy way

117
0:08:55.340 --> 0:08:57.840
very often.

118
0:08:57.840 --> 0:09:00.340
So may stem not by that.

119
0:09:00.340 --> 0:09:04.300
And if we could get to a place where this would be legit

120
0:09:04.300 --> 0:09:07.140
and people would be curious and interested

121
0:09:07.140 --> 0:09:12.900
in those non-perfect, chaotic, and not 100% open source ways,

122
0:09:12.900 --> 0:09:15.860
I think that would increase diversity law.

123
0:09:15.860 --> 0:09:19.300
So just for the stream, the idea that a challenge to diversity

124
0:09:19.300 --> 0:09:21.840
could be that there are good ways and bad ways

125
0:09:21.840 --> 0:09:24.120
to do open source.

126
0:09:24.120 --> 0:09:27.460
And where I say that, I forgot the last part of your speech.

127
0:09:27.460 --> 0:09:32.140
The Excel LibreOffice part is important.

128
0:09:32.140 --> 0:09:33.300
He's going to come back later.

129
0:09:33.300 --> 0:09:33.800
I'm sorry.

130
0:09:33.800 --> 0:09:35.140
I'm so tired.

131
0:09:35.140 --> 0:09:36.740
It was for the stream.

132
0:09:36.740 --> 0:09:38.300
Yeah, that's what the point was.

133
0:09:38.300 --> 0:09:41.860
But I mean, you were very right that it's about us

134
0:09:41.860 --> 0:09:43.740
to cultivate that.

135
0:09:43.740 --> 0:09:45.700
Yeah, it comes back to me now.

136
0:09:45.700 --> 0:09:47.780
It's really important to show how

137
0:09:47.780 --> 0:09:50.580
it's being done in the real world.

138
0:09:50.580 --> 0:09:52.700
That's something that I think we all

139
0:09:52.700 --> 0:09:55.060
appreciate very much about the first dimension in general.

140
0:09:55.060 --> 0:09:57.780
You don't see some people talking from a distance

141
0:09:57.780 --> 0:09:59.380
about how it's supposed to be.

142
0:09:59.380 --> 0:10:03.460
You have real people who are from actually doing stuff, which

143
0:10:03.460 --> 0:10:05.100
also means that sometimes they are not

144
0:10:05.100 --> 0:10:06.540
really good at communicating.

145
0:10:06.540 --> 0:10:08.460
And that's something that I really appreciate,

146
0:10:08.460 --> 0:10:10.900
because you hear the voices.

147
0:10:10.900 --> 0:10:13.580
I think the first dimension is somehow a safe space for people

148
0:10:13.580 --> 0:10:16.260
who are not primarily good at communicating,

149
0:10:16.260 --> 0:10:18.220
contrary to academics, for instance,

150
0:10:18.220 --> 0:10:20.700
but who are really doing the stuff.

151
0:10:20.700 --> 0:10:22.460
And we can hear them.

152
0:10:22.460 --> 0:10:25.300
And we can identify to them and realize

153
0:10:25.300 --> 0:10:29.300
that anyone can get involved in open science and open source

154
0:10:29.300 --> 0:10:29.820
design.

155
0:10:29.820 --> 0:10:31.780
We want very much to keep cultivating that.

156
0:10:31.780 --> 0:10:34.780
That's why also we try to have a blend of people showing off

157
0:10:34.780 --> 0:10:37.260
the tools they've made, but also people

158
0:10:37.260 --> 0:10:39.140
having a different kind of talk.

159
0:10:39.140 --> 0:10:40.660
I don't know what the right balance is,

160
0:10:40.660 --> 0:10:54.820
but we want to preserve this voice.

161
0:10:54.820 --> 0:10:55.820
It's one question.

162
0:11:00.820 --> 0:11:04.460
During my research, at some point during my PhD,

163
0:11:04.460 --> 0:11:07.620
I was part of a training workshop

164
0:11:07.620 --> 0:11:13.900
led by PhD students in product training of cells

165
0:11:13.900 --> 0:11:15.860
with best practices in mind and also

166
0:11:15.860 --> 0:11:19.020
to have a grassroots initiative, which

167
0:11:19.020 --> 0:11:22.220
I think is a good example of what

168
0:11:22.220 --> 0:11:24.180
works in a particular field.

169
0:11:24.180 --> 0:11:31.020
Is this kind of stories of what works in a particular domain

170
0:11:31.020 --> 0:11:35.540
would that be a thing interesting for this level?

171
0:11:35.540 --> 0:11:38.060
So are stories that work in a particular domain

172
0:11:38.060 --> 0:11:40.020
interesting for the dev room?

173
0:11:40.020 --> 0:11:43.380
Well, for me, I think it totally is.

174
0:11:43.380 --> 0:11:44.860
So the answer is yes.

175
0:11:44.860 --> 0:11:46.420
And I think we've somehow done that.

176
0:11:46.420 --> 0:11:49.780
But sometimes what it looks, once it's in the slides

177
0:11:49.780 --> 0:11:50.980
and here, it looks different.

178
0:11:50.980 --> 0:11:54.140
But that is very much the case.

179
0:11:54.140 --> 0:11:58.180
I think we do not have a clear typology of the kind of talks

180
0:11:58.180 --> 0:12:00.140
we accept.

181
0:12:00.140 --> 0:12:03.380
One very clear kind is the tool talk.

182
0:12:03.380 --> 0:12:06.660
I've done something, I show you that to you.

183
0:12:06.660 --> 0:12:09.740
Another kind would be experiment feedback.

184
0:12:09.740 --> 0:12:11.260
So I'm not going to show my tool.

185
0:12:11.260 --> 0:12:13.900
But for instance, I have engaged with that open source stack.

186
0:12:13.900 --> 0:12:15.180
And I've met issues.

187
0:12:15.180 --> 0:12:17.940
I'm going to talk about that.

188
0:12:17.940 --> 0:12:19.820
This is a little bit of that kind somehow.

189
0:12:22.700 --> 0:12:27.300
Do you think it would be good to add the small track dedicated

190
0:12:27.300 --> 0:12:29.660
to very short talks like lightning talks,

191
0:12:29.660 --> 0:12:34.020
but dedicated to?

192
0:12:34.020 --> 0:12:35.620
Repeat the question.

193
0:12:35.620 --> 0:12:39.460
So a question like, would it be a good idea

194
0:12:39.460 --> 0:12:42.540
to organize lightning, very short lightning talks

195
0:12:42.540 --> 0:12:44.580
about open research?

196
0:12:44.580 --> 0:12:46.780
So actually, we try to do that a little bit.

197
0:12:46.780 --> 0:12:49.260
Like, the three last talks were lightning.

198
0:12:49.260 --> 0:12:52.300
OK, lightning's 15 minutes.

199
0:12:52.300 --> 0:12:54.740
But I think it's, yeah.

200
0:12:54.740 --> 0:12:55.460
So we try.

201
0:12:55.460 --> 0:12:57.300
Actually, so the format lightning or not

202
0:12:57.300 --> 0:12:59.180
depends on the time we have.

203
0:12:59.180 --> 0:13:02.020
And what the speaker wants.

204
0:13:02.020 --> 0:13:04.220
So it basically is a tool.

205
0:13:04.220 --> 0:13:05.740
If you don't know how it works, people

206
0:13:05.740 --> 0:13:09.580
propose if they want a lightning talk or a normal talk.

207
0:13:09.580 --> 0:13:13.620
And then so we can also ask them to expand or reduce

208
0:13:13.620 --> 0:13:15.460
if we think it fits better.

209
0:13:15.460 --> 0:13:16.460
So we try to negotiate.

210
0:13:16.460 --> 0:13:19.060
But it's kind of unpredictable how many lightning talks

211
0:13:19.060 --> 0:13:20.340
we're going to have.

212
0:13:20.340 --> 0:13:25.300
So the proposals decide if there is enough for a tracker or not.

213
0:13:25.300 --> 0:13:26.900
From the two last questions, there

214
0:13:26.900 --> 0:13:29.900
is one thing that's very important that's emerging.

215
0:13:29.900 --> 0:13:34.860
So the form of things should be in question.

216
0:13:34.860 --> 0:13:39.660
And there is a sort of standardization associated

217
0:13:39.660 --> 0:13:41.580
with a conference.

218
0:13:41.580 --> 0:13:47.220
And as we receive talk, we perceive diversity,

219
0:13:47.220 --> 0:13:52.900
even in the form and or experiences, tools, or maybe

220
0:13:52.900 --> 0:13:53.400
talk.

221
0:13:53.400 --> 0:13:55.180
We do have a classifications.

222
0:13:55.180 --> 0:13:59.700
But seeing things here, it's sort of standardized.

223
0:13:59.700 --> 0:14:02.300
And maybe we should work together,

224
0:14:02.300 --> 0:14:05.220
so you're in this with us, on the form of things,

225
0:14:05.220 --> 0:14:08.540
on maybe other forms of presentations.

226
0:14:08.540 --> 0:14:10.700
We're not that constrained by the first them.

227
0:14:10.700 --> 0:14:17.860
So that's one way we could work forward into.

228
0:14:17.860 --> 0:14:20.300
But there are many things we could do.

229
0:14:20.300 --> 0:14:25.300
And I am Todd.

230
0:14:25.300 --> 0:14:27.780
I do have very much.

231
0:14:27.780 --> 0:14:32.260
I am part of your special community.

232
0:14:32.260 --> 0:14:37.260
And on the two side of the conference,

233
0:14:37.260 --> 0:14:40.260
we have the same programs.

234
0:14:40.260 --> 0:14:45.260
We have lots of developers who want to speak of their own.

235
0:14:45.260 --> 0:14:47.260
And the new teams and the new stuff,

236
0:14:47.260 --> 0:14:53.260
they have to do the program to have users who are speaking

237
0:14:53.260 --> 0:15:00.740
of how they use the tools and use KADs around.

238
0:15:00.740 --> 0:15:03.740
And it's very difficult. And it's pretty hard

239
0:15:03.740 --> 0:15:07.220
to keep the academic.

240
0:15:07.220 --> 0:15:08.700
We do have a colleague.

241
0:15:08.700 --> 0:15:10.180
I asked her for a film.

242
0:15:10.180 --> 0:15:11.660
And she put out her book.

243
0:15:11.660 --> 0:15:14.660
And she put it here.

244
0:15:14.660 --> 0:15:18.060
I asked her for the movie.

245
0:15:18.060 --> 0:15:22.060
And I came here on the area.

246
0:15:22.060 --> 0:15:24.060
She said, I don't speak.

247
0:15:24.060 --> 0:15:25.460
I'm not a developer.

248
0:15:25.460 --> 0:15:30.460
It's not the kind of meeting for me.

249
0:15:30.460 --> 0:15:34.460
So maybe we can speak a little bit.

250
0:15:34.460 --> 0:15:37.460
And she said, it's very open to everyone, not just the number.

251
0:15:37.460 --> 0:15:43.460
And I don't have the answer.

252
0:15:43.460 --> 0:15:45.500
the question in the comment was that in the,

253
0:15:45.500 --> 0:15:48.140
Nicolas says that in the Joe special,

254
0:15:48.140 --> 0:15:49.180
the dev room or community,

255
0:15:49.180 --> 0:15:51.060
they also have this issue of having users come

256
0:15:51.060 --> 0:15:52.340
because they don't feel welcome

257
0:15:52.340 --> 0:15:54.140
or they don't feel like they fit.

258
0:15:54.140 --> 0:15:55.700
So I want to give the mic to Maya

259
0:15:55.700 --> 0:15:57.680
because Maya was first,

260
0:15:57.680 --> 0:15:59.120
before she got in the committee for the room,

261
0:15:59.120 --> 0:16:02.260
she was presenting a talk here two years ago, I think.

262
0:16:02.260 --> 0:16:03.100
2020.

263
0:16:04.540 --> 0:16:08.020
As a user, so now you are in.

264
0:16:08.020 --> 0:16:10.920
So what would you give as an advice to those guys?

265
0:16:10.920 --> 0:16:13.680
Don't be scared, they're really nice.

266
0:16:16.080 --> 0:16:19.080
I understand your colleague perfectly,

267
0:16:19.080 --> 0:16:20.520
especially coming from academia,

268
0:16:20.520 --> 0:16:23.400
which is also my case.

269
0:16:23.400 --> 0:16:26.040
Academia is extremely segmented

270
0:16:26.040 --> 0:16:31.040
and we're taught to fear each other deeply.

271
0:16:32.400 --> 0:16:34.320
And so it can be really scary

272
0:16:34.320 --> 0:16:36.560
to push those boundaries a little bit.

273
0:16:38.200 --> 0:16:39.880
It can also be very rewarding.

274
0:16:39.880 --> 0:16:44.240
So you said she did come in 2020 or she didn't come?

275
0:16:44.240 --> 0:16:45.080
Okay.

276
0:16:45.080 --> 0:16:47.640
I tried two concurrency for them

277
0:16:47.640 --> 0:16:52.880
and the one I organized and the...

278
0:16:52.880 --> 0:16:57.520
Okay, so despite trying, there was no success yet.

279
0:16:57.520 --> 0:17:00.980
Maybe if you show them this replay,

280
0:17:02.440 --> 0:17:03.680
it will change everything.

281
0:17:07.160 --> 0:17:08.080
I got a question for you,

282
0:17:08.080 --> 0:17:12.560
which is, so one of our ideas or objective organizations

283
0:17:12.560 --> 0:17:15.900
was also to bring folks from academia here at the first time

284
0:17:15.900 --> 0:17:17.120
so that they can actually benefit

285
0:17:17.120 --> 0:17:19.500
from the other conference in all the dev rooms.

286
0:17:19.500 --> 0:17:20.880
So here's my questions like,

287
0:17:22.060 --> 0:17:24.320
do you consider seeing talks in other dev rooms

288
0:17:24.320 --> 0:17:26.920
and this one here, yourselves?

289
0:17:26.920 --> 0:17:28.560
Can you raise your hand if you do?

290
0:17:30.360 --> 0:17:32.000
Yeah, it's good.

291
0:17:32.000 --> 0:17:32.840
Yes.

292
0:17:32.840 --> 0:17:34.000
I'd like to.

293
0:17:34.000 --> 0:17:34.840
Yeah.

294
0:17:34.840 --> 0:17:39.840
So much, I think there is a lot of talk

295
0:17:39.840 --> 0:17:41.120
in the dev room.

296
0:17:41.120 --> 0:17:41.960
Yeah, yeah.

297
0:17:41.960 --> 0:17:45.960
It's difficult to see all the talks that we want to see,

298
0:17:45.960 --> 0:17:47.600
even though the offer is large.

299
0:17:48.760 --> 0:17:51.880
But, and conversely, who is here now,

300
0:17:51.880 --> 0:17:55.720
but who didn't come to the FOSDEM specifically for that?

301
0:17:55.720 --> 0:17:57.360
Okay, raise your hands.

302
0:17:57.360 --> 0:17:59.160
So it works also the other way around.

303
0:17:59.160 --> 0:18:00.000
Okay.

304
0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:01.560
Yeah, it's good.

305
0:18:01.560 --> 0:18:02.400
Thank you.

306
0:18:02.400 --> 0:18:03.240
Amazing.

307
0:18:03.240 --> 0:18:05.080
Okay.

308
0:18:05.080 --> 0:18:07.200
Is it time?

309
0:18:07.200 --> 0:18:08.040
No, not yet.

310
0:18:08.040 --> 0:18:09.560
So we still have 10 minutes.

311
0:18:10.440 --> 0:18:13.520
Then we'll actually watch the stream here,

312
0:18:13.520 --> 0:18:14.460
if you want to stay.

313
0:18:15.960 --> 0:18:16.800
Just a quick question.

314
0:18:16.800 --> 0:18:19.440
What is the acceptance rate here?

315
0:18:19.440 --> 0:18:20.640
That's a very good question.

316
0:18:20.640 --> 0:18:23.960
So the question is, what is the acceptance rate?

317
0:18:23.960 --> 0:18:24.980
I don't know.

318
0:18:24.980 --> 0:18:27.280
We haven't calculated it, but I think.

319
0:18:27.280 --> 0:18:30.000
It's not a rate, but it hasn't happened.

320
0:18:30.000 --> 0:18:32.040
I guess we...

321
0:18:32.040 --> 0:18:34.600
I would say that there is a part of the papers

322
0:18:34.600 --> 0:18:37.640
that are not good.

323
0:18:37.640 --> 0:18:40.400
I mean, they're out of focus for the dev room.

324
0:18:41.320 --> 0:18:42.720
And what we can do, actually,

325
0:18:42.720 --> 0:18:44.480
we can reroute a paper to other dev rooms.

326
0:18:44.480 --> 0:18:45.360
So it doesn't matter much.

327
0:18:45.360 --> 0:18:48.200
But also some people just submit to multiple dev rooms

328
0:18:48.200 --> 0:18:49.760
for the same speech, right?

329
0:18:49.760 --> 0:18:51.840
So, and it's okay, right?

330
0:18:51.840 --> 0:18:53.840
The boundaries are not super open.

331
0:18:53.840 --> 0:18:55.720
There are kind of buggy proposals.

332
0:18:55.720 --> 0:18:58.560
What we would consider not acceptable would be,

333
0:18:58.560 --> 0:19:01.080
is that something that is clearly for someone else,

334
0:19:01.080 --> 0:19:02.480
and we don't know why it's been submitted here,

335
0:19:02.480 --> 0:19:04.160
or something that has just a title.

336
0:19:05.120 --> 0:19:06.640
When that happened, we would kind of send an email.

337
0:19:06.640 --> 0:19:08.120
Sometimes we don't even have an answer.

338
0:19:08.120 --> 0:19:09.840
We don't know what happens.

339
0:19:09.840 --> 0:19:11.000
So if you remove those,

340
0:19:11.000 --> 0:19:14.120
the ones that we actually refuse,

341
0:19:14.120 --> 0:19:18.080
I think is like one third, one quarter, maybe,

342
0:19:18.080 --> 0:19:19.480
with not too much.

343
0:19:19.480 --> 0:19:22.040
So we are always, it's been always working for us.

344
0:19:22.040 --> 0:19:24.120
We need to have enough to fill the day,

345
0:19:24.120 --> 0:19:25.520
if we want to have a full day.

346
0:19:26.600 --> 0:19:29.820
But not too much that we have to refuse a lot of good talks.

347
0:19:29.820 --> 0:19:33.680
But to be honest, we've been refusing good talks every year.

348
0:19:34.880 --> 0:19:36.680
Just because there's not enough room.

349
0:19:38.140 --> 0:19:40.680
So basically, we decide about the balance

350
0:19:40.680 --> 0:19:41.640
when it's the case.

351
0:19:41.640 --> 0:19:44.520
So we have like too many or not enough tool talks.

352
0:19:44.520 --> 0:19:46.200
We will try to adjust this way.

353
0:19:47.680 --> 0:19:50.560
I can remember that one kind of a talk

354
0:19:50.560 --> 0:19:54.280
that we tend to reject are talks about tools

355
0:19:54.280 --> 0:19:57.300
that have been developed somewhere in research,

356
0:19:57.300 --> 0:19:59.400
but which is very specific.

357
0:19:59.400 --> 0:20:02.480
In a very specific domain, without any abstract,

358
0:20:02.480 --> 0:20:05.920
without any issues about what does open source side

359
0:20:05.920 --> 0:20:09.600
of the thing actually change anything in the story.

360
0:20:09.600 --> 0:20:12.280
So I mean, just a paper about the tool,

361
0:20:12.280 --> 0:20:14.040
which is in research,

362
0:20:14.040 --> 0:20:15.760
depends out of the quality of the abstract,

363
0:20:15.760 --> 0:20:18.420
but yeah, it's not enough in a way.

364
0:20:20.400 --> 0:20:23.520
Submitting is very, the abstract to submit is like,

365
0:20:23.520 --> 0:20:25.840
so a few paragraphs long, so it's really easy to submit.

366
0:20:25.840 --> 0:20:30.840
It's very easy to submit, please do. Yes?

367
0:20:30.840 --> 0:20:34.840
I did write about the young receptionist organization.

368
0:20:34.840 --> 0:20:37.920
So I was the first member of the Italian

369
0:20:37.920 --> 0:20:39.920
and PhD student association.

370
0:20:39.920 --> 0:20:40.760
Okay.

371
0:20:40.760 --> 0:20:42.200
You mentioned they, maybe.

372
0:20:42.200 --> 0:20:43.640
Good idea.

373
0:20:43.640 --> 0:20:48.000
So the question is like, have we tried PhD associations,

374
0:20:48.000 --> 0:20:50.840
a session of PhD students to email them,

375
0:20:50.840 --> 0:20:52.600
to propose them to submit a talk?

376
0:20:52.600 --> 0:20:53.560
No, we haven't.

377
0:20:53.560 --> 0:20:55.560
No, we haven't.

378
0:20:55.560 --> 0:20:57.360
And we are not very good at communication.

379
0:20:57.360 --> 0:20:59.720
Well, I'm bad, but they are good.

380
0:20:59.720 --> 0:21:00.560
Yep.

381
0:21:00.560 --> 0:21:02.200
Yeah, I should say as an academic,

382
0:21:02.200 --> 0:21:05.000
I feel, well, as an academic and a developer,

383
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:08.640
I feel like there is a tendency for academic labs

384
0:21:08.640 --> 0:21:12.120
to have sort of a rotation of conferences that they present at.

385
0:21:12.120 --> 0:21:16.560
And it typically is difficult to get added to that

386
0:21:16.560 --> 0:21:18.800
as a new conference,

387
0:21:18.800 --> 0:21:21.200
and especially if it's something that's sort of

388
0:21:21.200 --> 0:21:22.800
outside of the norm.

389
0:21:22.800 --> 0:21:24.640
And so it's something that I do think,

390
0:21:26.240 --> 0:21:28.320
I think most of the time that's not sort of intentional.

391
0:21:28.320 --> 0:21:30.160
It's just there's so much else going on,

392
0:21:30.160 --> 0:21:31.960
people don't really think about it.

393
0:21:31.960 --> 0:21:34.360
So I would second the suggestion of talking

394
0:21:34.360 --> 0:21:35.800
to PhD student associations

395
0:21:35.800 --> 0:21:39.040
if you're reaching out to universities,

396
0:21:39.040 --> 0:21:43.440
especially universities that might have also to say,

397
0:21:43.440 --> 0:21:46.760
hey, this is an opportunity for interdisciplinary work.

398
0:21:46.760 --> 0:21:51.760
I'm going to do to talk to people who are more technical,

399
0:21:51.760 --> 0:21:53.600
if you're less technical,

400
0:21:53.600 --> 0:21:56.960
or people who are more in open disciplines,

401
0:21:56.960 --> 0:22:01.960
because that sort of stuff is in vogue right now as well.

402
0:22:02.160 --> 0:22:04.560
Interdisciplinary is very important right now.

403
0:22:05.680 --> 0:22:07.120
Collaboration is very important right now.

404
0:22:07.120 --> 0:22:10.520
So I think that once you're on the radar,

405
0:22:10.520 --> 0:22:11.960
it's going to be easier to get people,

406
0:22:11.960 --> 0:22:13.960
it's just getting on the radar.

407
0:22:13.960 --> 0:22:16.400
So the comment was that actually,

408
0:22:16.400 --> 0:22:19.000
it's not easy for labs members

409
0:22:19.000 --> 0:22:22.160
to actually add one more communication conference

410
0:22:22.160 --> 0:22:25.360
in the list of an already existing kind of standard

411
0:22:26.280 --> 0:22:27.440
publication venue.

412
0:22:28.680 --> 0:22:32.160
And above all, when this venue like here

413
0:22:32.160 --> 0:22:34.680
is really not standard, I can't really speaking.

414
0:22:36.440 --> 0:22:41.440
But actually, the interdisciplinary of this room

415
0:22:42.200 --> 0:22:47.280
will be actually a good way to attract notably PhD students

416
0:22:47.280 --> 0:22:50.520
and to make it clear for academia

417
0:22:50.520 --> 0:22:51.920
what the space is basically.

418
0:22:55.320 --> 0:22:58.640
I'm really curious about in the room

419
0:22:58.640 --> 0:23:00.680
and whether anybody else in the room,

420
0:23:00.680 --> 0:23:02.600
other than myself and the people that I know,

421
0:23:02.600 --> 0:23:06.640
would identify as like UX designers,

422
0:23:06.640 --> 0:23:09.360
not developers or academics.

423
0:23:09.360 --> 0:23:11.680
Okay, so that's a very good question.

424
0:23:11.680 --> 0:23:14.960
The question is like, who would in this room

425
0:23:14.960 --> 0:23:19.680
define him or herself as a UX designer?

426
0:23:19.680 --> 0:23:20.880
Can you raise your hand?

427
0:23:22.880 --> 0:23:23.840
There's one there.

428
0:23:27.080 --> 0:23:29.320
So not many, not many.

429
0:23:31.480 --> 0:23:36.480
Are you trying to get the open design room?

430
0:23:36.480 --> 0:23:37.320
The room?

431
0:23:39.000 --> 0:23:41.840
We're doing research into how usable research

432
0:23:41.840 --> 0:23:45.160
and design is to pick some sort of software

433
0:23:45.160 --> 0:23:48.360
so we're trying to figure out like usability

434
0:23:48.360 --> 0:23:51.400
and design and design to figure out.

435
0:23:51.400 --> 0:23:52.240
Okay, cool.

436
0:23:52.240 --> 0:23:54.880
Here, we're just going to open it

437
0:23:54.880 --> 0:23:59.880
and using our designer brains to use events.

438
0:23:59.880 --> 0:24:03.240
Okay, so the comment was, are you aware

439
0:24:03.240 --> 0:24:05.360
that actually there is an open design dev room?

440
0:24:05.360 --> 0:24:08.160
And so then says, yes, actually you co-organize it.

441
0:24:09.040 --> 0:24:11.640
And actually this room is here tomorrow morning,

442
0:24:11.640 --> 0:24:14.360
I think, afternoon, sorry.

443
0:24:15.760 --> 0:24:19.320
And my personal comment on this is that

444
0:24:19.320 --> 0:24:21.480
actually in my career and what I've done,

445
0:24:21.480 --> 0:24:25.080
my experience, UX is very common stone

446
0:24:25.080 --> 0:24:30.080
to go beyond the big, big issue of mixing

447
0:24:32.000 --> 0:24:35.440
qualitative and quantitative approach on data

448
0:24:35.440 --> 0:24:38.720
as my talk tried a little bit to explain.

449
0:24:38.720 --> 0:24:40.440
And that yes, we need designers

450
0:24:40.440 --> 0:24:44.520
and we have one here who talked about it

451
0:24:44.520 --> 0:24:47.680
and in our previous lab, that was very important

452
0:24:47.680 --> 0:24:41.440
so good to discover the mini-rat

453
0:24:49.440 --> 0:24:51.760
is a very place where they try to do this mix.

454
0:24:55.840 --> 0:24:56.680
Fair enough.

455
0:24:56.680 --> 0:24:59.960
I think that, no, it's even less than.

456
0:24:59.960 --> 0:25:01.960
Maybe you want to elaborate.

457
0:25:01.960 --> 0:25:04.200
We should try to not overlap.

458
0:25:04.200 --> 0:25:06.080
It's good this year, the years before

459
0:25:06.080 --> 0:25:09.280
and it's annoying, I think we have kind of

460
0:25:09.280 --> 0:25:11.280
the same public or partially.

461
0:25:11.280 --> 0:25:13.200
So if we could, I don't know if we can do that,

462
0:25:13.200 --> 0:25:15.000
we should ask at least there or whatever.

463
0:25:15.000 --> 0:25:17.480
It's better if we can maintain it separate.

464
0:25:17.480 --> 0:25:18.840
Oh yeah, not at the same time.

465
0:25:18.840 --> 0:25:19.680
We can do that.

466
0:25:19.680 --> 0:25:23.160
Actually we could also talk about what we do.

467
0:25:25.120 --> 0:25:28.080
Right, one last comment is Mike,

468
0:25:28.080 --> 0:25:30.880
if you want after the online session,

469
0:25:30.880 --> 0:25:34.600
we can have drinks together in a place which is.

470
0:25:34.600 --> 0:25:36.440
Tavarnier.

471
0:25:36.440 --> 0:25:37.840
Tavarnier, Tavarnier.

472
0:25:37.840 --> 0:25:39.800
It's close to here.

473
0:25:39.800 --> 0:25:42.720
We are going to write that on the board, Tavarnier.

474
0:25:42.720 --> 0:25:44.120
It's close to here.

475
0:25:44.120 --> 0:25:46.800
And I'm going to set up the stream here

476
0:25:46.800 --> 0:25:50.760
so you can stay here and watch it with us if you want.

477
0:25:50.760 --> 0:25:53.920
So it will be only, we are going to stream the video

478
0:25:53.920 --> 0:25:55.120
and the interaction.

479
0:25:55.120 --> 0:25:57.480
If you want to ask questions to the speakers,

480
0:25:57.480 --> 0:25:59.280
you have to go through the chat room

481
0:25:59.280 --> 0:26:00.960
on the first day website, right?

482
0:26:02.800 --> 0:26:03.640
Thank you all.

483
0:26:03.640 --> 0:26:10.160
Applause
