Good morning everyone, welcome to the Destiny Lotionation Dev Room.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:13.000
I'm going to be very quick and then we can off to Remy.

3
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:15.000
So we have one small ask from you.

4
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:21.000
You can find this poll of the chair next to the door and the chair also on the desk.

5
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:25.000
We want a little bit of feedback because we're trying to get a bigger room with more people.

6
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:29.000
And it's still early, but we expect more people to come inside the room today.

7
0:00:29.000 --> 0:00:34.000
So if you're kind enough, just to fill this in, I'll go anonymously on paper or online.

8
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:36.000
And that would be awesome.

9
0:00:36.000 --> 0:01:00.000
We got sit and all of that stuff.
