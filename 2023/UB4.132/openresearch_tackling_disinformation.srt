1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:29.880
So, good morning everyone.

2
0:00:29.880 --> 0:00:33.320
So my name is ArvÃ© and I'm French.

3
0:00:33.320 --> 0:00:35.960
Sorry, my English is not very perfect.

4
0:00:35.960 --> 0:00:37.960
It's not my mother tongue.

5
0:00:37.960 --> 0:00:43.320
But I work for an NGO called Open Factor, which is a French NGO.

6
0:00:43.320 --> 0:00:46.640
I'm going to talk about it right now.

7
0:00:46.640 --> 0:00:54.200
So self-funded NGO based in France and we created it in 2019.

8
0:00:54.200 --> 0:00:59.920
Our initial goal was to try to federate the francophone-osint open source intelligence

9
0:00:59.920 --> 0:01:07.240
scene as we noticed that the anglophone one was pretty active and brilliant with Bellincat,

10
0:01:07.240 --> 0:01:09.160
for example, people like that.

11
0:01:09.160 --> 0:01:16.720
So we decided to create this NGO and we wanted to assist the newsrooms and activists on ozint

12
0:01:16.720 --> 0:01:19.160
even investigation.

13
0:01:19.160 --> 0:01:25.040
We also wanted to train journalists about what we knew about and also wanted to promote

14
0:01:25.040 --> 0:01:33.600
young journalists based in France in order to help them to get some skills on ozint,

15
0:01:33.600 --> 0:01:40.360
which is a kind of pragmatical way to find a job in France right now.

16
0:01:40.360 --> 0:01:47.640
And as we are an NGO, a self-funded NGO, we also wanted to set up some philanthropic projects

17
0:01:47.640 --> 0:01:55.920
and we trained investigative journalists from Syria, which are relocated in Europe.

18
0:01:55.920 --> 0:02:00.640
We also did some programs in West Africa, all the francophone area.

19
0:02:00.640 --> 0:02:06.160
The NGO today is about 260 members and it's still counting.

20
0:02:06.160 --> 0:02:15.120
And about me, some of the work first, we participated to some of pretty cool investigations such

21
0:02:15.120 --> 0:02:17.920
as Green Blood for a media called Forbidden Stories.

22
0:02:17.920 --> 0:02:23.600
We also published some things and worked on things for BBC, for the French television,

23
0:02:23.600 --> 0:02:26.680
on the Wagner Group, for example.

24
0:02:26.680 --> 0:02:35.600
And we also won a prize with the Swiss TV for a documentary on war crimes in Ukraine.

25
0:02:35.600 --> 0:02:40.120
And recently we published two recommendable reports on Infoross.

26
0:02:40.120 --> 0:02:42.720
I don't know if you've ever heard about that.

27
0:02:42.720 --> 0:02:50.320
It's a Russian company backed by the Russian intelligence and we also work on that and

28
0:02:50.320 --> 0:02:55.600
try to dismantle their network of disinformation inside their border.

29
0:02:55.600 --> 0:03:02.040
And about me, I'm not a coder, obviously, as you probably see.

30
0:03:02.040 --> 0:03:04.560
I'm the co-founder of the NGO.

31
0:03:04.560 --> 0:03:09.960
I'm a former judicial investigator and I'm an open source software enthusiast.

32
0:03:09.960 --> 0:03:17.680
And I've been compiling, well, I used to compile Linux kernels since 1999 or something like

33
0:03:17.680 --> 0:03:18.680
that.

34
0:03:18.680 --> 0:03:22.120
So I'm an open source software enthusiast and evangelist.

35
0:03:22.120 --> 0:03:25.760
And not a techie, I'm a techie, but not a coder.

36
0:03:25.760 --> 0:03:28.800
And I consider myself rather like a Swiss army knife.

37
0:03:28.800 --> 0:03:33.720
I'm very lazy and believe me, if you want to solve a problem, hire a lazy guy or lazy

38
0:03:33.720 --> 0:03:34.720
woman.

39
0:03:34.720 --> 0:03:37.720
And I'm very curious.

40
0:03:37.720 --> 0:03:39.200
What about this information?

41
0:03:39.200 --> 0:03:40.960
This topic is about disinformation.

42
0:03:40.960 --> 0:03:48.160
So disinformation is, as you probably know, false information that is deliberately spread

43
0:03:48.160 --> 0:03:51.960
by an actor in order to deceive people.

44
0:03:51.960 --> 0:03:55.520
There is a fantastic researcher called Ben Nemo.

45
0:03:55.520 --> 0:04:03.480
He tried to resume this concept using the 4D's acronym.

46
0:04:03.480 --> 0:04:06.520
The first one is dismiss.

47
0:04:06.520 --> 0:04:08.640
The other one is distract.

48
0:04:08.640 --> 0:04:13.440
Distort the truth and also dismay.

49
0:04:13.440 --> 0:04:17.720
So that's a very good way to define disinformation.

50
0:04:17.720 --> 0:04:21.160
It's an art for several actors, several threat actors.

51
0:04:21.160 --> 0:04:29.280
You can compare CTI, for example, CTI, sorry, and disinformation.

52
0:04:29.280 --> 0:04:32.440
There are some overlap between these actors.

53
0:04:32.440 --> 0:04:34.040
And there is a very great investigation.

54
0:04:34.040 --> 0:04:39.960
All the links are on the presentation, but there is a really cool investigation called

55
0:04:39.960 --> 0:04:43.560
Doppelganger by the EU Dizinfo Lab.

56
0:04:43.560 --> 0:04:53.040
And I strongly recommend this report about media clones serving the Russian propaganda.

57
0:04:53.040 --> 0:04:56.400
I'm going to switch from time to time in the presentation.

58
0:04:56.400 --> 0:05:01.400
This information is about war, but also health, politics, economy.

59
0:05:01.400 --> 0:05:05.440
It covers mostly every topic, actually.

60
0:05:05.440 --> 0:05:16.520
And of course, internet and the web are probably the greatest echo chamber that they use.

61
0:05:16.520 --> 0:05:19.760
In France, we have such a problem.

62
0:05:19.760 --> 0:05:22.920
And we have a problem with QAnon.

63
0:05:22.920 --> 0:05:25.720
And there is a website called Cactus in France.

64
0:05:25.720 --> 0:05:26.960
It's called Cactus.

65
0:05:26.960 --> 0:05:35.080
It's a judgment for QAQ2 for news and Cactus the tree.

66
0:05:35.080 --> 0:05:40.360
So QAnon is an American political conspiracy, sorry, and political movement.

67
0:05:40.360 --> 0:05:42.960
I'm pretty sure you heard about it.

68
0:05:42.960 --> 0:05:45.400
And it's mostly far right based.

69
0:05:45.400 --> 0:05:50.600
And it appeared on the net in 2017.

70
0:05:50.600 --> 0:05:55.840
This website, this French website is, of course, Conspiracist.

71
0:05:55.840 --> 0:05:57.920
It's all about anti-vaxx.

72
0:05:57.920 --> 0:06:01.120
And it's also very anti-Semitic.

73
0:06:01.120 --> 0:06:02.840
So it's a problem.

74
0:06:02.840 --> 0:06:09.000
It's present on several platforms, such as, of course, the web, but also Telegram, Twitter,

75
0:06:09.000 --> 0:06:13.640
Gabor, GAB, et cetera, all the network.

76
0:06:13.640 --> 0:06:15.840
It has some kind of translated content.

77
0:06:15.840 --> 0:06:19.680
So as soon as you arrive on a web page, it depends on the language, but you can get the

78
0:06:19.680 --> 0:06:23.160
news automatically in French or in English.

79
0:06:23.160 --> 0:06:25.720
This is via Tor, the Tor browser.

80
0:06:25.720 --> 0:06:27.800
So it's basically in English.

81
0:06:27.800 --> 0:06:30.680
But you can also save it in French, for example.

82
0:06:30.680 --> 0:06:34.120
And most of the readers are French or Francophone.

83
0:06:34.120 --> 0:06:37.840
It publishes five or seven articles a day, mostly crap.

84
0:06:37.840 --> 0:06:42.440
It's always crap.

85
0:06:42.440 --> 0:06:46.280
It has more than two million visitors per month.

86
0:06:46.280 --> 0:06:48.440
So it's not nothing.

87
0:06:48.440 --> 0:06:50.120
It's a lot of people.

88
0:06:50.120 --> 0:06:52.720
I have a personal blog and I have an open factor blog.

89
0:06:52.720 --> 0:06:54.600
And we don't have two million visitors a month.

90
0:06:54.600 --> 0:06:56.720
I can assure you.

91
0:06:56.720 --> 0:07:01.640
And since it was open, it revendicates more than 80 million visitors.

92
0:07:01.640 --> 0:07:04.160
So yeah, it's kind of big things.

93
0:07:04.160 --> 0:07:07.600
It's one of the most productive Q&A websites.

94
0:07:07.600 --> 0:07:11.800
So in order to make the investigation, we needed a methodology on disinformation.

95
0:07:11.800 --> 0:07:17.320
And there is a very good framework called the ABCDE, very easy to remember.

96
0:07:17.320 --> 0:07:18.320
It's a good start.

97
0:07:18.320 --> 0:07:20.440
So A stands for actor.

98
0:07:20.440 --> 0:07:23.560
So who is doing the disinformation campaign?

99
0:07:23.560 --> 0:07:28.200
The behavior, how, the content, what about the content, of course.

100
0:07:28.200 --> 0:07:32.640
The degree, it means the scale of the disinformation campaign.

101
0:07:32.640 --> 0:07:34.920
And the last one, he, the he was added later.

102
0:07:34.920 --> 0:07:43.320
But he means the effect that is looking by the actor.

103
0:07:43.320 --> 0:07:50.120
So if we based our research at open factor for cactus, we would say something like, what

104
0:07:50.120 --> 0:07:51.800
is cactus?

105
0:07:51.800 --> 0:07:53.440
What's its audience?

106
0:07:53.440 --> 0:07:58.560
Its environment, ecosystem, its influence, its motivation above all.

107
0:07:58.560 --> 0:08:04.080
And last but not least, if we can identify who is behind cactus, it's really cool for

108
0:08:04.080 --> 0:08:06.560
us as journalists.

109
0:08:06.560 --> 0:08:12.720
So we decided to approach this by trying to qualify the environment.

110
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:20.080
And in order to do that, we used three different tools that I mentioned as a sweet combo.

111
0:08:20.080 --> 0:08:25.720
The first one is HIVE, and it's a tool that was made, most of these tools were made by

112
0:08:25.720 --> 0:08:28.640
the Media Lab Sciences Po.

113
0:08:28.640 --> 0:08:31.400
And HIVE is one of the greatest one.

114
0:08:31.400 --> 0:08:35.040
It's a tool that you can download on your computer.

115
0:08:35.040 --> 0:08:40.120
And it mostly scrapes the web starting from a URL.

116
0:08:40.120 --> 0:08:45.320
And you can build a web corpus of all the websites that are connected to this website

117
0:08:45.320 --> 0:08:47.240
by the links inside the article.

118
0:08:47.240 --> 0:08:56.400
So it was very cool to use with cactus because the most important activity of cactus is

119
0:08:56.400 --> 0:09:01.200
writing articles, as I mentioned, but inside they put links to other articles, sometimes

120
0:09:01.200 --> 0:09:06.760
legit, sometimes links that leads you to other conspiracist websites.

121
0:09:06.760 --> 0:09:13.400
So kind of a long process because right now at the moment of the investigation, cactus

122
0:09:13.400 --> 0:09:18.720
had about 8,000 something articles on the website.

123
0:09:18.720 --> 0:09:21.600
So it took me a long time to scrape everything.

124
0:09:21.600 --> 0:09:28.160
And I had to go to the level two in order to scrape the link from the website that were

125
0:09:28.160 --> 0:09:32.160
cited by Kirk too, if I'm clear about it.

126
0:09:32.160 --> 0:09:35.920
So I had to go at a level of two.

127
0:09:35.920 --> 0:09:38.120
It works pretty well with a caveat.

128
0:09:38.120 --> 0:09:44.680
There are some limitations with Hive, especially one that really bothers us.

129
0:09:44.680 --> 0:09:50.240
It's Cloudflare, sorry for the typo, because as soon as you arrive on a Cloudflare website

130
0:09:50.240 --> 0:09:55.280
and a lot of websites are protected by Cloudflare, you cannot scrape it.

131
0:09:55.280 --> 0:09:58.080
You cannot scrape them with Hive.

132
0:09:58.080 --> 0:10:00.400
But it works pretty well.

133
0:10:00.400 --> 0:10:01.840
Actually, not on my computer.

134
0:10:01.840 --> 0:10:07.640
I tried at the hotel yesterday night and it doesn't work, but believe me, it works.

135
0:10:07.640 --> 0:10:08.760
So I scraped the links.

136
0:10:08.760 --> 0:10:11.320
I'm going to show you the result after that.

137
0:10:11.320 --> 0:10:15.040
The first tool that I combined with Hive was, of course, Jefy.

138
0:10:15.040 --> 0:10:20.440
I've been an enthusiast of Jefy since probably 2011 or something like that.

139
0:10:20.440 --> 0:10:24.800
And it's a very interesting tool to explore and analyze graphs.

140
0:10:24.800 --> 0:10:30.720
And especially if you try to use the modularity algorithm to determine sub-communities.

141
0:10:30.720 --> 0:10:34.840
And it's a brilliant tool that I'm sure you already know about.

142
0:10:34.840 --> 0:10:37.460
And the last one was important for us as journalists.

143
0:10:37.460 --> 0:10:44.320
We tried to illustrate our articles with images and graphs, et cetera.

144
0:10:44.320 --> 0:10:46.660
And it's very difficult to render graphs on websites.

145
0:10:46.660 --> 0:10:52.320
So this tool is brand new and one of its authors is in this room, actually, and I'm super happy

146
0:10:52.320 --> 0:10:54.680
to know that.

147
0:10:54.680 --> 0:10:56.240
And it's Retina.

148
0:10:56.240 --> 0:11:06.240
And Retina offers you the opportunity to import a graph inside your website and to dive into

149
0:11:06.240 --> 0:11:10.960
it and to analyze it or at least to help the people try to understand it.

150
0:11:10.960 --> 0:11:12.180
And that's really cool.

151
0:11:12.180 --> 0:11:13.880
So that's what we got.

152
0:11:13.880 --> 0:11:18.600
And I'm going to show you the rendering of the article.

153
0:11:18.600 --> 0:11:20.920
So this is Hive.

154
0:11:20.920 --> 0:11:25.680
And based on the three tools, what I tried to do is to illustrate the environment of

155
0:11:25.680 --> 0:11:26.680
the website.

156
0:11:26.680 --> 0:11:29.080
So the first one at the top level is Cactus.

157
0:11:29.080 --> 0:11:34.120
And all these websites were at least once mentioned in the articles.

158
0:11:34.120 --> 0:11:41.760
And then all the websites also cite the other one.

159
0:11:41.760 --> 0:11:48.160
And here, for example, you can reach the American disinformation network.

160
0:11:48.160 --> 0:11:53.300
You've got the Francophone one here and the Canadian one here.

161
0:11:53.300 --> 0:11:58.240
So it's very interesting to see where Cactus is in the middle of everything.

162
0:11:58.240 --> 0:12:01.560
So I try to illustrate the graph like this.

163
0:12:01.560 --> 0:12:08.800
So it gives you with this three tools a very good idea of the environment of the website.

164
0:12:08.800 --> 0:12:14.960
What you can see inside also are some legitimate websites such as MediaPart, for example, or

165
0:12:14.960 --> 0:12:16.360
YouTube, et cetera, et cetera.

166
0:12:16.360 --> 0:12:22.560
And that's one of their techniques in order to drain some, to lead some activity on the

167
0:12:22.560 --> 0:12:28.880
website, they link regular website and also conspiracies website.

168
0:12:28.880 --> 0:12:34.840
It's in order to increase their SEO, their ranking on Google, for example.

169
0:12:34.840 --> 0:12:39.560
So it's very important to put legitimate and disinformation website.

170
0:12:39.560 --> 0:12:46.600
So that was the first part of the investigation purely made with open source software.

171
0:12:46.600 --> 0:12:48.360
The second one was the influence.

172
0:12:48.360 --> 0:12:51.000
And it's rather usual to do that.

173
0:12:51.000 --> 0:12:54.240
So we needed a good scraper for Twitter.

174
0:12:54.240 --> 0:13:02.760
Our idea was to have an idea on how the disinformation could escape from their traditional networks

175
0:13:02.760 --> 0:13:10.240
such as Gabe or Paner, for example, and to escape from this platform to go to mainstream

176
0:13:10.240 --> 0:13:11.240
platforms.

177
0:13:11.240 --> 0:13:17.000
So Twitter is a really good, used to be a very good platform to analyze.

178
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:18.520
I don't know what's going on.

179
0:13:18.520 --> 0:13:23.160
I don't know what it's going to be within a few days, but essence scrape is a cool tool

180
0:13:23.160 --> 0:13:24.160
to do that.

181
0:13:24.160 --> 0:13:25.400
I don't know if you heard about it.

182
0:13:25.400 --> 0:13:29.020
It's a scraper for Twitter.

183
0:13:29.020 --> 0:13:36.080
So what we did basically was to extract all the tweets from its creation that had a link

184
0:13:36.080 --> 0:13:40.040
referring to cactus.fr, which was the website.

185
0:13:40.040 --> 0:13:42.680
And we wanted to know about its activity.

186
0:13:42.680 --> 0:13:47.880
So you just basically open a terminal and you copy paste this.

187
0:13:47.880 --> 0:13:54.200
I'm not going to export to it first, but what you receive, I hope my connection is okay.

188
0:13:54.200 --> 0:13:55.200
Yes.

189
0:13:55.200 --> 0:13:57.840
So you get all the tweets.

190
0:13:57.840 --> 0:13:59.160
You can grab a cafe.

191
0:13:59.160 --> 0:14:01.440
You don't have to scroll.

192
0:14:01.440 --> 0:14:03.780
And when you come back, you get all the tweets.

193
0:14:03.780 --> 0:14:08.560
So there are approximately 124,000 tweets that talk about it.

194
0:14:08.560 --> 0:14:10.500
Once again, it's not nothing.

195
0:14:10.500 --> 0:14:15.320
And you can export that as a JSON file.

196
0:14:15.320 --> 0:14:18.040
Here.

197
0:14:18.040 --> 0:14:19.040
So it's going to work.

198
0:14:19.040 --> 0:14:21.240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

199
0:14:21.240 --> 0:14:24.360
I'm going to break it right now.

200
0:14:24.360 --> 0:14:28.840
Once you have these tweets, you have to scrape them and you have to wrangle your data.

201
0:14:28.840 --> 0:14:31.640
And I used another tool called OpenRefine.

202
0:14:31.640 --> 0:14:34.800
You probably know about OpenRefine.

203
0:14:34.800 --> 0:14:37.620
It's a powerful tool to cleanse.

204
0:14:37.620 --> 0:14:45.320
And there is a wow effect for journalists, especially with this tool that I like.

205
0:14:45.320 --> 0:14:48.960
It's how it deals with JSON file.

206
0:14:48.960 --> 0:14:53.360
So this is going to be maybe possible.

207
0:14:53.360 --> 0:15:02.280
So you open the text like this and it knows how to render JSON file in CSV, which is a

208
0:15:02.280 --> 0:15:06.420
format that we all like when we do data journalism.

209
0:15:06.420 --> 0:15:10.940
So you can now analyze all the data that you have.

210
0:15:10.940 --> 0:15:16.520
So that's why I love OpenRefine and also when you want to do some clustering.

211
0:15:16.520 --> 0:15:18.720
And the last one was, of course, R Anti-Diverse.

212
0:15:18.720 --> 0:15:21.320
I'm not going to dive into R Anti-Diverse.

213
0:15:21.320 --> 0:15:24.240
You have had several presentations on that.

214
0:15:24.240 --> 0:15:30.760
But these tools are really easy because R is an easy language for statistics, easy syntax,

215
0:15:30.760 --> 0:15:34.620
very readable when you don't know how to code.

216
0:15:34.620 --> 0:15:37.040
And this is really important for newsroom, for example.

217
0:15:37.040 --> 0:15:39.320
Most of the time, few journalists know how to code.

218
0:15:39.320 --> 0:15:42.720
So having a code that is readable is important.

219
0:15:42.720 --> 0:15:44.220
You get a quick overview.

220
0:15:44.220 --> 0:15:45.400
So we've got 10 minutes, yes.

221
0:15:45.400 --> 0:15:46.400
Thank you.

222
0:15:46.400 --> 0:15:51.920
It's very convenient for prototyping and important also for reproducibility.

223
0:15:51.920 --> 0:15:53.440
But if you want, you can use Python.

224
0:15:53.440 --> 0:15:56.920
I don't want to enter the war between R and Python.

225
0:15:56.920 --> 0:15:57.920
The motivation.

226
0:15:57.920 --> 0:16:01.240
The motivation, we use Firefox and we dive into the source code.

227
0:16:01.240 --> 0:16:08.880
And this one was pretty easy because Cura2 has a Google ad program inside.

228
0:16:08.880 --> 0:16:12.320
So every click that you made on this web page gives you some money.

229
0:16:12.320 --> 0:16:16.400
So this is the main motivation apart from the ideology.

230
0:16:16.400 --> 0:16:26.120
And about the identity, all the tools that we got from GitHub, Hollehey, Gint, and Sherlock.

231
0:16:26.120 --> 0:16:32.280
These are command line tools that are packaged right now by a French company called APOs.

232
0:16:32.280 --> 0:16:36.980
But you can use them on your terminal and it will help you to dive into the nicknames

233
0:16:36.980 --> 0:16:40.360
and the mail combination on websites.

234
0:16:40.360 --> 0:16:45.900
We also use some leaks, but we found out who was Patrick behind this website.

235
0:16:45.900 --> 0:16:48.300
So let's wrap this up.

236
0:16:48.300 --> 0:16:54.880
First of all, I want to talk about the myth of a single tool in Hoseint.

237
0:16:54.880 --> 0:17:00.280
Most of the time when I say to people, well, I'm a journalist and I work on Hoseint, they

238
0:17:00.280 --> 0:17:01.760
say, oh, which tool do you use?

239
0:17:01.760 --> 0:17:03.280
There are several tools.

240
0:17:03.280 --> 0:17:07.460
There is no single tool in Hoseint and you've got to mix everything.

241
0:17:07.460 --> 0:17:13.800
About this investigation, this guy Patrick is a retired IT technician in a lost town

242
0:17:13.800 --> 0:17:16.680
in the middle of France.

243
0:17:16.680 --> 0:17:23.280
He's a completist, but as we saw, he's in the middle of a bubble of completist influence.

244
0:17:23.280 --> 0:17:29.080
He earns approximately $4,000 a month just by writing crap.

245
0:17:29.080 --> 0:17:36.080
So it's very important for us and for the audience to know him and to help him on the

246
0:17:36.080 --> 0:17:37.080
website.

247
0:17:37.080 --> 0:17:39.440
Patrick, we know who you are.

248
0:17:39.440 --> 0:17:41.680
That's my thing.

249
0:17:41.680 --> 0:17:43.480
Why do we use OpenSoup software?

250
0:17:43.480 --> 0:17:45.520
Because they are powerful, adaptable.

251
0:17:45.520 --> 0:17:49.640
They respect your privacy and reproducibility.

252
0:17:49.640 --> 0:17:53.260
I don't ever know how to pronounce this word.

253
0:17:53.260 --> 0:17:57.640
Most of the time, these tools are free, which is really important and I insist on that.

254
0:17:57.640 --> 0:18:01.240
For journalists, we don't have money.

255
0:18:01.240 --> 0:18:05.440
When you go to Africa and train NGOs, for example, or journalists, it's very complicated

256
0:18:05.440 --> 0:18:06.800
to buy software for them.

257
0:18:06.800 --> 0:18:09.880
They don't even have regular machines.

258
0:18:09.880 --> 0:18:12.440
Having OpenSoup software is really important.

259
0:18:12.440 --> 0:18:13.440
Thank you, you all.

260
0:18:13.440 --> 0:18:19.000
If you code for OpenSoup software, it's really important for civil society.

261
0:18:19.000 --> 0:18:21.560
Thank you.

262
0:18:21.560 --> 0:18:23.680
The last one, collaboration.

263
0:18:23.680 --> 0:18:25.120
I didn't talk about collaboration.

264
0:18:25.120 --> 0:18:31.840
You're in the room today and it's important for us to mention that collaboration on how

265
0:18:31.840 --> 0:18:36.880
our investigation is the key, first of all by software, but also in order to share information

266
0:18:36.880 --> 0:18:40.880
and to share indicators of confirmation, for example.

267
0:18:40.880 --> 0:18:42.800
So data capitalization is important.

268
0:18:42.800 --> 0:18:48.480
There is this project called OpenCTI that I hope we will try to impose in Europe as a

269
0:18:48.480 --> 0:18:49.480
tool.

270
0:18:49.480 --> 0:18:54.920
It's an open source tool and we'll try to impose it as a standard with the DISARM matrix.

271
0:18:54.920 --> 0:18:55.920
It's called DISARM.

272
0:18:55.920 --> 0:18:59.480
All the links are in the presentation in order to get some cooperation.

273
0:18:59.480 --> 0:19:00.480
Thank you very much.

274
0:19:00.480 --> 0:19:01.480
Thank you.

275
0:19:01.480 --> 0:19:09.480
Let's spare a thought for Patrick and on with the questions.

276
0:19:09.480 --> 0:19:20.480
Yes.

277
0:19:20.480 --> 0:19:31.480
You mentioned you used some leaks.

278
0:19:31.480 --> 0:19:36.480
Is that a leaks that you have friends that gave you information or is it that you found

279
0:19:36.480 --> 0:19:37.480
things that had been put inadvertently in the public sphere?

280
0:19:37.480 --> 0:19:38.480
Second one, which we try to do when we do some...

281
0:19:38.480 --> 0:19:43.480
We try to do some leaks and the question was, is this information that some friends give

282
0:19:43.480 --> 0:19:47.520
me or information that is publicly available on the internet?

283
0:19:47.520 --> 0:19:48.880
That was the question.

284
0:19:48.880 --> 0:19:56.600
So the answer is as OpenFactory is an NGO, we don't have friends.

285
0:19:56.600 --> 0:19:59.360
So we use public leaks.

286
0:19:59.360 --> 0:20:05.480
We dive on Telegram, the Darknet, et cetera, and we use basically keywords, passwords and

287
0:20:05.480 --> 0:20:11.640
emails in order to make connection between nicknames and try to identify people like

288
0:20:11.640 --> 0:20:12.640
this.

289
0:20:12.640 --> 0:20:15.400
That's what we do.

290
0:20:15.400 --> 0:20:17.840
We also have a sort of...

291
0:20:17.840 --> 0:20:25.320
I'm a former investigative journalist, an investigator, so what I try to do is sort of judicial methodology.

292
0:20:25.320 --> 0:20:30.880
So we try to open everything in our investigation and we mention all the information that we

293
0:20:30.880 --> 0:20:31.880
get.

294
0:20:31.880 --> 0:20:36.280
So if we link from somewhere on the internet, we will explain where we got the leak every

295
0:20:36.280 --> 0:20:37.800
time.

296
0:20:37.800 --> 0:20:39.400
Transparency is important.

297
0:20:39.400 --> 0:20:40.400
Another question here?

298
0:20:40.400 --> 0:20:41.400
I have a question.

299
0:20:41.400 --> 0:20:42.400
Are you Jewish?

300
0:20:42.400 --> 0:20:43.400
No, I'm not.

301
0:20:43.400 --> 0:20:44.400
Okay.

302
0:20:44.400 --> 0:20:45.400
The question was, I'm a Jewish.

303
0:20:45.400 --> 0:20:46.400
No, I'm not.

304
0:20:46.400 --> 0:20:47.400
I'm not Jewish.

305
0:20:47.400 --> 0:20:48.400
Other question?

306
0:20:48.400 --> 0:20:49.400
Yes.

307
0:20:49.400 --> 0:20:53.400
I mean, you mentioned like one particular question.

308
0:20:53.400 --> 0:21:03.760
That you identified, but I mean, I guess there are more people.

309
0:21:03.760 --> 0:21:13.400
What is the scope of the success of this program?

310
0:21:13.400 --> 0:21:17.880
The question is that we identify one person behind this website and there are probably

311
0:21:17.880 --> 0:21:20.240
more people and more websites like this.

312
0:21:20.240 --> 0:21:24.800
So we are just a bunch of cool people working behind their computer.

313
0:21:24.800 --> 0:21:29.400
So we try to do our best, but at least we have one website which is really influenced.

314
0:21:29.400 --> 0:21:35.200
So we start by the most productive website that we want to investigate, but of course

315
0:21:35.200 --> 0:21:40.720
there are millions, not millions, but thousands and thousands of people doing these kind of

316
0:21:40.720 --> 0:21:41.720
things.

317
0:21:41.720 --> 0:21:45.680
We do what we can and we're trying to inspire other journalists in order to make their own

318
0:21:45.680 --> 0:21:50.680
investigation and to help these kind of people.

319
0:21:50.680 --> 0:21:51.680
Sorry.

320
0:21:51.680 --> 0:21:57.680
How big is the environment of NGO working on this kind of subject?

321
0:21:57.680 --> 0:21:59.680
Are you the only one?

322
0:21:59.680 --> 0:22:04.560
Are you a lot of NGOs and friends working on this information?

323
0:22:04.560 --> 0:22:08.760
The question is, are we a lot of people, for example, in France working on this information?

324
0:22:08.760 --> 0:22:14.320
There are some newspaper and newsroom that start to investigate on these kind of topics.

325
0:22:14.320 --> 0:22:19.040
It's not very popular, not very famous, but I think that the last three or four years,

326
0:22:19.040 --> 0:22:23.720
this information has become a major issue, especially in Europe.

327
0:22:23.720 --> 0:22:27.920
And we see plenty of NGOs such as EU, this info lab, for example.

328
0:22:27.920 --> 0:22:33.280
They are friends of ours and we really like them and we try to collaborate with them.

329
0:22:33.280 --> 0:22:39.560
So yeah, I hope that we'll get more and more people in order to work on that.

330
0:22:39.560 --> 0:22:40.560
Other question?

331
0:22:40.560 --> 0:22:44.560
How can you stop automatic disinformation?

332
0:22:44.560 --> 0:22:48.160
So I'm thinking about chat GPT and bots and stuff like that.

333
0:22:48.160 --> 0:22:53.040
So can you distinguish whether it's being auto-generated or human-generated?

334
0:22:53.040 --> 0:23:01.320
So the question is that, how can we stop automatic disinformation made, for example, by chat GPT?

335
0:23:01.320 --> 0:23:08.920
Chat GPT is going to be a very big issue for influence, which is something pretty obvious.

336
0:23:08.920 --> 0:23:11.560
When I'm saying that, I'm saying obvious thing.

337
0:23:11.560 --> 0:23:17.160
But yeah, it's going to be a problem because websites, especially search engines, they

338
0:23:17.160 --> 0:23:22.600
use, as I mentioned, SEO technique in order to do the ranking of the website.

339
0:23:22.600 --> 0:23:30.520
And one of the biggest issues, for example, for Google will be to figure out if a content

340
0:23:30.520 --> 0:23:37.040
not only is duplicated, which was pretty easy to do, but now automatically connected.

341
0:23:37.040 --> 0:23:39.120
So I don't have any solution for the moment.

342
0:23:39.120 --> 0:23:41.280
We haven't faced this problem so far.

343
0:23:41.280 --> 0:23:48.080
Chat GPT is quite recent, and its use is not widespread right now, but it's going to change

344
0:23:48.080 --> 0:23:50.320
within the next six months.

345
0:23:50.320 --> 0:23:51.720
And I'm sure about that.

346
0:23:51.720 --> 0:23:57.760
As an answer to this gentleman's question, the OpenAIG recently launched a site where

347
0:23:57.760 --> 0:23:59.760
you can give an effect.

348
0:23:59.760 --> 0:24:04.760
It will give you a confidence level if it's human-generated or computer-generated.

349
0:24:04.760 --> 0:24:05.760
Yeah.

350
0:24:05.760 --> 0:24:11.000
Could you please give a red-noth visualization again?

351
0:24:11.000 --> 0:24:12.000
Sorry, sorry.

352
0:24:12.000 --> 0:24:14.000
The height of the page?

353
0:24:14.000 --> 0:24:15.000
Yep.

354
0:24:15.000 --> 0:24:16.000
Sorry.

355
0:24:16.000 --> 0:24:17.000
This one.

356
0:24:17.000 --> 0:24:20.000
Yeah, I was curious about the labeling you did of the notes.

357
0:24:20.000 --> 0:24:22.040
Could you explain more about the color classification?

358
0:24:22.040 --> 0:24:23.040
The label?

359
0:24:23.040 --> 0:24:24.040
Yes.

360
0:24:24.040 --> 0:24:26.160
So the label is basically the title of the website?

361
0:24:26.160 --> 0:24:28.160
Yeah, sorry, the coloring.

362
0:24:28.160 --> 0:24:29.360
Ah, the coloring.

363
0:24:29.360 --> 0:24:35.360
We used the betweenness centrality on this graph.

364
0:24:35.360 --> 0:24:36.360
Okay.

365
0:24:36.360 --> 0:24:44.320
So it's usually what I do on this kind of website in order to figure out the importance

366
0:24:44.320 --> 0:24:51.640
of a node as a distributor of the connections between other sub-communities.

367
0:24:51.640 --> 0:24:52.640
So yeah.

368
0:24:52.640 --> 0:24:58.360
Because American clusters, I'm just curious about your clustering.

369
0:24:58.360 --> 0:24:59.360
Ah, okay.

370
0:24:59.360 --> 0:25:06.360
The distribution, you mean, for example, all the links, it's basically the standard,

371
0:25:06.360 --> 0:25:07.360
Gephi...

372
0:25:07.360 --> 0:25:08.360
No?

373
0:25:08.360 --> 0:25:09.360
No, no, no.

374
0:25:09.360 --> 0:25:10.360
The specialization?

375
0:25:10.360 --> 0:25:11.360
What?

376
0:25:11.360 --> 0:25:12.360
For SATLAS too.

377
0:25:12.360 --> 0:25:13.360
For SATLAS too.

378
0:25:13.360 --> 0:25:14.360
For SATLAS.

379
0:25:14.360 --> 0:25:16.360
So it's this one?

380
0:25:16.360 --> 0:25:17.360
Yeah, this one.

381
0:25:17.360 --> 0:25:18.360
So it's for SATLAS.

382
0:25:18.360 --> 0:25:28.360
So every link that is close to the other one will be packed as itself and a group, a group

383
0:25:28.360 --> 0:25:34.360
cluster that is not very linked to another one will be far away from the other one.

384
0:25:34.360 --> 0:25:50.260
There is a bias in the representation because I wanted Q-A

385
0:25:50.260 --> 0:26:06.880
to be clear.

386
0:26:06.880 --> 0:26:14.480
First of all, when you work on this information, so the question is how can we make the distinction

387
0:26:14.480 --> 0:26:16.800
between misinformation and disinformation?

388
0:26:16.800 --> 0:26:20.920
So basically when you start an investigation, this is the first question that you ask yourself.

389
0:26:20.920 --> 0:26:23.920
Is it going to be disinformation or misinformation?

390
0:26:23.920 --> 0:26:31.480
Misinformation is like something that could be true, but no, that is false, but the person

391
0:26:31.480 --> 0:26:33.240
thinks it's true.

392
0:26:33.240 --> 0:26:34.240
Okay?

393
0:26:34.240 --> 0:26:38.800
But when you see the content of the website, you know that he's talking always on the same

394
0:26:38.800 --> 0:26:42.060
topics, always distributing the same kind of information.

395
0:26:42.060 --> 0:26:44.320
So you know that he does this deliberately.

396
0:26:44.320 --> 0:26:49.200
The motivation is important and that's why in this case it was important to identify

397
0:26:49.200 --> 0:26:55.680
the Google Ads tag because you know for sure that its motivation is probably ideology,

398
0:26:55.680 --> 0:27:02.880
probably, if you see his Facebook wall, for example, but there is the money and the ads

399
0:27:02.880 --> 0:27:08.720
and the Google and the platform are fueling the disinformation with the ad system.

400
0:27:08.720 --> 0:27:10.720
So this is really important to identify.

401
0:27:10.720 --> 0:27:19.240
Okay, last question over there.

402
0:27:19.240 --> 0:27:33.800
I didn't get the question, sorry.

403
0:27:33.800 --> 0:27:39.640
So is there a strategy from, the question is that is there a strategy to tackle disinformation

404
0:27:39.640 --> 0:27:41.960
from authoritarian states?

405
0:27:41.960 --> 0:27:43.920
I think so.

406
0:27:43.920 --> 0:27:47.300
The problem is that everybody, everyone has its own strategy.

407
0:27:47.300 --> 0:27:50.920
So there are millions of strategy and this is the big issue according to me.

408
0:27:50.920 --> 0:27:56.640
So Europe, for example, is trying to organize this by different programs.

409
0:27:56.640 --> 0:28:05.560
EU Dizinfo Lab, like is the leader in trying to federate the Dizinfo structure and activist

410
0:28:05.560 --> 0:28:09.640
in order to make wider and bigger investigation like this.

411
0:28:09.640 --> 0:28:12.320
So I think yes, there is a strategy.

412
0:28:12.320 --> 0:28:17.600
The problem is that for the moment there are multiple strategy, but it's going to change.

413
0:28:17.600 --> 0:28:30.800
Thank you.
