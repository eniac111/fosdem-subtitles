1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.000
We started and we went through a number of stages like a lot of projects do.

2
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:21.000
We started with a small donation. We were trying to build up and get into a system where we could be self-sustaining

3
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:33.000
because we wanted to actually have the ability to move faster. We wanted to build a better project for our community.

4
0:00:33.000 --> 0:00:40.000
And the way we wanted to do that was we wanted to bring full-time developers into the project.

5
0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:46.000
And as of 2022, we've been successful. We have two full-time developers working on the KiCAD project.

6
0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:52.000
We have eight other core developers who are all contributing and hundreds of people around the world

7
0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:57.000
who we are able to successfully fund to help work on the project.

8
0:00:57.000 --> 0:01:04.000
Icon designers, documentations, librarians, all of the people that it takes to make a large open-source project work

9
0:01:04.000 --> 0:01:11.000
is sustained by our donations, by our community.

10
0:01:11.000 --> 0:01:19.000
And I want to tell you a little bit about how this came to be because this wasn't obvious and it wasn't immediate

11
0:01:19.000 --> 0:01:23.000
and it wasn't just putting up a single page.

12
0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:29.000
So initially, our first donation page looked like this. And you can see I've kind of squished it down, right?

13
0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:35.000
So I could see the whole page. But if you looked at it on your web browser, you would see the top little picture.

14
0:01:35.000 --> 0:01:41.000
And you had to go all the way down to get to your donations. Now, quick.

15
0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:49.000
I would like someone in the room to donate 120 Swiss franc to the KiCAD project.

16
0:01:49.000 --> 0:02:00.000
Okay. The question was, for each user who went in there, who didn't happen to use Swiss franc as their base currency,

17
0:02:00.000 --> 0:02:04.000
how much is going to show up on my credit card bill if I decide to support the project?

18
0:02:04.000 --> 0:02:08.000
How do I know that this is going to actually support the project?

19
0:02:08.000 --> 0:02:22.000
All of these initial pain points in our first generation of a donation page were there because we picked what was available,

20
0:02:22.000 --> 0:02:28.000
the projects that were supporting us. We were initially working through the CERN Open Society Foundation.

21
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:32.000
And they provided this, but they worked in Swiss francs because they're CERN.

22
0:02:32.000 --> 0:02:41.000
And our users, maybe not so much. We were initially seeing very few donations from this site.

23
0:02:41.000 --> 0:02:47.000
So I'm going to tell you how we fixed it. Six ways. Or six steps.

24
0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:55.000
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to identify who our users are because this drives every single choice we make in design.

25
0:02:55.000 --> 0:02:58.000
Who is going to be the person who we're talking to.

26
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:07.000
Then, never interrupt the experience that your community has, your donors have,

27
0:03:07.000 --> 0:03:12.000
because the moment that you interrupt their experiences, the moment that they have better things to do.

28
0:03:12.000 --> 0:03:19.000
You always want to respect their time. Then, shorten that click path.

29
0:03:19.000 --> 0:03:28.000
Make sure that you're not setting yourself up for failure by putting intermediate steps that you don't have to have.

30
0:03:28.000 --> 0:03:37.000
Every time that you have to click on another link, you are going to lose more and more of your community before they get to that final point,

31
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:42.000
where they can actually come in to the larger community.

32
0:03:42.000 --> 0:03:52.000
Donations in-house. There are a lot of places that will actually set up donations.

33
0:03:52.000 --> 0:03:58.000
I'm going to tell you, you need to do that yourself. Then test every single step.

34
0:03:58.000 --> 0:04:10.000
And finally, build your community because this is the basic raison d'Ãªtre that we have as open source developers.

35
0:04:10.000 --> 0:04:23.000
We are a community. We are stronger as a community. This should be focused as the primary reason for each element in our donations.

36
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:31.000
First, who is your customer? Who is the user base that you are trying to support?

37
0:04:31.000 --> 0:04:40.000
For KiCad, we were a bunch of engineers. We were a bunch of circuit designers.

38
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:47.000
The professionals who were building those circuits were our audience.

39
0:04:47.000 --> 0:05:04.000
So we needed to set up the system to reflect that. Your designers or your customers are also in this space who you are focusing on.

40
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:09.000
It's not just what you do for a living. It's where you are in the world.

41
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:20.000
What language do you speak natively? What are you most comfortable in? Because once you can make your audience comfort, your community more comfortable,

42
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:27.000
then that is a time in which your community becomes stronger, becomes more tightly bound together.

43
0:05:27.000 --> 0:05:40.000
For us, we need to identify where we are. This is actual data. For KiCad, where do we see people coming into the project?

44
0:05:40.000 --> 0:05:47.000
We gather anonymized data that is sorted by country.

45
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:57.000
The actual map here are top five regions, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and the UK.

46
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:01.000
Notice Switzerland is not in the top five.

47
0:06:01.000 --> 0:06:07.000
We were doing this wrong in the beginning. We were setting up a barrier in the beginning.

48
0:06:07.000 --> 0:06:13.000
We should be donating in Euro. We should be donating in US dollar.

49
0:06:13.000 --> 0:06:22.000
We should be donating in yen, in pound. But Swiss franc is maybe not the currency we should have chosen.

50
0:06:22.000 --> 0:06:27.000
We need to address this. The first step that we do is we try to address this.

51
0:06:27.000 --> 0:06:34.000
We joined in 2019. The Linux Foundation started a crowdfunding project.

52
0:06:34.000 --> 0:06:40.000
This was a way of bringing donations into open source projects.

53
0:06:40.000 --> 0:06:44.000
We joined this at the outset.

54
0:06:44.000 --> 0:06:48.000
Our primary reason, even though the Linux Foundation site is slow,

55
0:06:48.000 --> 0:06:56.000
even though they still have multiple clicks and require way too much data to allow you to donate,

56
0:06:56.000 --> 0:07:03.000
even with all of that, just changing from Swiss franc to US dollar donations,

57
0:07:03.000 --> 0:07:11.000
met more of our community's needs. Our donations increased from about 10 per month to about 30 per month, which is good.

58
0:07:11.000 --> 0:07:18.000
It's a low increase because then we start to bring more people into our community.

59
0:07:18.000 --> 0:07:23.000
But we need to do more. We want to say, all right, what are the pain points still?

60
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:25.000
We're still slow. We still require multiple clicks.

61
0:07:25.000 --> 0:07:30.000
I'm going to say, don't interrupt. Don't interrupt your donor's experience.

62
0:07:30.000 --> 0:07:34.000
I love GitHub sponsors. It's a wonderful program.

63
0:07:34.000 --> 0:07:36.000
If you're doing that, that's great.

64
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:42.000
But you will never grow your community by putting the GitHub sponsors up there,

65
0:07:42.000 --> 0:07:46.000
because the only people who are going to go up to the top of that page and find that button

66
0:07:46.000 --> 0:07:49.000
and click on that button are people who are already looking for it.

67
0:07:49.000 --> 0:07:56.000
Because no one goes to this page unless they want to download your software.

68
0:07:56.000 --> 0:07:58.000
Unless they want to download their software.

69
0:07:58.000 --> 0:08:03.000
And the download is down here. And the sponsor is all the way up there.

70
0:08:03.000 --> 0:08:06.000
And so you have to go out of your way to find this.

71
0:08:06.000 --> 0:08:15.000
So setting up this, for us, we identify, this is the KiCad website,

72
0:08:15.000 --> 0:08:19.000
we identify why do you go to the KiCad website.

73
0:08:19.000 --> 0:08:23.000
You go to the KiCad website to get KiCad, to download KiCad.

74
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:28.000
And so, if we're respecting our community's time,

75
0:08:28.000 --> 0:08:34.000
we don't make them go out of their way to the donate button in the top right hand corner.

76
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:41.000
We start with making sure that they get to do what they came here to do first,

77
0:08:41.000 --> 0:08:43.000
which is download the software.

78
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:49.000
So once you click on the download, instead of just showing a static page,

79
0:08:49.000 --> 0:08:55.000
we start the download, and while they're waiting, we give them the opportunity to donate.

80
0:08:55.000 --> 0:09:01.000
Because this means, this says, you are already accomplishing what you started,

81
0:09:01.000 --> 0:09:07.000
what you wanted to do, and we're going to give you this awesome software.

82
0:09:07.000 --> 0:09:09.000
Your software is awesome too.

83
0:09:09.000 --> 0:09:14.000
So that then becomes an opportunity while you're waiting.

84
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:18.000
Maybe you also want to donate.

85
0:09:18.000 --> 0:09:24.000
And so this right here gave us an enormous increase,

86
0:09:24.000 --> 0:09:29.000
because people were now willing to say, that's a good idea,

87
0:09:29.000 --> 0:09:31.000
because I want this software to be better.

88
0:09:31.000 --> 0:09:33.000
I want to support this thing that I use,

89
0:09:33.000 --> 0:09:36.000
and our donations increase to 80 per month at this point.

90
0:09:36.000 --> 0:09:43.000
Now, part and parcel to this is shortening your click path,

91
0:09:43.000 --> 0:09:48.000
because if you're respecting your community's time,

92
0:09:48.000 --> 0:09:51.000
you don't make them jump through hoops.

93
0:09:51.000 --> 0:09:57.000
Our initial page had 9 to 12 clicks over 4 pages,

94
0:09:57.000 --> 0:10:02.000
and it went through Postmates, and it was a mess.

95
0:10:02.000 --> 0:10:08.000
Our current page, every time we shortened it, we saw more people coming in.

96
0:10:08.000 --> 0:10:12.000
And so we're right now at 1 to 2 clicks over 2 pages.

97
0:10:12.000 --> 0:10:15.000
We'd like to get it even smaller,

98
0:10:15.000 --> 0:10:18.000
but that's where we're at right now,

99
0:10:18.000 --> 0:10:27.000
because we have built this sub-site that we hold on our own.

100
0:10:27.000 --> 0:10:30.000
So you can't shorten the click path

101
0:10:30.000 --> 0:10:36.000
if you don't own your own project's donation page,

102
0:10:36.000 --> 0:10:42.000
because then you're at the mercy of whatever intermediary

103
0:10:42.000 --> 0:10:47.000
is going to be in between your community and you.

104
0:10:47.000 --> 0:10:51.000
So we built this ourselves, and we put it behind a CDN,

105
0:10:51.000 --> 0:10:54.000
a content delivery network, because we want this fast.

106
0:10:54.000 --> 0:10:59.000
We want this to be directly at the user to the extent that we can.

107
0:10:59.000 --> 0:11:05.000
Right now, when you see this, all you need to do is,

108
0:11:05.000 --> 0:11:08.000
if you like the suggested donation, you click.

109
0:11:08.000 --> 0:11:10.000
It's one click.

110
0:11:10.000 --> 0:11:12.000
If you don't like the suggested donation,

111
0:11:12.000 --> 0:11:16.000
you can change it to whatever you want and then click through.

112
0:11:16.000 --> 0:11:18.000
So maybe two if you want to change it.

113
0:11:18.000 --> 0:11:21.000
We go through Stripe.

114
0:11:21.000 --> 0:11:25.000
We go through Stripe for the reason that we can pick

115
0:11:25.000 --> 0:11:28.000
how people are allowed to donate.

116
0:11:28.000 --> 0:11:32.000
So within China, for instance,

117
0:11:32.000 --> 0:11:35.000
where a large number of our users are,

118
0:11:35.000 --> 0:11:39.000
we can link into OlliePay through Stripe.

119
0:11:39.000 --> 0:11:42.000
And this allows our Chinese user base

120
0:11:42.000 --> 0:11:47.000
to integrate into our community better than they would be able to

121
0:11:47.000 --> 0:11:53.000
if we required credit cards, which are not common in China.

122
0:11:53.000 --> 0:12:00.000
Similarly, JiroPay in Europe, we link that in,

123
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:07.000
SEPA payments, all of these things are accessible through Stripe,

124
0:12:07.000 --> 0:12:09.000
which is one of the reasons why we chose it.

125
0:12:09.000 --> 0:12:11.000
But there are other options as well.

126
0:12:11.000 --> 0:12:15.000
And then we also added PayPal.

127
0:12:15.000 --> 0:12:19.000
Now, people have different feelings about PayPal, and that's fine.

128
0:12:19.000 --> 0:12:26.000
But what I'm going to tell you is that if your community uses PayPal,

129
0:12:26.000 --> 0:12:34.000
then you should use PayPal because that is meeting them where they're at right now.

130
0:12:34.000 --> 0:12:37.000
So bring your donations in-house.

131
0:12:37.000 --> 0:12:43.000
Internal are where you are controlling the information.

132
0:12:43.000 --> 0:12:46.000
And external, you need to get the information from someone else.

133
0:12:46.000 --> 0:12:50.000
And I'm going to tell you that internal is where you want to be

134
0:12:50.000 --> 0:12:52.000
because you get to make your own donation page,

135
0:12:52.000 --> 0:12:55.000
you get to make it as fast as you possibly can,

136
0:12:55.000 --> 0:12:59.000
and you get to control the individual steps.

137
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:07.000
Every time that you make your users, make your community wait to donate,

138
0:13:07.000 --> 0:13:12.000
every time you increase that load time by 100 milliseconds,

139
0:13:12.000 --> 0:13:15.000
you've lost 20 percent of people.

140
0:13:15.000 --> 0:13:18.000
They will go back. They'll click the back button.

141
0:13:18.000 --> 0:13:24.000
They'll go out and go somewhere else because you're not sure if it's loading or not.

142
0:13:24.000 --> 0:13:27.000
You get information when you bring it in.

143
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:35.000
Bring this into your own organization because it allows you to connect with your community.

144
0:13:35.000 --> 0:13:42.000
And you get to every single donation should have a thank you from your project.

145
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:46.000
You should never leave people out hanging, saying,

146
0:13:46.000 --> 0:13:52.000
oh, I just sent this money into the ether. I hope it does something good.

147
0:13:52.000 --> 0:13:54.000
Send them a thank you.

148
0:13:54.000 --> 0:13:58.000
Send them a thank you because it lets them know that the community has received it,

149
0:13:58.000 --> 0:14:04.000
that they appreciate it, and you include in there a link into your forum,

150
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:11.000
into your bug tracker, into the other ways that the community connects.

151
0:14:11.000 --> 0:14:21.000
And this allows you to build these communities that bind all of us together more closely.

152
0:14:21.000 --> 0:14:23.000
And finally, test.

153
0:14:23.000 --> 0:14:27.000
Real quick, A-B testing, piece of cake.

154
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:30.000
Never change everything outright.

155
0:14:30.000 --> 0:14:33.000
Never make a new donation page and get rid of your old one.

156
0:14:33.000 --> 0:14:36.000
You make donate 41.

157
0:14:36.000 --> 0:14:39.000
You want to change something, you make donate 42.

158
0:14:39.000 --> 0:14:44.000
And the only thing that you need to change is some simple little JavaScript.

159
0:14:44.000 --> 0:14:48.000
If math.random is less than.5, go to this one.

160
0:14:48.000 --> 0:14:50.000
Otherwise, go to that one.

161
0:14:50.000 --> 0:14:56.000
Two different pages, and each of them should have an embedded code in there,

162
0:14:56.000 --> 0:15:00.000
an embedded number that you get to send to Stripe

163
0:15:00.000 --> 0:15:04.000
because you're controlling your own donation pipeline now.

164
0:15:04.000 --> 0:15:08.000
So you get to send that to Stripe, you get to send that to PayPal,

165
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:12.000
so that when you do this, when you make a change,

166
0:15:12.000 --> 0:15:15.000
you get to look for your metrics,

167
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:21.000
and you get to measure what the changes effect is.

168
0:15:21.000 --> 0:15:26.000
And whether you are trying to get people to join your mailing list

169
0:15:26.000 --> 0:15:29.000
because you want to announce releases

170
0:15:29.000 --> 0:15:34.000
or you want to get them to support the project or new users coming in,

171
0:15:34.000 --> 0:15:39.000
whatever it is, you are trying to change.

172
0:15:39.000 --> 0:15:43.000
You won't know if you've achieved it unless you're measuring it.

173
0:15:43.000 --> 0:15:48.000
So measure it in a way that respects people's privacy.

174
0:15:48.000 --> 0:15:54.000
Measure it in a way that allows you to be the most effective you can

175
0:15:54.000 --> 0:15:56.000
in building your community.

176
0:15:56.000 --> 0:16:02.000
And finally, every donation is an opportunity to build your community

177
0:16:02.000 --> 0:16:10.000
because your donors are the most invested customers in your project.

178
0:16:10.000 --> 0:16:12.000
And you should treat them that way.

179
0:16:12.000 --> 0:16:20.000
You should bring them in because they saw fit to support you financially.

180
0:16:20.000 --> 0:16:30.000
They deserve to have that community wrap them in ways that are supportive

181
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:35.000
and give them the opportunity to be part of the larger project.

182
0:16:35.000 --> 0:16:37.000
Every donor gets a thank you email,

183
0:16:37.000 --> 0:16:40.000
and then give them ways to deepen that connection,

184
0:16:40.000 --> 0:16:44.000
offer them things that are straightforward.

185
0:16:44.000 --> 0:16:50.000
So t-shirts for donation levels or badges on your user forum,

186
0:16:50.000 --> 0:16:57.000
all of these are ways to build that connection between your community and your project.

187
0:16:57.000 --> 0:17:00.000
And then directed donations give you more information

188
0:17:00.000 --> 0:17:04.000
about what your users are interested in.

189
0:17:04.000 --> 0:17:07.000
Finally, support your upstream.

190
0:17:07.000 --> 0:17:11.000
Because all of us stand on each other's shoulders.

191
0:17:11.000 --> 0:17:16.000
So when you are, whether you are a houseplant, open source project,

192
0:17:16.000 --> 0:17:20.000
just doing this for yourself or you're a big large project,

193
0:17:20.000 --> 0:17:24.000
if you're receiving donations, pass that up.

194
0:17:24.000 --> 0:17:29.000
Because the things that allow you to build your project

195
0:17:29.000 --> 0:17:34.000
and allow all of us to do better are the things that we should be supporting ourselves.

196
0:17:34.000 --> 0:17:38.000
So last couple of tips.

197
0:17:38.000 --> 0:17:40.000
Be transparent.

198
0:17:40.000 --> 0:17:45.000
Show people how much processing charges are in the project.

199
0:17:45.000 --> 0:17:50.000
And allow them to donate a specific amount to your project.

200
0:17:50.000 --> 0:17:55.000
You can add a small checkbox to round up to the donation amount.

201
0:17:55.000 --> 0:18:00.000
And always, always, always, if you're doing your donation page, watch for fraud.

202
0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:08.000
Because there are a lot of bad actors who will automatically try to use your donation page

203
0:18:08.000 --> 0:18:12.000
to verify stolen credit card numbers.

204
0:18:12.000 --> 0:18:17.000
So when you do this, you watch out for this because it's not just an ethical responsibility,

205
0:18:17.000 --> 0:18:22.000
it's a financial responsibility to actually make sure that people are not being charged

206
0:18:22.000 --> 0:18:25.000
for things that they don't know.

207
0:18:25.000 --> 0:18:30.000
And so in this case, you can see this was all within one minute.

208
0:18:30.000 --> 0:18:35.000
This is actual attack on the KiCad donation website.

209
0:18:35.000 --> 0:18:38.000
It's like 30 donations per minute.

210
0:18:38.000 --> 0:18:42.000
They were just cycling through a bunch of credit cards.

211
0:18:42.000 --> 0:18:45.000
And we found the one that they work, that they succeeded,

212
0:18:45.000 --> 0:18:47.000
and we reported it as fraud.

213
0:18:47.000 --> 0:18:50.000
And they stop after you do that for a little while.

214
0:18:50.000 --> 0:18:52.000
So thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

215
0:18:52.000 --> 0:18:55.000
If there are any questions, I'm happy to take them.

216
0:18:55.000 --> 0:19:02.000
APPLAUSE

217
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:09.000
Not actually a question, but I think I don't now remember which open source project it was.

218
0:19:09.000 --> 0:19:12.000
But it might have been KiCad, actually, even.

219
0:19:12.000 --> 0:19:15.000
But I remember it was very nice to have like a donation page,

220
0:19:15.000 --> 0:19:20.000
which then listed a bunch of new features kind of that came up recently.

221
0:19:20.000 --> 0:19:24.000
And just said that these were made possible thanks to your customers.

222
0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:25.000
Yes.

223
0:19:25.000 --> 0:19:26.000
I think that was an excellent way.

224
0:19:26.000 --> 0:19:28.000
Because it's true.

225
0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:29.000
Yeah.

226
0:19:29.000 --> 0:19:36.000
So the statement was that there was that you can show what the donations have done.

227
0:19:36.000 --> 0:19:40.000
And one of the things that KiCad does is after you donate,

228
0:19:40.000 --> 0:19:43.000
it shows you a thank you page after the donation,

229
0:19:43.000 --> 0:19:48.000
and that it has a little graphic of all the things that we've done in the past year.

230
0:19:48.000 --> 0:19:51.000
And we update that about once a year or so.

231
0:19:51.000 --> 0:19:52.000
So yeah.

232
0:19:52.000 --> 0:19:55.000
Yeah. There we go.

233
0:19:55.000 --> 0:19:56.000
Yes.

234
0:19:56.000 --> 0:20:03.000
How and why did you understand that this implementation was in successfully?

235
0:20:03.000 --> 0:20:09.000
So the question was how and why do we know that we needed to make changes?

236
0:20:09.000 --> 0:20:12.000
We weren't where we needed to be.

237
0:20:12.000 --> 0:20:18.000
So we wanted to support full-time developers.

238
0:20:18.000 --> 0:20:22.000
And we did not have the funding level to be able to do that.

239
0:20:22.000 --> 0:20:30.000
So we wanted to increase that to be able to develop the project faster and better.

240
0:20:30.000 --> 0:20:37.000
And we knew because we periodically dog-fooded ourselves.

241
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:43.000
We'd try and the developers will donate, not just our time,

242
0:20:43.000 --> 0:20:46.000
but we'll practice going through the donation page.

243
0:20:46.000 --> 0:20:47.000
And it was painful.

244
0:20:47.000 --> 0:20:50.000
So we'd click and we'd be like, oh, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

245
0:20:50.000 --> 0:20:52.000
And then we'd get there.

246
0:20:52.000 --> 0:21:00.000
And I had to pull up the, like, how much is 120 Swiss franc in euro?

247
0:21:00.000 --> 0:21:02.000
And now I know.

248
0:21:02.000 --> 0:21:05.000
But intuitively, I didn't know that.

249
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:11.000
So we, dog-fooding what you build is an important step.

250
0:21:11.000 --> 0:21:16.000
And it costs you a $5 donation, which is, you know, you run it through there

251
0:21:16.000 --> 0:21:20.000
and you're supporting a good project when you do this.

252
0:21:20.000 --> 0:21:21.000
Yes?

253
0:21:21.000 --> 0:21:27.000
How do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

254
0:21:27.000 --> 0:21:31.000
Yeah, so the question is how do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

255
0:21:31.000 --> 0:21:37.000
So we have right here a highlighted one-time and monthly.

256
0:21:37.000 --> 0:21:44.000
So we have this option and you can set up the back end to do that.

257
0:21:44.000 --> 0:21:50.000
Right now we only support that through PayPal because we don't want to be responsible

258
0:21:50.000 --> 0:21:53.000
for keeping track of user accounts.

259
0:21:53.000 --> 0:21:58.000
And PayPal allows you to set up subscriptions without the user account.

260
0:21:58.000 --> 0:22:01.000
So right now we do that through PayPal.

261
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:06.000
But the thing to watch out for is to make sure in your design that you're very,

262
0:22:06.000 --> 0:22:09.000
very clear about what the user is doing.

263
0:22:09.000 --> 0:22:12.000
Are they, do they have a subscription or do they have a one-time?

264
0:22:12.000 --> 0:22:16.000
So when you click on this, instead of saying donate, this is donate via PayPal

265
0:22:16.000 --> 0:22:18.000
or donate via credit card, e-wallet.

266
0:22:18.000 --> 0:22:22.000
Instead of saying donate, we change that to subscribe.

267
0:22:22.000 --> 0:22:27.000
So we do a couple of things to make it really, really obvious

268
0:22:27.000 --> 0:22:33.000
that if you move this slider over here and click on this button,

269
0:22:33.000 --> 0:22:36.000
you're signing up for a monthly subscription.

270
0:22:36.000 --> 0:22:38.000
We still have people making the mistake though.

271
0:22:38.000 --> 0:22:44.000
So we're still working out, we're still doing A-B testing to see can we get that better.

272
0:22:44.000 --> 0:22:45.000
Yes?

273
0:22:45.000 --> 0:22:46.000
It's more of a suggestion then.

274
0:22:46.000 --> 0:22:47.000
Great.

275
0:22:47.000 --> 0:22:50.000
So make sure Amazon has the one-click button on the right.

276
0:22:50.000 --> 0:22:51.000
Yes.

277
0:22:51.000 --> 0:22:53.000
It's kind of in there, you got subscribe.

278
0:22:53.000 --> 0:22:55.000
So it will give them the opportunity.

279
0:22:55.000 --> 0:22:58.000
The suggestion is to have a separate button for the subscribe.

280
0:22:58.000 --> 0:23:00.000
Yes, that's, that's.

281
0:23:00.000 --> 0:23:03.000
We try to check out, just keep those because you've got two ways.

282
0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:06.000
I'm going to A-B test that and we'll see what comes out.

283
0:23:06.000 --> 0:23:07.000
Yes?

284
0:23:07.000 --> 0:23:09.000
If you're worried about putting all your eggs in one basket,

285
0:23:09.000 --> 0:23:12.000
in terms of like, I have an open collective account.

286
0:23:12.000 --> 0:23:13.000
Yes.

287
0:23:13.000 --> 0:23:17.000
How does this put my credit card information into K,

288
0:23:17.000 --> 0:23:20.000
why can't I just do it with that open collective account?

289
0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:21.000
You absolutely can.

290
0:23:21.000 --> 0:23:29.000
And I skipped by a couple of the options here on for, here we go.

291
0:23:29.000 --> 0:23:34.000
So open collective, Petran, coffee, Linux Foundation,

292
0:23:34.000 --> 0:23:38.000
if that's where your community is, do that.

293
0:23:38.000 --> 0:23:39.000
Absolutely.

294
0:23:39.000 --> 0:23:40.000
That's fantastic.

295
0:23:40.000 --> 0:23:44.000
If your, if your community is on coffee, you should be,

296
0:23:44.000 --> 0:23:46.000
you should have coffee on there.

297
0:23:46.000 --> 0:23:51.000
But, but there's a, there's a balance to be struck.

298
0:23:51.000 --> 0:23:58.000
And open collective is nice, but it's one, two, three clicks deep.

299
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:03.000
You, and we don't, we've never seen a way to shorten that and we can't cash it.

300
0:24:03.000 --> 0:24:08.000
So it does add a couple steps, but I do know a lot of projects that,

301
0:24:08.000 --> 0:24:11.000
that use it, that use it successfully and that like it a lot.

302
0:24:11.000 --> 0:24:15.000
So definitely, you know, test it out.

303
0:24:15.000 --> 0:24:18.000
But, you know, try to replace one of the buttons,

304
0:24:18.000 --> 0:24:23.000
A, B testing with open collective and see if that's where your community is.

305
0:24:23.000 --> 0:24:26.000
And the only way you know that is by checking.

306
0:24:26.000 --> 0:24:29.000
Yeah, so I think we're a little bit over time.

307
0:24:29.000 --> 0:24:31.000
So, yeah, you can all come up with a question.

308
0:24:31.000 --> 0:24:32.000
Thank you.

309
0:24:32.000 --> 0:24:50.000
Thank you.
