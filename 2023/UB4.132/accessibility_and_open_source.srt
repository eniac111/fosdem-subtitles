1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Well, thank you all for coming. This is great. Now, where are my notes? They're not on the

2
0:00:10.680 --> 0:00:14.180
screen. It's never good to go off and to give a talk where it's like, I cannot see what's

3
0:00:14.180 --> 0:00:20.340
on the screen behind me. So, let's see if I can change that. And there you go. So, my

4
0:00:20.340 --> 0:00:25.580
name is Mike Gifford. I'm with Civic Actions. I'm a senior strategist there. What I do there

5
0:00:25.580 --> 0:00:32.320
is a lot of work on accessibility and sustainability. I'm also a Drupal core accessibility maintainer.

6
0:00:32.320 --> 0:00:37.920
And I like to do a lot of talks on open source and accessibility and why it matters. Because

7
0:00:37.920 --> 0:00:41.240
I think that there's something unique with our community that we can do, changes that

8
0:00:41.240 --> 0:00:48.240
we can make that make a huge impact. So, and also just as a disclaimer, I'm not a designer.

9
0:00:48.240 --> 0:00:55.240
I'm a PHP developer that sort of got the, you know, wandered into accessibility and then

10
0:00:55.240 --> 0:01:00.640
suddenly had to deal with a lot of front-end stuff that I was not familiar with prior to

11
0:01:00.640 --> 0:01:05.640
getting involved. So, definitely appreciate having all these, the attention of the designers

12
0:01:05.640 --> 0:01:11.520
and that I've learned a lot from the design community I've worked with. But, a couple

13
0:01:11.520 --> 0:01:16.120
things I assume that everyone here knows about open source. So, there's a great range of

14
0:01:16.120 --> 0:01:20.520
open source tools. We know that there's only, you know, here we're going to be talking about

15
0:01:20.520 --> 0:01:24.280
a few of them, but there's lots of really good accessibility open source tools out there.

16
0:01:24.280 --> 0:01:30.440
I also want to go off and, you know, look at those. As you know, there's a lot of open

17
0:01:30.440 --> 0:01:35.080
source tools that are really not, they're essentially dead in the water. Somebody released

18
0:01:35.080 --> 0:01:41.920
the project. They don't have a community around them. I think focusing on those pieces of

19
0:01:41.920 --> 0:01:48.920
software around accessibility that actually have a group of, that are actively engaged

20
0:01:48.920 --> 0:01:52.720
really does matter, especially if you're starting to get involved with them. I'm also going

21
0:01:52.720 --> 0:01:58.160
to use the short-term OSS for open source software. As far as accessibility, I just

22
0:01:58.160 --> 0:02:01.160
want to remind people that it's not a small portion of the population. We're not just

23
0:02:01.160 --> 0:02:05.640
talking about people who are blind. We're talking about 25% of the population. And if

24
0:02:05.640 --> 0:02:10.960
you look at permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities, you're talking about 100% of

25
0:02:10.960 --> 0:02:17.160
the population. Right now, you can probably all see the slides here, but if the sun were

26
0:02:17.160 --> 0:02:20.320
in a slightly different position, you know, there would be a point where you may not be

27
0:02:20.320 --> 0:02:24.560
able to see that, even in this presentation, just because we've got these gorgeous open

28
0:02:24.560 --> 0:02:29.760
windows and, you know, yeah. So we have to go off and think about how accessibility can

29
0:02:29.760 --> 0:02:34.560
affect all of us. We also have to keep in mind that there's both visible and invisible

30
0:02:34.560 --> 0:02:39.840
disabilities. Many of us, how many here know that they work with people with disabilities?

31
0:02:39.840 --> 0:02:45.200
Okay. There's a lot of people who don't know because you can't tell somebody who's colorblind.

32
0:02:45.200 --> 0:02:49.760
You can't tell somebody who's dyslexic. You can't tell somebody who has low vision. There's

33
0:02:49.760 --> 0:02:54.160
a lot of disabilities you cannot tell by looking at somebody from the outside. Even people

34
0:02:54.160 --> 0:02:57.560
who are legally blind, you may not know that they are legally blind because they've learned

35
0:02:57.560 --> 0:03:02.080
how to go off and interact with them, or interact with you. I'm also going to use the short-term

36
0:03:02.080 --> 0:03:08.320
ALI, which is a numerum. There's 11 letters between A and Y, and it's what it stands

37
0:03:08.320 --> 0:03:20.640
for. So why open source and accessibility? So bugs. Bugs are a big one. When in most

38
0:03:20.640 --> 0:03:24.920
proprietary projects, you don't actually get to see a list of the issues that are there.

39
0:03:24.920 --> 0:03:30.080
You don't get to get an opportunity to see who made what problems have already been reported,

40
0:03:30.080 --> 0:03:34.720
but in open source communities, basically every one of them has an issue queue, and

41
0:03:34.720 --> 0:03:41.360
often those issues are either identified as bugs, which is an important clarification.

42
0:03:41.360 --> 0:03:45.960
Accessibility issues should not be future requests. They should be bugs. And they should

43
0:03:45.960 --> 0:03:49.840
be tagged for accessibility, which many of them are so that people can find them more

44
0:03:49.840 --> 0:03:54.000
quickly. With the Drupal community, we've actually started the process of trying to

45
0:03:54.000 --> 0:03:59.480
tag them for specific WCAG success criteria. The advantage of that is that you can actually

46
0:03:59.480 --> 0:04:06.680
start to understand who is affected by the accessibility challenges and have a more fine-grained

47
0:04:06.680 --> 0:04:12.720
attempt to understand what are these issues, who does it affect, and how serious a concern

48
0:04:12.720 --> 0:04:18.440
is this. So we're looking to try to do that with the Drupal community.

49
0:04:18.440 --> 0:04:25.280
So open source communities are also really good because they tend to focus on trying

50
0:04:25.280 --> 0:04:33.080
to have a... try to find a merit-based approach argument. So you're not looking for something

51
0:04:33.080 --> 0:04:40.000
that is who's the most popular in the community. You want to try and find a best-cased argument

52
0:04:40.000 --> 0:04:45.480
for why this is the best pattern for your project. So it's a really interesting experience

53
0:04:45.480 --> 0:04:49.480
from that perspective. It's also neat because anyone can submit a bug. You just need often

54
0:04:49.480 --> 0:04:56.520
an account on GitHub or Mantis or whichever else. That's a really useful feature as well

55
0:04:56.520 --> 0:05:02.520
because you can be inclusive. Does anyone here know where to go off and submit issues

56
0:05:02.520 --> 0:05:11.880
to Office 365 when you run into a bug at Office 365? Yeah. Good luck.

57
0:05:11.880 --> 0:05:17.640
So the other thing is community interest. It's really interesting being involved in

58
0:05:17.640 --> 0:05:21.000
the open source community because people want to have others use their code base. It's part

59
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:25.380
of the whole sort of feeling of this. You don't release the software so that other people

60
0:05:25.380 --> 0:05:29.960
can say, wow, that's really great software. You release it so that people can use it and

61
0:05:29.960 --> 0:05:33.080
say, this is neat. I have to learn from this. This is something that I can use to benefit

62
0:05:33.080 --> 0:05:39.560
me. And so there's an inherent interest in the developers getting access to the code

63
0:05:39.560 --> 0:05:45.920
and engaging with the population. And I think bringing people into the community is something

64
0:05:45.920 --> 0:05:49.480
that's not easy to do, but it's something that many successful open source communities

65
0:05:49.480 --> 0:05:55.520
are able to accomplish. The dripple phrase is, come for the code, stay for the community.

66
0:05:55.520 --> 0:06:00.520
And not that dripple is the only content management system or piece of software out there. It's

67
0:06:00.520 --> 0:06:06.240
one you should all use, of course. But it's not the only one out there. But that idea

68
0:06:06.240 --> 0:06:12.320
is something that's mirrored by many other effective open source tools as well.

69
0:06:12.320 --> 0:06:20.080
I also think that it's something where it takes a village to maintain any piece of software.

70
0:06:20.080 --> 0:06:25.000
The internet changes very quickly. If you want to go off and adjust in time and be able

71
0:06:25.000 --> 0:06:30.040
to make modifications over time, you kind of need to have a large group of people who

72
0:06:30.040 --> 0:06:35.760
you can engage with them on. Some of the accessibility issues are really very complicated. The kinds

73
0:06:35.760 --> 0:06:39.600
of issues that the dripple community has dealt with, even the simple ones. Does everyone

74
0:06:39.600 --> 0:06:47.240
know about CSS display none? There's a really simple CSS code that is a huge accessibility

75
0:06:47.240 --> 0:06:51.080
problem because developers or designers and developers use it to go off and hide certain

76
0:06:51.080 --> 0:06:55.600
pieces of code from the browser so you don't want to see it. But it also hides it from

77
0:06:55.600 --> 0:07:01.800
screen reader users. Trying to go from find a way to hide code visually but not hide it

78
0:07:01.800 --> 0:07:09.240
for people who need to use it for assistive technology is a really big issue still. Technically,

79
0:07:09.240 --> 0:07:15.640
not that complicated, but I'm sure that somebody here could write a PhD on how we dealt with

80
0:07:15.640 --> 0:07:23.040
CSS and the challenges of CSS displaying none in the dripple community. Learning and sharing

81
0:07:23.040 --> 0:07:27.320
is important. Trying to be able to engage with others. What we learn in dripple, we

82
0:07:27.320 --> 0:07:31.760
try and share with WordPress and Joomla and Type03 and others. Again, that's something

83
0:07:31.760 --> 0:07:41.920
we can benefit from that is unique to the open source community. Codes of conduct.

84
0:07:41.920 --> 0:07:47.640
Diversity accessibility is part of a DIA framework, the idea of diversity equity inclusion. How

85
0:07:47.640 --> 0:07:52.680
do you try and make sure that we are bringing in people and having a structure to go off

86
0:07:52.680 --> 0:07:57.360
and see that there is more diversity represented and you're not just having a bunch of white

87
0:07:57.360 --> 0:08:07.880
guys speaking at events is really important. Having that structure is useful for accessibility.

88
0:08:07.880 --> 0:08:12.120
You don't necessarily have this for a piece of commercial software, but if you're trying

89
0:08:12.120 --> 0:08:16.040
to engage a community, you're probably going to eventually, if you grow big enough, have

90
0:08:16.040 --> 0:08:21.400
a code of conduct that deals with feedback mechanisms, deals with bad actors, deals with

91
0:08:21.400 --> 0:08:27.840
people who act like people do sometimes. We don't always act in the most dignified and

92
0:08:27.840 --> 0:08:33.720
organized and respectful manners, even in our issue queues. Having forums to try and

93
0:08:33.720 --> 0:08:38.400
help moderate and manage that is important. The in-person events are also quite useful.

94
0:08:38.400 --> 0:08:43.320
Again, you get to meet people. I don't know if there's anyone here who is blind or low

95
0:08:43.320 --> 0:08:46.200
vision, but there certainly have been other people at this conference who have seen who

96
0:08:46.200 --> 0:08:53.680
are either in a wheelchair or using a guide dog. There have been some people here who

97
0:08:53.680 --> 0:09:00.120
have permanent disabilities that we would typically identify as being more severely

98
0:09:00.120 --> 0:09:04.000
disabled. A lot of times community events like this will think about that. There will

99
0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:08.360
be an accessibility page. People will ask questions about the accessibility of the website.

100
0:09:08.360 --> 0:09:16.160
That also really helps. There's a low cost of entry. This may be a surprise to you.

101
0:09:16.160 --> 0:09:24.400
But people who are disabled in our economy are generally the least well off. They're

102
0:09:24.400 --> 0:09:31.640
the poorest of the poor because they often get a subsidy from the government. They often

103
0:09:31.640 --> 0:09:37.880
cannot get jobs. That subsidy is often below their living wage. But just a quick joke.

104
0:09:37.880 --> 0:09:41.920
Who here knows who the richest blind user in the world is? Who's the richest blind

105
0:09:41.920 --> 0:09:49.080
user in the world? It's not Stevie Wonder. It's Google. Google is a blind user. Can't

106
0:09:49.080 --> 0:09:57.520
see. Also, students are another element of low income populations. If you want to attract

107
0:09:57.520 --> 0:10:01.480
students and engage students, open source is a great way to do that. There's a focus

108
0:10:01.480 --> 0:10:06.240
on training materials, trying to bring people in and to document things. If you can document

109
0:10:06.240 --> 0:10:12.760
an accessible way to do things, if you can provide a best practice that addresses accessibility

110
0:10:12.760 --> 0:10:18.720
issues, it's much more likely that other people will follow that practice going ahead. It's

111
0:10:18.720 --> 0:10:23.040
also really useful for a lot of open source communities to have a community where you

112
0:10:23.040 --> 0:10:27.280
can reach out to an expert and get feedback if you get stuck. The number of stupid questions

113
0:10:27.280 --> 0:10:30.880
I've asked that I've been able to get somebody who knows a lot more than me to be able to

114
0:10:30.880 --> 0:10:35.240
help move me ahead so I can learn a little more about the project. It's really quite

115
0:10:35.240 --> 0:10:42.800
important. Interoperability and standards. When I first started getting involved in accessibility

116
0:10:42.800 --> 0:10:48.000
in Drupal, I thought, oh, because Drupal cares about standards, I can probably go off and

117
0:10:48.000 --> 0:10:53.120
fix up the accessibility issues in Drupal in, I don't know, a year or two. Shouldn't

118
0:10:53.120 --> 0:10:57.920
be a big deal because we care about open standards. Here we are more than a decade after me being

119
0:10:57.920 --> 0:11:03.120
deeply involved in accessibility issues and we're not there yet. We're further ahead.

120
0:11:03.120 --> 0:11:07.520
There's one of the most successful open source projects in the world but there's just a lot

121
0:11:07.520 --> 0:11:11.880
of issues that you, it's a complex issue. There's a lot of, the more you dig, the further

122
0:11:11.880 --> 0:11:16.560
you know, the more there is to do. It's an ongoing process and the goal of accessibility

123
0:11:16.560 --> 0:11:22.680
really is to try and get, to be more accessible today than you were yesterday. That's the

124
0:11:22.680 --> 0:11:30.520
goal. Let's see. If you're looking at an open source project and you're trying to figure

125
0:11:30.520 --> 0:11:35.280
out how to go off and get acceptance and whatnot around that, just talking about open standards

126
0:11:35.280 --> 0:11:40.840
and the value of interoperability, the value of, like if you build two standards that meet

127
0:11:40.840 --> 0:11:46.640
accessibility, it'll also be useful for future use cases as well. Like, I don't know, how

128
0:11:46.640 --> 0:11:52.400
many people here are designing for voice interfaces? Okay. You're not doing it now but probably

129
0:11:52.400 --> 0:11:56.400
in the next FOSFSTM or one afterwards you're probably going to be designing for voice interfaces.

130
0:11:56.400 --> 0:12:02.000
If you build for accessibility, it'll be much easier to interact with your voice interfaces

131
0:12:02.000 --> 0:12:05.520
because the semantics are built in there and that's what really is important for driving

132
0:12:05.520 --> 0:12:12.000
voice interfaces. Yeah. Open standards and just having communities that care about this

133
0:12:12.000 --> 0:12:16.280
stuff. This is something that it takes a while to go off and to build up and maintain and

134
0:12:16.280 --> 0:12:21.880
to sustain that sort of caring about it when you've got deadlines and ideas of, you know,

135
0:12:21.880 --> 0:12:28.640
yeah, product deadlines and client deadlines and all that sort of stuff. So open accessibility

136
0:12:28.640 --> 0:12:34.400
reporting, I wanted to talk a little bit about this. This is a, in the US, VPATs are a much

137
0:12:34.400 --> 0:12:40.160
bigger deal. So VPAT is the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template. This is not something

138
0:12:40.160 --> 0:12:45.280
that is very common in Europe because VPATs were a good effort 20 years ago but they don't

139
0:12:45.280 --> 0:12:48.200
really cut the mustard in the rest of the world. They're not good enough for Europe

140
0:12:48.200 --> 0:12:57.120
and they shouldn't be because they're largely a sales document at this point. But the WC3

141
0:12:57.120 --> 0:13:02.000
went off and produced an evaluation methodology that's really quite useful and was developed

142
0:13:02.000 --> 0:13:07.080
in Holland and was able to meet with Hiddi DeReeves who went off and developed the tool

143
0:13:07.080 --> 0:13:12.680
that is behind the WCAG EM license. There's an interface that allows you to go from, to

144
0:13:12.680 --> 0:13:16.840
guide you through the process of doing an accessibility report. And one of the neat

145
0:13:16.840 --> 0:13:24.600
things about this is it has the ability to write a machine readable document that describes

146
0:13:24.600 --> 0:13:28.920
the website you're meeting, you're trying to address. So if you're looking at an institutional

147
0:13:28.920 --> 0:13:34.560
website, if you have the ability to have a machine readable, you can compare all of the

148
0:13:34.560 --> 0:13:39.200
instances of all the software, all the licenses in one place. You can get a sense of how your

149
0:13:39.200 --> 0:13:43.960
website compares to how accessible it is today versus how accessible it was two years ago.

150
0:13:43.960 --> 0:13:48.960
Having that ability to manage that is really quite useful. And civic actions went off and

151
0:13:48.960 --> 0:13:54.920
liked the idea of having something for procurement that could satisfy the VPAT requirements but

152
0:13:54.920 --> 0:14:05.240
followed the modern model that the WCAG EM implemented. So we forked the WC3's WCAG EM

153
0:14:05.240 --> 0:14:13.920
methodology and we created OpenACR which is an open source platform for creating accessibility

154
0:14:13.920 --> 0:14:19.200
confirmation reports. So if you're looking at providing reporting of different products,

155
0:14:19.200 --> 0:14:24.280
the OpenACR is a good format to do that and it was developed and paid for by the US government

156
0:14:24.280 --> 0:14:33.200
but it's available for everyone. So cooperation versus competition. I want to say that there's

157
0:14:33.200 --> 0:14:39.260
a neat thing about open source is there's a great deal of both. Yeah, there's tension

158
0:14:39.260 --> 0:14:45.520
but we collaborate with each other. It's really quite nice. I'm on the Drupal Slack channel

159
0:14:45.520 --> 0:14:48.880
of course but I'm also on the Twitter Slack channel so people can catch me in either of

160
0:14:48.880 --> 0:14:53.840
those, not the Twitter, the WordPress Slack channel. So you can catch me in either of

161
0:14:53.840 --> 0:15:02.800
those places even though they're often conflicting areas. But an area we worked with recently

162
0:15:02.800 --> 0:15:07.280
was working with the European Commission with the WeFor Authors cluster and this was an

163
0:15:07.280 --> 0:15:15.000
effort to take the authoring tools and how do we try and make the authoring tools better

164
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:20.880
so that the authors are able to go and to create, it would be easier for authors to

165
0:15:20.880 --> 0:15:26.260
create accessible content. Right now most accessibility errors are caused by authors

166
0:15:26.260 --> 0:15:32.080
who use WCAG editors to go off and create the content and there isn't necessarily enough

167
0:15:32.080 --> 0:15:39.440
guidelines to structure them into doing the creating good accessible content. There's

168
0:15:39.440 --> 0:15:45.720
something called the ATAG, which is the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines and ATAG Part

169
0:15:45.720 --> 0:15:49.280
B is all about trying to make it easier for people to do the right thing with accessibility

170
0:15:49.280 --> 0:15:53.840
if you're creating a content and generally the authoring interfaces are not given enough

171
0:15:53.840 --> 0:15:58.400
attention. This is the only study that I know of that certainly the Drupal community has

172
0:15:58.400 --> 0:16:04.640
done to try and say how do we engage with authors to try and find ways to help authors

173
0:16:04.640 --> 0:16:10.320
create better content. That's not something that is done often enough. And I also want

174
0:16:10.320 --> 0:16:16.200
to just phrase the Drupal's proudly found elsewhere, this idea that you don't have to

175
0:16:16.200 --> 0:16:21.280
build it all yourself. There are times where you can pick another project like we don't

176
0:16:21.280 --> 0:16:26.320
have our own WYSIWYG editor, we use CKE editor. So when we have an accessibility problem in

177
0:16:26.320 --> 0:16:32.320
CKE editor, we push it back upstream. We're involved in engaging upstream with other open

178
0:16:32.320 --> 0:16:38.720
source projects. So I want to say it's really important for people, I know I'm running out

179
0:16:38.720 --> 0:16:44.480
of time, but the idea of engaging with people and having lived experience. People with disabilities

180
0:16:44.480 --> 0:16:50.480
have a lot of additional ideas to share and to contribute to your open source projects.

181
0:16:50.480 --> 0:16:55.640
So don't rely on the automated tools, don't rely on your manual testing, don't rely on

182
0:16:55.640 --> 0:17:01.320
your third party accessibility auditor. Try and bring in, those things are all good, they're

183
0:17:01.320 --> 0:17:05.680
all useful. But if you actually have people with lived experience with disability testing

184
0:17:05.680 --> 0:17:10.120
your interface, you will have a much different experience. You will have something you will

185
0:17:10.120 --> 0:17:16.160
learn a lot more. And we can't necessarily assume that everyone with a disability has

186
0:17:16.160 --> 0:17:22.200
the, like not every blind screen reader user is going to have the same experience. You're

187
0:17:22.200 --> 0:17:26.320
going to, just like regular people, they're going to have a different experience with

188
0:17:26.320 --> 0:17:29.840
the interface and they're going to use things differently and navigate differently to manage

189
0:17:29.840 --> 0:17:38.880
the interface. Yeah, so the more diverse people you engage with, the more robust and structured

190
0:17:38.880 --> 0:17:44.240
thing you're going to have. So it's definitely useful there. Talent is another big one. Thinking

191
0:17:44.240 --> 0:17:50.840
that you have open source projects need talent and there's a real need to try and build up

192
0:17:50.840 --> 0:17:57.480
and to involve those people with a range of different skills and requirements. But also

193
0:17:57.480 --> 0:18:05.180
people with disabilities are often very qualified but are restricted from working for, even

194
0:18:05.180 --> 0:18:09.960
for tech projects. Whether that's because they don't want to go into the office or because

195
0:18:09.960 --> 0:18:14.520
it's too difficult or order us for them to work with somebody else's IT infrastructure.

196
0:18:14.520 --> 0:18:23.520
Because the interfaces that they work with are not built for accessibility. There's also

197
0:18:23.520 --> 0:18:29.920
often not a culture of addressing and including people with disabilities within your organization.

198
0:18:29.920 --> 0:18:35.440
So just making it so that you're as much as possible removing the stigma and seeing disability

199
0:18:35.440 --> 0:18:39.840
is not something that you have to make special adjustments for but it's really a point of

200
0:18:39.840 --> 0:18:45.040
innovation and a point of, yeah, it's a learning point for everyone to go up and build better

201
0:18:45.040 --> 0:18:50.280
products if you have people who interact differently with the web. So sort of thinking about that

202
0:18:50.280 --> 0:18:55.320
talent aspect when you're looking at your organization. Innovation, we've got Deque's

203
0:18:55.320 --> 0:19:01.800
Axe, we've got tools like Luxembourg's Simply Alley PDF caller. My slides are all available

204
0:19:01.800 --> 0:19:06.720
so all this stuff is going to be up online. There's a tool called Alley Watch, we're using

205
0:19:06.720 --> 0:19:10.680
that right now which is doing some incredibly fast scanning of websites. We're looking at

206
0:19:10.680 --> 0:19:15.880
being able to do government wide accessibility scans. We're also seeing tools like Sally

207
0:19:15.880 --> 0:19:20.000
and Editorally which help to go off and support the authoring environment to give feedback

208
0:19:20.000 --> 0:19:25.640
to authors who are in accessibility. I'm a big fan of Microsoft's accessibility insights.

209
0:19:25.640 --> 0:19:29.720
I've got to say when I went to their office I was shocked at how amazing their team was

210
0:19:29.720 --> 0:19:33.480
and how they were doing so much stuff the right way. I was like, I did have to tell

211
0:19:33.480 --> 0:19:39.200
them that I was in the belly of the evil empire but was really impressed. It was a mind blowing

212
0:19:39.200 --> 0:19:45.840
experience. Also, NDDA is an excellent screen reader developed by two blind developers in

213
0:19:45.840 --> 0:19:52.240
Australia. Think about the money that's gone into tools like JAWS and VoiceOver from corporations

214
0:19:52.240 --> 0:19:57.040
and governments and yet you've got two people who believed in open source that were able

215
0:19:57.040 --> 0:20:03.800
to go off and build a really strong screen reader from that. There's other stuff that's

216
0:20:03.800 --> 0:20:09.640
next but you're going to have to go off and read the slide later and get into that. There's

217
0:20:09.640 --> 0:20:15.000
a lot of enterprise tools that are built on open source tools and there's the ability

218
0:20:15.000 --> 0:20:21.560
to scale and to push up software and to engage with accessibility in your CI CD pipeline

219
0:20:21.560 --> 0:20:26.960
is definitely something that is more and more accessible. Much easier for all organizations

220
0:20:26.960 --> 0:20:36.960
to deal with. Now, if you have any questions, please let me know. Anyone using any accessibility

221
0:20:36.960 --> 0:20:37.960
tools?

222
0:20:37.960 --> 0:21:03.960
Right. You mentioned that one of the best ways of testing applications is to actually

223
0:21:03.960 --> 0:21:10.960
get people who have disabilities ranging and there's all sorts of disabilities to actually

224
0:21:10.960 --> 0:21:17.960
come in with accessibility. Do you know of any resources where we can learn how to do

225
0:21:17.960 --> 0:21:25.960
moderating the accessibility test on people with accessibility issues?

226
0:21:25.960 --> 0:21:33.200
The question is how do we learn how to go off and do accessibility testing and how do

227
0:21:33.200 --> 0:21:41.960
we learn to do usability testing with or usability research with people with disabilities? In

228
0:21:41.960 --> 0:21:47.680
terms of accessibility tests, there are some tools out there. If you look at Microsoft

229
0:21:47.680 --> 0:21:52.120
accessibility insights, there are a series of videos associated with that. As with the

230
0:21:52.120 --> 0:21:58.240
Wave toolbar, there are ones that can walk you through that. They may not be as prominent.

231
0:21:58.240 --> 0:22:04.840
They may not be a what's your first step to get started. They do exist. We have a lot

232
0:22:04.840 --> 0:22:09.080
of accessibility documentation as well which you can find on our sub site there that points

233
0:22:09.080 --> 0:22:16.080
to some of that. It is a bit of an issue. As far as the usability research, I was just

234
0:22:16.080 --> 0:22:22.200
reaching out to the Fable tech labs folks. They do amazing work with people with disabilities.

235
0:22:22.200 --> 0:22:28.480
The thing is that people often expect to have people with disabilities do this for free.

236
0:22:28.480 --> 0:22:33.720
But they don't have a lot of money to go off and sit around and do usability testing. We

237
0:22:33.720 --> 0:22:40.440
should be assuming we are paying people with disabilities to do these tests. By engaging

238
0:22:40.440 --> 0:22:45.080
with Fable, you will be paying people with disabilities to go off and do these tests

239
0:22:45.080 --> 0:22:48.520
and get live feedback from people. You can learn a lot from that process. Not that you

240
0:22:48.520 --> 0:22:52.720
always need to use Fable, but it will help you get some insights on how to do that. Any

241
0:22:52.720 --> 0:22:59.720
other question? One more question? Yep.

242
0:22:59.720 --> 0:23:20.720
You had this DEI mentioned before and I was thinking that we have sort of continued from

243
0:23:20.720 --> 0:23:35.440
this instance of differences in the

244
0:23:35.440 --> 0:23:37.440
like feedback and

245
0:23:37.440 --> 0:23:44.520
Experience of like how they experience the software right so like when you do accessibility testing for blind people

246
0:23:44.520 --> 0:23:46.520
You know that there are these difficulties

247
0:23:46.520 --> 0:23:51.360
And I think it's also like very big thing to have a lot of

248
0:23:52.120 --> 0:23:59.760
Newer divers and that yeah, also getting those feedback from the people who are usually maybe more quiet in the crowd

249
0:23:59.760 --> 0:24:03.980
and have their experience also so it will be

250
0:24:09.920 --> 0:24:13.240
For sure I mean there's a I didn't raise

251
0:24:13.840 --> 0:24:19.400
Neurodiversity so the question was about neurodiversity and how do we try and make sure that we encourage more?

252
0:24:20.200 --> 0:24:25.720
more support and testing and engagement with people of different neurodiverse backgrounds and

253
0:24:25.720 --> 0:24:32.440
absolutely and and it's it's you know everything from from cognitive disabilities to

254
0:24:33.320 --> 0:24:34.840
PTSD to

255
0:24:34.840 --> 0:24:37.120
You know looking at people who have have

256
0:24:38.160 --> 0:24:42.840
You know issues with dyslexia like there's a range of different, you know disability people have

257
0:24:43.320 --> 0:24:48.680
Willings that I the WK has really failed on is is they've sort of allowed us to think that you could have one

258
0:24:49.000 --> 0:24:51.320
One sort of website to solve all of your issues

259
0:24:51.320 --> 0:24:58.760
And I'm baffled at how many how many websites don't provide support for even dark mode like all of our browsers and all of our system

260
0:24:58.840 --> 0:25:04.440
Technologies provide support for dark mode. We've got SVGs and other tools that can provide excellent support for dark mode

261
0:25:04.960 --> 0:25:09.640
Why why are doing our design systems not have support for dark mode generally they don't

262
0:25:10.040 --> 0:25:13.200
Why aren't we trying to go off and build for that as part of our expectations?

263
0:25:13.440 --> 0:25:15.440
This is something that would help a lot of people

264
0:25:15.920 --> 0:25:20.560
even if they're people who who just are spending too much time in front of the screen and want to be able to have a little

265
0:25:20.560 --> 0:25:23.640
Bit of a less intense experience especially in the evening

266
0:25:24.160 --> 0:25:26.160
We should be building for that

267
0:25:26.440 --> 0:25:30.720
And it's something that that I hope we do more and I think that that will help a lot of people with with

268
0:25:31.440 --> 0:25:37.760
Neurodiversity issues, but but also just realizing that people like there's a there's a tool that was built by the by the IDRC

269
0:25:37.760 --> 0:25:41.480
Which is the inclusive design research center in Canada?

270
0:25:42.000 --> 0:25:45.880
That that's called the fluid sorry the the the the preferences editor

271
0:25:45.880 --> 0:25:52.120
And it allows you to go off and swap your fonts your colors your you can go from two columns to one column

272
0:25:52.120 --> 0:26:16.200
You can you have a table of contents that explodes and my time is up, so that's all I have to say on the subject

273
0:26:22.120 --> 0:26:24.120
You
