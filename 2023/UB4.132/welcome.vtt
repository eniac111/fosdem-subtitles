Good morning everyone, welcome to the Destiny Lotionation Dev Room.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm going to be very quick and then we can off to Remy.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
So we have one small ask from you.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
You can find this poll of the chair next to the door and the chair also on the desk.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
We want a little bit of feedback because we're trying to get a bigger room with more people.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
And it's still early, but we expect more people to come inside the room today.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
So if you're kind enough, just to fill this in, I'll go anonymously on paper or online.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
And that would be awesome.

00:36.000 --> 01:00.000
We got sit and all of that stuff.
