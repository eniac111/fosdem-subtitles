00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as magic internet money.

00:11.160 --> 00:15.160
It's currently the 15th largest currency in the world.

00:15.160 --> 00:21.800
We feel that Bitcoin embodies a lot of the open source ethics, such as open collaboration

00:21.800 --> 00:24.520
and decentralization.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.360
The last two years, 2021 and 2022, two of my colleagues have also been here speaking

00:31.360 --> 00:33.840
at Fostem.

00:33.840 --> 00:40.320
So I'm very grateful to be here waving the Bitcoin design community flag.

00:40.320 --> 00:45.040
Speaking of the Bitcoin design community, it is pretty young.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.680
It's just two and a half years old.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.880
The mission of the community is to improve the global adoption of Bitcoin.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.800
And that's only possible if we all openly collaborate and work together.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.280
The community basically acts as an online space.

01:01.280 --> 01:07.440
When I say online space, I'm talking about a Slack channel, simple as that.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.440
It's an online community.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.880
There's a whole hub of different projects in that community.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.660
There's even open source projects who just have their own Slack channel.

01:16.660 --> 01:21.000
So they choose to be in that Slack channel and work totally out in the open.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.600
They ask questions.

01:22.600 --> 01:31.520
It's a hive of very busy, active projects all working synchronously and asynchronously.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.560
I will share a little bit of stats about the community.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.540
So we have just over 3,000 Slack members.

01:38.540 --> 01:41.200
We have a couple thousand Twitter followers.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.320
There's a lot of devs in this room.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.760
So when I say closed pool requests, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.120
We complete a lot of calls.

01:48.120 --> 01:53.800
So as I say, a big goal of the community is to help other open source projects.

01:53.800 --> 02:00.960
So we jump on calls with projects who would like to improve their user experience.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.560
And we assist them.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.820
So that's why there's that many calls.

02:05.820 --> 02:12.600
As you can see, not all of the calls are recorded because we have 174 completed calls and 103

02:12.600 --> 02:15.240
YouTube videos.

02:15.240 --> 02:20.360
Then we have a newsletter and we work with basically there's a lot of project collaborations

02:20.360 --> 02:21.620
that we work with.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.080
So we've worked with stratum.

02:23.080 --> 02:27.960
I don't know if some of you have heard of Bitcoin core as well as wallets scrutiny and

02:27.960 --> 02:29.280
blixed.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.360
Any of you heard of any of these projects?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
Cool.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.360
Bitcoin core.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.040
Nice.

02:37.040 --> 02:42.920
So I'll share a little bit about my background.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.360
Many, many years ago I worked as a marketing consultant.

02:47.360 --> 02:55.560
And the reason I worked in marketing was I had a passion for business and strategy and

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
those kinds of things.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.960
But the area in marketing that interested me the most was actually the research part.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.920
And why it actually interested me is because I was always interested in figuring out why

03:06.920 --> 03:08.920
things work the way they did.

03:08.920 --> 03:14.520
I was always interested in getting down to the like the nitty gritty truth about things.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.800
And I have a feeling that there's a couple of people in this room that kind of share

03:18.800 --> 03:20.360
that insight.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.200
Just raise of hands.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.920
Yeah, there's a natural researcher in a couple of us.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.400
So I specialize as a marketing researcher.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.500
And during that time I pretty much worked as a consultant.

03:35.500 --> 03:40.280
So I worked as a consultant for basically like small and medium sized businesses helping

03:40.280 --> 03:48.160
them to devise strategies based on the research that I conducted.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.000
How did I stumble upon UX design?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.760
I was always fascinated with tech.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.480
And I was losing the challenge in working as a marketing consultant.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.740
It was just the challenge that was missing.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.840
So I decided just to go ahead.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.840
There's that accessibility.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.840
I just like, jeez.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.840
Yeah, that would look cool.

04:09.840 --> 04:16.240
No, no, it's good.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.520
So I decided to start studying something else.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.960
And I came across UX design.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.880
And UX design for me was an intersection of three things that I was really passionate

04:25.880 --> 04:26.880
about.

04:26.880 --> 04:31.380
So the intersection of design, psychology, and research all in one.

04:31.380 --> 04:34.640
These were things that I already enjoyed and I was already doing.

04:34.640 --> 04:41.460
So it was a perfect opportunity to combine all of them.

04:41.460 --> 04:46.960
Then I stumbled upon the Bitcoin design community.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.160
Here is a screenshot.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.920
This was just taken last night.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.560
So the community is basically, as I mentioned, it's this hub.

04:55.560 --> 05:00.160
It's very free, very open communication, very relaxed.

05:00.160 --> 05:04.360
And in the community, there are all these different projects that are working out in

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
the open.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.760
They're all open source projects.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.200
Bitcoin Core is one of them.

05:10.200 --> 05:16.080
So I started basically volunteering at this community, as in jobless volunteering, because

05:16.080 --> 05:19.520
I was passionate about working in Bitcoin.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.720
So I started volunteering.

05:20.720 --> 05:25.360
I was just having a whole bunch of fun, jumping on all these different calls.

05:25.360 --> 05:33.120
And then one day, someone came knocking at my door and said, hey, Mo, you're doing some

05:33.120 --> 05:35.600
pretty good work here in the community.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.520
Why didn't you be a UX researcher?

05:38.520 --> 05:43.640
And I was like, me?

05:43.640 --> 05:48.000
There was like imposter syndrome came in from all sorts of different directions.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.840
I know everyone here has dealt one time with imposter syndrome, but it came in from all

05:52.840 --> 05:54.560
sorts of different directions.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.200
The first challenge was the technical challenge, because particularly in the industry that

05:59.200 --> 06:05.160
I work in, the technical know-how is extremely high.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.360
Because of all the terminology, I work in Bitcoin and I work in Lightning.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.320
So there's a lot of what I would use the term gibberish, which now to me doesn't sound like

06:15.320 --> 06:16.320
gibberish anymore.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.600
It makes sense.

06:19.600 --> 06:24.760
So then I started to find some direction.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.800
I met Christoph Onno, who works in the Bitcoin design community.

06:29.800 --> 06:35.560
And he basically said, Mo, why don't you be an evangelist for UX research in the Bitcoin

06:35.560 --> 06:37.440
design community?

06:37.440 --> 06:40.240
Why don't you wave the research flag?

06:40.240 --> 06:43.560
So I said, OK, why not?

06:43.560 --> 06:44.920
Let's give it a shot.

06:44.920 --> 06:52.440
And he then basically suggested to me to create a UX research toolkit for the entire ecosystem

06:52.440 --> 06:58.520
to use so that if they didn't have a UX researcher on their team, they could basically dive into

06:58.520 --> 07:09.320
the toolkit, grab a tool that they felt would be useful, and start using it.

07:09.320 --> 07:15.520
And so I started building.

07:15.520 --> 07:22.200
So my goal was to develop this UX research toolkit, which would basically help projects

07:22.200 --> 07:28.160
in open source to feed back insights and data and knowledge back into their projects so

07:28.160 --> 07:35.480
that they could develop more human-centric products.

07:35.480 --> 07:40.760
But of course, there were some challenges along the way.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.920
There were two very big challenges that I faced.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.200
Within the industry that I work in, UX research is still very much at its infancy.

07:51.200 --> 07:59.160
So building the kit, a big part of my role is getting people to understand the benefits

07:59.160 --> 08:00.900
of UX research.

08:00.900 --> 08:03.360
So that was the first biggest challenge.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.520
The second biggest challenge was no such toolkit actually existed.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.960
So there are UX research toolkits on the market.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.560
If you go into Figma Community and you type in UX research, there are toolkits that exist

08:15.560 --> 08:20.800
on the market for UX research, but not specifically for the industry that I worked in.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.360
So there I was building this kit.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.600
And if I look to the left, hey, can you help me with some advice?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
There's no one there.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.680
If I look to the right, there's also no one there.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.600
So I started building this kit purely based on the projects that I was working with within

08:34.600 --> 08:37.680
the community.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.400
And so I needed to get very hands-on.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.280
It's nice to see that we have someone from Bitcoin Core here in the room, because one

08:45.280 --> 08:48.760
of the projects that I work on is Bitcoin Core.

08:48.760 --> 08:53.220
I've also worked with the Galoi team, and I've also worked on the Blixt Wallet.

08:53.220 --> 08:58.960
So what I actually did was I basically just waved my hand, sent out a Slack message to

08:58.960 --> 09:01.440
these different people in the community.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.840
And I said, hey, can I come jump in and can I come talk to you about UX research?

09:06.840 --> 09:12.200
So I started jumping on these calls and working with these projects, I started to really get

09:12.200 --> 09:18.520
a good feel of what do they need, what kind of insights do they need to be able to build

09:18.520 --> 09:20.280
more human-centric products.

09:20.280 --> 09:26.640
So I started to build the kit from a place of real hands-on experience with different

09:26.640 --> 09:32.600
projects.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.440
But of course, I was working in a silo.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.880
So this is showing the messiness of it.

09:39.880 --> 09:48.240
First started designing different resources, different tools, working in Google documents.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.760
There were files everywhere.

09:50.760 --> 09:55.800
You know, I call it like a, I don't even know what you call it, you know, you're smiling,

09:55.800 --> 09:57.560
you probably recognize this.

09:57.560 --> 10:02.760
There are files everywhere on different platforms, you know.

10:02.760 --> 10:09.320
And I was working in a silo, as I said, because while I had my feet in these projects, I still

10:09.320 --> 10:13.480
was working alone as a UX researcher.

10:13.480 --> 10:19.680
So the first iteration of the UX research toolkit, it was just like, you know, hey,

10:19.680 --> 10:23.680
these are all the different types of UX research tools and methods that are available.

10:23.680 --> 10:28.320
Where they are, I'll design tools and resources for every single thing that's available.

10:28.320 --> 10:34.560
So I went in with that, I would call it naivety.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.120
And then something really interesting happened.

10:38.120 --> 10:45.120
I started to really embody the ethos of working in public.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.760
And I was just speaking with another UX researcher about that.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.560
And the ethos of working in public is basically sharing all of your work out in the public,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.840
even when it's messy.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.880
Yeah, you do the same, I guess.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.280
So it's, you know, I don't, when I share my research or what I'm doing in my research,

11:05.280 --> 11:07.640
I don't share the final presentation.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.000
I share the messy parts.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.880
I share the Google document with the UX research strategy that's half finished.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.320
I'm still building the strategy.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.000
Have a look, everyone.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.040
Do you have anything to contribute?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.360
So this is what I started doing.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.640
And as a result of sharing my work on Twitter, on LinkedIn, and being very public, open and

11:26.640 --> 11:30.680
transparent, people started reaching out to me.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.920
Fellow UX researchers, they started reaching out and they started saying, hey, you're building

11:34.920 --> 11:37.800
something, it looks interesting, could you tell us more about it?

11:37.800 --> 11:41.000
So I started inviting them onto my calls.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.600
And I actually invited them to build with me together.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.760
And then we, so the picture here, where is, the picture's not here.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.440
I added in a picture, one of the slides, maybe it comes up later on, but there's a picture

11:55.440 --> 11:59.080
of a whole bunch of us on the call together.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.920
But basically different UX researchers from different industries, not only the industry

12:02.920 --> 12:07.640
that I work in, they started to jump on these calls and we actually started to together

12:07.640 --> 12:10.360
brainstorm an ID8.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.640
We were like, okay, there's a whole spectrum of UX research tools that are available.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.720
But what in your experience has been the tools that have worked the best for the projects

12:18.720 --> 12:20.400
you've worked on?

12:20.400 --> 12:24.000
So we did it with pure democracy, pure voting.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.400
We just jammed together and we voted.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.520
We voted on which tools we felt would be the best.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.400
And that's how this toolkit, these tools were basically chosen.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.280
Right now we're still building out this first half.

12:37.280 --> 12:43.040
And actually, next week, Tuesday, we have a meeting to discuss which will be the other

12:43.040 --> 12:47.520
half of the research toolkit, because version one's pretty much been decided on.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.800
It's been split out into two halves.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.000
So one half is scope and build out.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.300
So this is if you have no product and you're looking to build from scratch and you want

12:57.300 --> 12:59.720
to build the product from scratch, you have nothing.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.180
You start from zero.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.700
And the other part is shipping the product to market.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.560
So you already have a product, but you need to iterate on the product because you've been

13:07.560 --> 13:09.500
getting a lot of user feedback.

13:09.500 --> 13:15.100
So in our opinion, and this is just guidance and advice, we would say, hey, these might

13:15.100 --> 13:19.060
be the tools you can use if you already have a product.

13:19.060 --> 13:23.080
And these might be the tools that you can use if you're starting out from a new product.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.960
But these are not hard and fast rules.

13:25.960 --> 13:30.000
They're totally open to you and your team and the resources and the time that you have

13:30.000 --> 13:33.320
available.

13:33.320 --> 13:38.820
And of course, because we're researchers, we absolutely wouldn't do it right if we didn't

13:38.820 --> 13:40.780
collect feedback.

13:40.780 --> 13:46.300
So we ran a UX research test on our UX research toolkit.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.780
That was super fun to tweet about.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.380
We had so much fun with that.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.900
And we got feedback about our kit.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.720
So that was a lot of fun.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.140
And so we iterated on the kit.

13:56.140 --> 13:59.620
So what I'm busy doing at the moment now is we've collected all of the UX research and

13:59.620 --> 14:01.180
the feedback from the kit.

14:01.180 --> 14:05.160
And we're now iterating on it and making changes.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.540
Lessons learned.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.220
Very quick one.

14:09.220 --> 14:10.220
Pivot.

14:10.220 --> 14:14.180
Pivot and turn if you think that it's better for the user experience.

14:14.180 --> 14:19.220
So basically, I was developing this kit, working in the silo.

14:19.220 --> 14:24.300
And as a result of realizing that the way I was delivering my product was not going

14:24.300 --> 14:32.580
to be usable for the people I intended it to be used by, I literally did a 180 pivot

14:32.580 --> 14:34.820
within a really short space of time.

14:34.820 --> 14:35.820
And I did it in public.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.100
I was like, hey, guys.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.860
No, this is not going to deliver the right user experience.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.700
So I pivoted.

14:41.700 --> 14:49.540
So the second thing is that building in silo is nice to build in silo if that suits your

14:49.540 --> 14:50.980
personality type.

14:50.980 --> 14:56.580
But if you build as a team and you invite the entire ecosystem to build with you, you

14:56.580 --> 15:00.380
get the insights, the knowledge, and the intelligence of everyone else.

15:00.380 --> 15:04.280
And you get to learn from everyone else as well.

15:04.280 --> 15:11.060
And the last insights is UX research is as much about communication as it is data.

15:11.060 --> 15:17.820
If we would like the developers and the UX designers to take the feedback from our research

15:17.820 --> 15:23.940
on board, we need to learn how to communicate it in a good way and in a visual way.

15:23.940 --> 15:30.300
One of the things that I do is when I feedback my UX research insights to the team, I tend

15:30.300 --> 15:32.580
to not feedback solutions.

15:32.580 --> 15:37.260
But I place the trust and the intelligence in the hands of the team.

15:37.260 --> 15:41.260
And I say to them, listen, guys, this is an insight from a user.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.900
They said they don't understand what this button means.

15:43.900 --> 15:49.940
And then I ask the developers and I ask the UX designers, how can we solve this problem?

15:49.940 --> 15:55.580
So it invites a very open conversation for everyone to come up with a solution together

15:55.580 --> 16:00.140
as opposed to one person coming up with a solution.

16:00.140 --> 16:01.760
That's it for me.

16:01.760 --> 16:06.580
You can find me on Twitter, Mogashni and I do.

16:06.580 --> 16:11.940
Are there any questions?

16:11.940 --> 16:12.940
Shoot.

16:12.940 --> 16:13.940
Thank you.

16:13.940 --> 16:20.940
How do your research methods differ across user types, contributors to node operators

16:20.940 --> 16:22.980
and users?

16:22.980 --> 16:23.980
Could you repeat that, please?

16:23.980 --> 16:26.980
How do your research methods differ across user types, like from node operators, contributors,

16:26.980 --> 16:27.980
and users?

16:27.980 --> 16:32.760
Node operators, users?

16:32.760 --> 16:36.220
And users?

16:36.220 --> 16:39.980
Yeah?

16:39.980 --> 16:41.980
Can you repeat the question?

16:41.980 --> 16:42.980
Yeah, it's just it's.

16:42.980 --> 16:43.980
Am I really quiet?

16:43.980 --> 16:44.980
Okay.

16:44.980 --> 16:45.980
So you know there's different personas that participate in a network.

16:45.980 --> 16:46.980
There's people who might contribute to the network and open a PR.

16:46.980 --> 16:47.980
And then there's people who are end users and adopt a product.

16:47.980 --> 17:00.780
And then there's people who actually run the product.

17:00.780 --> 17:07.540
How do you use different research methods to get feedback from all these people?

17:07.540 --> 17:12.400
So are you more referring to the fact that the user feedback is kind of spread across

17:12.400 --> 17:20.180
like GitHub issues to Twitter, is that kind of the data is kind of spread across different

17:20.180 --> 17:21.180
sources?

17:21.180 --> 17:29.860
That's probably about classifying users into different groups based on their tasks or use

17:29.860 --> 17:31.120
a scenario.

17:31.120 --> 17:36.100
This would be more referring to, and that's a slide there, it would be jobs to be done.

17:36.100 --> 17:40.840
So I'll speak about jobs to be done very briefly.

17:40.840 --> 17:44.820
So Blockstream has kind of popped in the community every now and then.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.500
We've also had some node management platforms also jumping in.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.620
Lightning node management platforms jumping into the platform is community as well.

17:51.620 --> 17:57.740
And they're really moving towards trying to understand the jobs or the tasks that the

17:57.740 --> 18:04.920
interface needs to be able to do to satisfy or make the particular user groups happy.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.760
So how they start this process is phase one is who are the different personas that we're

18:09.760 --> 18:11.140
designing for.

18:11.140 --> 18:17.020
So you could do a persona exercise and identify these different personas by doing ethnographic

18:17.020 --> 18:18.980
research, user interviews.

18:18.980 --> 18:25.060
But you could also do a jobs to be done, which is basically jumping, having a rough idea

18:25.060 --> 18:30.280
of who you think these user groups are, and then having a very umbrella-like conversation

18:30.280 --> 18:35.540
with them and asking them what they need from the interface.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.780
Does that answer your question?

18:38.780 --> 18:39.780
So great talk.

18:39.780 --> 18:40.780
It was really interesting.

18:40.780 --> 18:45.060
So thank you for giving it.

18:45.060 --> 18:48.220
So I'm not a designer, but I'm a social scientist.

18:48.220 --> 18:53.900
And I really like this idea of toolkits because methodologically in the social science we

18:53.900 --> 18:59.580
do oftentimes a lot of things that research-focused designers do.

18:59.580 --> 19:05.140
And so in my experience, when finding the correct tools to do things, it's like within

19:05.140 --> 19:09.420
the social science, you've got to read a book, someone published a book 20 years ago, and

19:09.420 --> 19:12.180
it's got some ideas in there.

19:12.180 --> 19:16.700
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you got this community

19:16.700 --> 19:22.580
together to put together, decide what tools go into the toolkit.

19:22.580 --> 19:23.580
How did you do that outreach?

19:23.580 --> 19:24.580
And I know you spoke a little bit.

19:24.580 --> 19:30.580
I'm voting on various things, but I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more detail.

19:30.580 --> 19:31.980
Yeah, absolutely.

19:31.980 --> 19:35.580
So as I mentioned, when I started creating, and feel free to stop me when the time is

19:35.580 --> 19:36.580
up.

19:36.580 --> 19:40.260
But as I mentioned, I basically, when I started, I started really umbrella and I started just

19:40.260 --> 19:45.020
thinking, oh, I'll just start creating tools for all the different UX research tools that

19:45.020 --> 19:46.500
I know about.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.020
Basically we at the community, we have calls.

19:49.020 --> 19:53.460
The calls are all open for everyone to watch on YouTube.

19:53.460 --> 19:57.660
Probably if you go on YouTube, you type in UX research calls, Bitcoin design community,

19:57.660 --> 19:59.760
you'll find the call where we voted.

19:59.760 --> 20:06.460
So we basically had four UX researchers, everyone from different backgrounds.

20:06.460 --> 20:13.020
First we opened up with a conversation of, hey, how do we split the toolkit?

20:13.020 --> 20:15.100
What would be the most sensical way of splitting the toolkit?

20:15.100 --> 20:16.880
That was the question number one.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.760
Then we decided on the two areas.

20:19.760 --> 20:26.020
And then question number two was, in your experience, what has worked the best with

20:26.020 --> 20:30.460
understanding and gaining insights at this phase of the product?

20:30.460 --> 20:34.680
What helps to understand and get insights at that phase of the product?

20:34.680 --> 20:35.860
And then we just jammed.

20:35.860 --> 20:41.260
Like everyone was, we wrote, we made a few sticky notes and then we voted literally with

20:41.260 --> 20:46.520
smiley faces and we didn't even share, there were no names attached to smiley faces.

20:46.520 --> 20:50.540
So it was really open and transparent.

20:50.540 --> 20:56.940
And yeah, I mean, if there's any UX researchers in this room, I openly invite you, and I know

20:56.940 --> 21:01.620
there's already one in this room, I openly invite you to come work on the UX research

21:01.620 --> 21:05.900
toolkit because it's completely open for everyone.

21:05.900 --> 21:10.840
I want more minds and more insights on it because I believe we can only build better

21:10.840 --> 21:13.060
products if we build together.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.300
And that's the Slack channel.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.180
Yeah, you can find me on Twitter.

21:17.180 --> 21:22.180
If you reach out to me on Twitter, I'll direct you to the Slack channel and we can, yeah.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.180
Thanks for the great presentation.

21:23.180 --> 21:29.180
I'm really curious now that you're working on this research toolkit and you want to take

21:29.180 --> 21:31.180
it somewhere, what is the next step?

21:31.180 --> 21:34.180
How do you make sure that the people that you want to reach for this can actually start

21:34.180 --> 21:35.180
using it?

21:35.180 --> 21:36.380
I already have an idea about that.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.900
I love that question.

21:37.900 --> 21:43.620
So my next dream, and I think I have to stop now and I'll wrap it up very quickly, is that

21:43.620 --> 21:47.780
my next goal is once the toolkit's built out, I'm going to reach out to all the open source

21:47.780 --> 21:48.780
projects.

21:48.780 --> 21:51.660
I'm going to go knocking at everyone's door and say, hey, can you come help me test out

21:51.660 --> 21:52.660
this toolkit?

21:52.660 --> 21:53.660
Can we run it through?

21:53.660 --> 21:55.820
Can we do a bit of a sprint in your project?

21:55.820 --> 22:00.940
And then I'd like to get feedback from them and see how they experience it, and then build

22:00.940 --> 22:05.740
case studies out of that feedback and then show other projects like, hey, Bitcoin Core

22:05.740 --> 22:06.740
used the toolkit.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.460
Look, this is how it worked for them.

22:08.460 --> 22:14.260
This is the case study, and then use that as a way to basically move forward.

22:14.260 --> 22:15.260
Cool.

22:15.260 --> 22:38.740
Thank you, everyone.
