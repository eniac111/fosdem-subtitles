0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.400
Hello everyone, glad to be here. I am Etienne Combe, I am a researcher at Guast-Avester

2
0:00:12.400 --> 0:00:19.640
University and I will talk about a site project that I have from several times ago and try

3
0:00:19.640 --> 0:00:27.240
to tell the story of this site project with concern of web mapping and statistical data

4
0:00:27.240 --> 0:00:36.800
and how quickly, how the OpenStreetMap stack have changed the way we show and diffuse statistical

5
0:00:36.800 --> 0:00:44.400
data. Okay, so this is a background that I will skip and I will go back in time eight

6
0:00:44.400 --> 0:00:52.520
years ago. I was on a project and I was working on a massive, great statistical data set that

7
0:00:52.520 --> 0:01:01.760
are called Doné-Caroé in French and these data are derived from text sheets and they

8
0:01:01.760 --> 0:01:10.960
are given at a very detailed spatial scale, so pixels of 200 meters by 200 meters on all

9
0:01:10.960 --> 0:01:21.360
the French territories and you have several variables like population structures, number

10
0:01:21.360 --> 0:01:30.440
of people under 10, above 17 and so on and you have also information about the revenue

11
0:01:30.440 --> 0:01:38.880
of the people and this data set reached the statistical limit of statistical secret, so

12
0:01:38.880 --> 0:01:45.520
in some of the pixels there are less than 11 households, so the data are aggregated

13
0:01:45.520 --> 0:01:52.400
in order to be above this threshold which is forced by the law. So the more precise

14
0:01:52.400 --> 0:02:02.600
data set that we may have on the French population. Okay, and the distribution of this data set

15
0:02:02.600 --> 0:02:10.960
at this time was like this, so the first step was to go on the INSE website, find this page,

16
0:02:10.960 --> 0:02:19.360
it was already quite hard because it was in a very deep part of the website and you have

17
0:02:19.360 --> 0:02:27.080
to download two files in a very specific file format like DBF and MIFF-MID which were coming

18
0:02:27.080 --> 0:02:35.800
from a map for software, so a G software from the 80s and you have to deal with that. Okay,

19
0:02:35.800 --> 0:02:45.200
so not very easy, you already have a QG way to read that, so there is already an open

20
0:02:45.200 --> 0:02:53.120
source software to read the data but the exploration was not very easy and friendly. Okay, so this

21
0:02:53.120 --> 0:03:03.800
is the help page to read the data, load them in QGs and so on but if you are not a G specialist,

22
0:03:03.800 --> 0:03:12.120
it was quite difficult to deal with that. Okay, and I was working with my student on

23
0:03:12.120 --> 0:03:18.080
this data set and at the end of the thesis we had the idea to try to improve a little

24
0:03:18.080 --> 0:03:28.280
bit that and we seen an opportunity. So the context I have already given, EV file, tricky

25
0:03:28.280 --> 0:03:35.400
file format and also projection problem in the data set at this time, usable with a lot

26
0:03:35.400 --> 0:03:44.560
of pain and with dedicated software like Map and Faux, ArcGIS or QGs. And the opportunity

27
0:03:44.560 --> 0:03:50.520
that we have seen at this time was the web mapping stack that was developed around the

28
0:03:50.520 --> 0:04:02.160
OSM project. So OpenLayer was already there, Leaflet also and Mapbox tools were also on

29
0:04:02.160 --> 0:04:12.800
the rise with at this time, this was a tiny platform that allowed to build custom maps,

30
0:04:12.800 --> 0:04:20.440
web maps. Okay, and we had second that this will allow to renew the data diffusion, which

31
0:04:20.440 --> 0:04:29.280
is visualization approaches. Okay, we were not alone, Oliver O'Brien in UK did a quite

32
0:04:29.280 --> 0:04:42.400
similar proposal in 2015 with DataShine, this is a screen of DataShine at this time, which

33
0:04:42.400 --> 0:04:54.400
was built using OpenLayer and he had to build one stack of types for each features he wanted

34
0:04:54.400 --> 0:05:01.680
to be visible on the map. So in all of this interface you may choose between several features,

35
0:05:01.680 --> 0:05:14.800
so more than 50, less than 10, the revenue or so on and he had to build all these types,

36
0:05:14.800 --> 0:05:23.160
so a lot of work. And at the same time there was a technology that was coming which is

37
0:05:23.160 --> 0:05:29.160
called vector ties, so the ties that were used to build the map are no more images but

38
0:05:29.160 --> 0:05:42.520
are vector file format solutions, so it was the very beginning of this approach and I

39
0:05:42.520 --> 0:05:51.320
have recovered some of the first tech notes about some solutions from the open source

40
0:05:51.320 --> 0:05:58.280
community about vector ties and for statistical data this was a massive advantage because

41
0:05:58.280 --> 0:06:05.440
you may put all the data in the tile and add up the visualization on the front end and

42
0:06:05.440 --> 0:06:11.560
you didn't have to produce one tile set for every feature, so it was very advantageous

43
0:06:11.560 --> 0:06:19.560
and very interesting and we tried to build something around that and the tools were not

44
0:06:19.560 --> 0:06:26.160
existing completely at this time, so the first tool was something like some earth creep to

45
0:06:26.160 --> 0:06:35.080
process the data and export vector ties in geo-gizom format, a leaflet map to draw the

46
0:06:35.080 --> 0:06:43.720
map and a detour hook to render the vector ties on the canvas and to animate all this

47
0:06:43.720 --> 0:06:52.560
and some tricks to try something with interactivity because if you draw something on canvas it's

48
0:06:52.560 --> 0:07:00.720
not so easy to know on which part of the map you are and we tried to put some love in the

49
0:07:00.720 --> 0:07:10.280
details about the color scales, some background on the labels and the data that were produced

50
0:07:10.280 --> 0:07:21.240
by the French administrations were square, so there is one unknown problem with statistical

51
0:07:21.240 --> 0:07:27.840
data, special statistical data which is called the modifiable area unit problem which says

52
0:07:27.840 --> 0:07:33.760
that when you change the elevation levels you will see different things and you may

53
0:07:33.760 --> 0:07:44.520
find different patterns and we see that this can be an opportunity in fact and we will

54
0:07:44.520 --> 0:07:49.160
try to aggregate the raw data at different scales and link these scales with the zoom

55
0:07:49.160 --> 0:07:55.520
levels, so this will solve two problems, we need to keep the vector ties a little bit

56
0:07:55.520 --> 0:08:04.640
small because we are on the web so we did not want to download 10 mega and so on, so

57
0:08:04.640 --> 0:08:12.440
this will be solved by the aggregations and because of the map we want to explore several

58
0:08:12.440 --> 0:08:20.520
aggregations scales so this was a possibility that were interesting, so this first solution

59
0:08:20.520 --> 0:08:37.480
is still usable eight years ago and it's already cool, so you have a map you may zoom, you

60
0:08:37.480 --> 0:08:45.680
may look for a place and so on and you may find a precise location, you may switch the

61
0:08:45.680 --> 0:08:51.520
features that you want to look at and you didn't have to download the big file open

62
0:08:51.520 --> 0:08:57.760
energy software and it's quite more easy.

63
0:08:57.760 --> 0:09:07.920
Okay so this was the first project and we get some feedback from the INSE so we are

64
0:09:07.920 --> 0:09:14.760
speaking with the producer of the data, also from journalists, some journalists were interested

65
0:09:14.760 --> 0:09:21.480
on specific topics and used the tools for example to study segregation on school or

66
0:09:21.480 --> 0:09:28.960
districting, your banists also use some of the your banists use that for territorial

67
0:09:28.960 --> 0:09:38.760
diagnosis, transportation research and curious people so it was cool and since this first

68
0:09:38.760 --> 0:09:54.400
version the technology has quite matured and there is now a very standard way to deliver

69
0:09:54.400 --> 0:10:03.280
vector types which is an NVTA format, Mapbox vector types with specifications and Pojis,

70
0:10:03.280 --> 0:10:10.160
all known database can produce these type of vector types and there is also new frontend

71
0:10:10.160 --> 0:10:17.720
solutions like Mapbox gel which is now a normal and open source but the open source project

72
0:10:17.720 --> 0:10:29.360
is used by MapTrib now and that's also, we have a new tool chain and some successors

73
0:10:29.360 --> 0:10:37.120
and if you have questions and if you want details about some of these successors it

74
0:10:37.120 --> 0:10:39.120
will be a pleasure.

75
0:10:39.120 --> 0:10:55.120
Excuse me but I am completely disconnected from one point, vector types in French what

76
0:10:55.120 --> 0:10:57.120
is the translation?

77
0:10:57.120 --> 0:11:08.320
It's how you split so the question was about vector types and the meaning of vector types

78
0:11:08.320 --> 0:11:17.800
so when mapping is based on a pyramid of types and when you zoom, a type is a tool in French.

79
0:11:17.800 --> 0:11:37.520
Yes but it's because in web mapping, so to draw the map you have to build tiles that

80
0:11:37.520 --> 0:11:44.600
are 100 in a pyramid and when you zoom you download only the parts of the zoom level

81
0:11:44.600 --> 0:11:57.480
that is concerned by the current view so it's to optimize the usage of the bandwidth and

82
0:11:57.480 --> 0:12:03.880
to send only the relevant part of the data to the frontend during the exploration of

83
0:12:03.880 --> 0:12:25.760
the map.

84
0:12:25.760 --> 0:12:40.960
From Inse they are trying to build something similar but from some time now and it's still

85
0:12:40.960 --> 0:12:50.520
not online so I have worked on a prototype for them so the next version of the solution

86
0:12:50.520 --> 0:13:09.120
was built with Inse and the didn't have sufficiently people inside to deal with this type of project

87
0:13:09.120 --> 0:13:16.200
I think but it's still not there but if you look at that I shine so almost the same project

88
0:13:16.200 --> 0:13:26.360
with similar tools and in the UK that I shine is now available in for the census of the

89
0:13:26.360 --> 0:13:31.560
UK it's a new version of that I shine that is used.

90
0:13:31.560 --> 0:13:39.680
So I have some hope that at one point in time we will have an official portal in Inse that

91
0:13:39.680 --> 0:13:52.800
will look like that but still not.

92
0:13:52.800 --> 0:14:03.040
Yes but not in the web mapping exploration tools for everybody but I had one version

93
0:14:03.040 --> 0:14:12.600
for your buddies for example where they can upload their own shape files to add more layers

94
0:14:12.600 --> 0:14:15.200
of information.

95
0:14:15.200 --> 0:14:31.280
Yes there is a European initiative I have forgotten the name but it's all derived from

96
0:14:31.280 --> 0:14:39.040
the Inspear directive which gives some guidelines for delivering statistical data, special statistical

97
0:14:39.040 --> 0:14:53.200
data sets and there is also a library from Eurostat which is called GrideViz.

98
0:14:53.200 --> 0:14:58.520
You may find the links but there is a JavaScript library now which is developed by Eurostat

99
0:14:58.520 --> 0:15:02.560
to show grided data, statistical data.

100
0:15:02.560 --> 0:15:03.560
Thank you, we have to get here.

101
0:15:03.560 --> 0:15:28.880
Thank you.
