0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:14.180
Okay, hi everyone. Thank you for being here and thank you for the invitation. I'm going

2
0:00:14.180 --> 0:00:21.860
to speak maybe in a less technical way, in more realistic way of the thing I am trying

3
0:00:21.860 --> 0:00:27.840
to do for the last year. I'm Ã‰mio Anschulze. I'm a postdoctoral researcher in sociology

4
0:00:27.840 --> 0:00:36.680
of science and health in France, both in Medialab and in the SES team in Marseille. I'm going

5
0:00:36.680 --> 0:00:41.560
to say something about the way we are doing scientific programming in Python in social

6
0:00:41.560 --> 0:00:49.160
sciences and the way we can improve it. I gave this presentation a provocative title

7
0:00:49.160 --> 0:00:55.620
that is so wide to speak about what are the specifics of social sciences and how can we

8
0:00:55.620 --> 0:01:01.400
improve all this kind of environment, make computing and data analysis in relation directly

9
0:01:01.400 --> 0:01:09.940
to open science. So, yes, it's kind of humble presentation. If I want to summary it in one

10
0:01:09.940 --> 0:01:16.160
sentence, my point is to say that social sciences need more scientific programming. And it is

11
0:01:16.160 --> 0:01:21.960
three points. First, that scientific programming has, I think, the right flexibility to equip

12
0:01:21.960 --> 0:01:27.400
the very diverse practices that exist right now in social sciences. For the moment, we

13
0:01:27.400 --> 0:01:32.560
have the landscape, especially in France, with main based on the air language and Python

14
0:01:32.560 --> 0:01:39.600
could benefit of some impulse and I think he needs it. And the gateway will be to develop

15
0:01:39.600 --> 0:01:44.960
very specific disciplinary packages that are still missing for Python in social sciences,

16
0:01:44.960 --> 0:01:52.480
which I can call disciplinary API for the language and to move beyond open source treatment.

17
0:01:52.480 --> 0:01:57.960
So, just a quick disclosure. I've been trained physics, but I moved in sociology and now

18
0:01:57.960 --> 0:02:02.480
I'm speaking as sociologist or social scientist here. I'm trying to give some feedback of

19
0:02:02.480 --> 0:02:07.400
what we are using in our community and I'm trying to answer two questions in one which

20
0:02:07.400 --> 0:02:14.360
are not very well delineated, which is first, how to improve Python in social sciences and

21
0:02:14.360 --> 0:02:18.880
in a more general way, what are the different uses of scientific programming right now because

22
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:23.320
we don't have a very clear look of what's going on in all the different ways we can

23
0:02:23.320 --> 0:02:29.320
use scientific programming. So, it's a work in progress, so it's mainly to make an exchange

24
0:02:29.320 --> 0:02:35.080
with you. To be clear about my title, I'm not saying that we are under equipped in a

25
0:02:35.080 --> 0:02:40.840
pejorative way. Social sciences have a well established open source software platform

26
0:02:40.840 --> 0:02:45.240
and some of them are going to be presented today and usually give a warm welcome to new

27
0:02:45.240 --> 0:02:50.480
strategies for data analysis and its own field work are expanding to numeric and software

28
0:02:50.480 --> 0:02:59.240
data. So, we are using and studying all those software tools and open source tools, but

29
0:02:59.240 --> 0:03:06.400
it is a general point of view from sociologists. We have in general a low tech practice and

30
0:03:06.400 --> 0:03:13.560
we are using software applications programming for very discrete, meaning punctual or kind

31
0:03:13.560 --> 0:03:17.840
of unseen operations and if you want to have a look, there is a very nice article from

32
0:03:17.840 --> 0:03:22.960
Caroline Muller, Fredrik Laver, about how historians are changing their practices and

33
0:03:22.960 --> 0:03:27.760
putting some more numerical analysis inside their work, but still conserving the global

34
0:03:27.760 --> 0:03:35.200
way of doing their work. So, we need flexibility to adapt to individualized practices or topics

35
0:03:35.200 --> 0:03:40.000
which are very personal to research. So, I need to say a word about the specificity

36
0:03:40.000 --> 0:03:45.200
of social sciences because I don't think we are very numerous today. There are a variety

37
0:03:45.200 --> 0:03:52.800
of disciplines, this very different way of dealing with data and analyzing archives and

38
0:03:52.800 --> 0:03:59.680
interviews and within each disciplines there is a huge variety of methodologies, school

39
0:03:59.680 --> 0:04:05.360
of arts, theoretical approaches and from an organizational point of view there is a very

40
0:04:05.360 --> 0:04:11.040
weak functional dependency between all the researchers in our different fields and moreover

41
0:04:11.040 --> 0:04:18.200
there are very important national specificities and moreover each research, each research

42
0:04:18.200 --> 0:04:24.440
trend is very conceptually laden, meaning that there is very important given to the

43
0:04:24.440 --> 0:04:30.600
trend that each researcher is using to collect data and to analyzing it. There are no global

44
0:04:30.600 --> 0:04:38.640
rules of how to do it. So, there is a very huge limit of one size fits all instruments

45
0:04:38.640 --> 0:04:45.400
in our disciplines and besides there are very harsh critics against standardization and

46
0:04:45.400 --> 0:04:50.960
normalization because it is seen as a way to erase plurality which is some kind of base

47
0:04:50.960 --> 0:04:56.120
of what are social sciences. So, there is a huge fight between individualization and

48
0:04:56.120 --> 0:05:02.200
standardization of practices. Nevertheless, shared instruments are important especially

49
0:05:02.200 --> 0:05:08.760
software instruments and science studies which is a field of sociology and topology of science

50
0:05:08.760 --> 0:05:14.480
are shown the crucial role of instruments for the functioning of scientific communities.

51
0:05:14.480 --> 0:05:18.880
It is very important for conceptual changes because it allows us to look at other stuff

52
0:05:18.880 --> 0:05:22.840
at different scales, at different topology like the microscopes change the way we are

53
0:05:22.840 --> 0:05:27.560
doing biology. They are very important for disciplinary identity, the way we present

54
0:05:27.560 --> 0:05:32.240
ourselves in our research communities and how we define our activity and they are very

55
0:05:32.240 --> 0:05:39.680
important for coordination between specialties and standardization of practices beyond a

56
0:05:39.680 --> 0:05:46.880
small group of researchers and to transfer surgical agencies and meteorological changes.

57
0:05:46.880 --> 0:05:51.520
And there is a lot of studies about how electron microscopes change biophysics has to put second

58
0:05:51.520 --> 0:05:57.240
cell for change medicines and the way we are dealing with data but there are very few studies

59
0:05:57.240 --> 0:06:03.600
on the way software is changing and standardizing practices especially for social sciences.

60
0:06:03.600 --> 0:06:09.200
That has a value, social sciences are kind of divided regarding standardization especially

61
0:06:09.200 --> 0:06:14.120
imposed standardization because it usually reflects some kind of relationship or one

62
0:06:14.120 --> 0:06:19.600
specific kind of thought which try to impose its way of doing things against others especially

63
0:06:19.600 --> 0:06:26.680
in sociology or political sciences. So there is a goal of to define what is a good scale

64
0:06:26.680 --> 0:06:33.520
of creating software instruments for social sciences. Scientific programming is what I

65
0:06:33.520 --> 0:06:39.680
want to say today is a solution which both favor new, the Raman new scientific instruments

66
0:06:39.680 --> 0:06:44.440
within the specialties and to improve some kind of second hard generation standardization

67
0:06:44.440 --> 0:06:50.080
by using the same way of doing scientific programming and it's a good entry point for

68
0:06:50.080 --> 0:06:55.800
new open source practices which are not existing or very little existing within social sciences

69
0:06:55.800 --> 0:07:04.560
like those linked to as we've just seen other open science, reproducibility and collaboration

70
0:07:04.560 --> 0:07:11.560
beyond the small disciplines which compose social sciences and to import new cool stuff

71
0:07:11.560 --> 0:07:16.760
like coming from the computer science, AI stuff and machine learning. Nevertheless for

72
0:07:16.760 --> 0:07:23.560
the moment scientific programming as a global frame is not very common in social sciences.

73
0:07:23.560 --> 0:07:28.560
Of course there are always cool kids so there are people doing it and computational social

74
0:07:28.560 --> 0:07:37.280
sciences are the thing and expand very quickly in our field but for the common people it

75
0:07:37.280 --> 0:07:43.600
is not very developed and we have a lot of users of air which has an intermediate status

76
0:07:43.600 --> 0:07:49.720
between a programming language and a statistical language which kind of dual status. What I

77
0:07:49.720 --> 0:07:55.960
mean as scientific programming so very quick but it's a diversity of practices they have

78
0:07:55.960 --> 0:08:01.560
in common the fact that it's interactivity, exploratory and based on packages and the

79
0:08:01.560 --> 0:08:05.960
priority is given to usefulness for researchers to explore certain questions they want to

80
0:08:05.960 --> 0:08:12.840
address and all the questions just we have seen are not the primary aim of the researchers

81
0:08:12.840 --> 0:08:17.880
who are using scientific programming so stability, design and also very important question of

82
0:08:17.880 --> 0:08:23.840
software development are not what is in the first front of the uses of scientific programming

83
0:08:23.840 --> 0:08:28.400
but when you are looking at what researchers are doing, they are doing different one of

84
0:08:28.400 --> 0:08:34.840
the steps of the different scale and they are not all of them developing and creating

85
0:08:34.840 --> 0:08:43.520
new packages so the diversity of practices were existing. If you look on what are currently

86
0:08:43.520 --> 0:08:51.360
the software uses for researchers in social sciences so it's a kind of a exploratory mapping

87
0:08:51.360 --> 0:08:59.280
because it comes from non-representative survey conducted by Mariana Iglebechik in France

88
0:08:59.280 --> 0:09:05.080
in a study called State of Open Science Practices in France and we ask for researchers in different

89
0:09:05.080 --> 0:09:10.760
field what kind of tools are using their research and they can answer different for producing

90
0:09:10.760 --> 0:09:16.360
data, analyzing data so just a small network of all the tools that researchers are saying

91
0:09:16.360 --> 0:09:24.600
they are using for social sciences and humanities also and if you look to this huge diversity

92
0:09:24.600 --> 0:09:31.240
what just the main result as there is a diversity of software and profile of researchers nothing

93
0:09:31.240 --> 0:09:38.480
new about that you will find the centrality of standard office software like Word, Calc,

94
0:09:38.480 --> 0:09:51.480
LibreOffice etc. and the main scientific programming language used is air with 22% of users that

95
0:09:51.480 --> 0:09:59.280
are using it and then a geographical software QG 10% for SPSS which is a statistical software

96
0:09:59.280 --> 0:10:06.480
and only 6% using Python in this broad field of social science community and if you look

97
0:10:06.480 --> 0:10:11.840
just to the quotation the reality of the work is usually just using at some point some software

98
0:10:11.840 --> 0:10:22.800
and there is no global glue of open source tools in the workflow of the researchers. So even when

99
0:10:22.800 --> 0:10:28.880
you look at the small part of the social scientist who are doing quantitative analysis so it's a sub

100
0:10:28.880 --> 0:10:36.840
part of it there are also a huge diversity, diverse tools, divisions so we are looking to a very

101
0:10:36.840 --> 0:10:47.480
very fragmented communities and there is a need to create some glue between them. What you can say

102
0:10:47.480 --> 0:10:54.440
that 22% of researchers once saw the survey said they are using air as a statistical and scientific

103
0:10:54.440 --> 0:10:59.280
programming language and the observation is important because air developed for good reason

104
0:10:59.280 --> 0:11:04.800
for social sciences. It developed because there is an afflicted affinity between the diversity

105
0:11:04.800 --> 0:11:10.000
of practices existing and the flexibility of the tools that air allows that allows to develop very

106
0:11:10.000 --> 0:11:19.460
specific packages which can continue the work of small communities. You probably all know about

107
0:11:19.460 --> 0:11:25.520
air, it's a script-oriented language. You can build very quickly small packages with data about a

108
0:11:25.520 --> 0:11:31.760
specific research project and there is a lot of support from the French community with there is a

109
0:11:31.760 --> 0:11:40.520
lot of packages in French for instance. But this leads to limits. It creates a huge diversity of

110
0:11:40.520 --> 0:11:47.060
types of package. Some of them are not very easy to understand. Some of them are not very well

111
0:11:47.060 --> 0:11:53.120
documented and there are functions that exist only in air which creates some kind of, we increase

112
0:11:53.120 --> 0:11:59.000
the diversity of tools social sciences community are using. Depending on what packages you look

113
0:11:59.000 --> 0:12:04.720
like there is a very low documentation and very low standardization of the code and there is still

114
0:12:04.720 --> 0:12:08.660
this ambiguity between what is the statistical languages and what is the programming language.

115
0:12:08.660 --> 0:12:17.880
For the main topic of what I want to say, what is the state of the Python uses in social sciences?

116
0:12:17.880 --> 0:12:23.060
Let's say there are not a lot of people using it. There are more and more human researchers

117
0:12:23.060 --> 0:12:28.120
interested to leverage machine learning in their research. So they are coming to Python to try to

118
0:12:28.120 --> 0:12:35.000
understand how they can use it in their research. But for the moment it's difficult to get to realize

119
0:12:35.000 --> 0:12:41.920
the basic steps of social scientists work in Python. So it means all the tools that we are using

120
0:12:41.920 --> 0:12:50.240
on a daily basis like making logistic regression with a clear presentation of the results. And we

121
0:12:50.240 --> 0:12:55.840
need what I want to say, dedicated community packages as a middle ground for researchers to

122
0:12:55.840 --> 0:13:02.480
access friendship programming and then being perceived aware of all the open source and open

123
0:13:02.480 --> 0:13:08.800
science practices they can add in their research. So for that there is a need to go beyond application

124
0:13:08.800 --> 0:13:14.280
development itself and beyond one specific package. It's a whole process to implement.

125
0:13:14.280 --> 0:13:22.520
Just what are the expected positive benefits of Python broad adoption? Just a small snippet. It

126
0:13:22.520 --> 0:13:27.920
will enhance scientific programming practices especially with the importation of the whole

127
0:13:27.920 --> 0:13:35.320
ecosystem of Python, especially notebooks. They have the potential flexibility and they will allow

128
0:13:35.320 --> 0:13:42.480
to create common language with other communities especially computer sciences. The question is

129
0:13:42.480 --> 0:13:49.000
still we in the social sciences have already aired as a main language. What's the future of

130
0:13:49.000 --> 0:13:55.400
the collaboration between the student language? Reject the idea to develop Python to advocate

131
0:13:55.400 --> 0:14:06.520
the polyglotism between and Python or start a transition with Python. In France we decided to

132
0:14:06.520 --> 0:14:12.760
teach Python as a first language for students in high school. So maybe there is a change going on

133
0:14:12.760 --> 0:14:18.320
on what kind of languages students are going to practice in the future. So it creates a shared

134
0:14:18.320 --> 0:14:26.600
language. It's a leap of faith to decide what kind of tools we will need. Mine here is the Python but

135
0:14:26.600 --> 0:14:32.560
I'm here to speak about the place of a central programming. So both of them are going to be

136
0:14:32.560 --> 0:14:38.600
together. I just want to say a word about what I'm trying to do in France for social sciences,

137
0:14:38.600 --> 0:14:45.720
especially in sociology, to enable this practice of Python and this kind of by social humanities

138
0:14:45.720 --> 0:14:52.520
social and science package. I need to achieve a double constraint first to achieve some

139
0:14:52.520 --> 0:14:58.240
standardization because we need some shared tools to be able to work together especially to train

140
0:14:58.240 --> 0:15:04.960
students and to create collaboration projects. But we can't sacrifice our disciplinary and

141
0:15:04.960 --> 0:15:11.440
subdisciplinary specificities so we need to find the good level of flexibility. It's a four-step

142
0:15:11.440 --> 0:15:17.560
process. Nothing very new and it's very common I guess in every development of packages and tools.

143
0:15:17.560 --> 0:15:24.120
The first one is to identify what kind of practices can be called co-assist standard even

144
0:15:24.120 --> 0:15:29.120
if they are not completely standard. The second step is to build easy to use packages. I can

145
0:15:29.120 --> 0:15:34.160
find place in the specific workflow. The third one is to prove it can be useful because there

146
0:15:34.160 --> 0:15:40.840
is no way to create something. There is no proof that it makes some positive advantage in research

147
0:15:40.840 --> 0:15:47.000
processes and then the first step is to train colleagues and develop practices. Step one, to

148
0:15:47.000 --> 0:15:53.160
uncover standard practices and we need to and I'm speaking about social science to understand better

149
0:15:53.160 --> 0:15:59.840
what is a common sense of our daily job. For instance not all social scientists are doing

150
0:15:59.840 --> 0:16:07.640
machine learning or statistics but a lot of them still do it a bit especially basic statistics.

151
0:16:07.640 --> 0:16:13.960
So there are some co-assist standard operations for instance for survey, analyzing surveys with

152
0:16:13.960 --> 0:16:22.160
questionnaire and samples. So we need more like descriptive statistics for survey, different

153
0:16:22.160 --> 0:16:30.000
tools for transformation of file formats to generate and modify tables to create

154
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:37.840
intermediate documents and to produce visualizations the way we use it in our work. For instance,

155
0:16:37.840 --> 0:16:45.320
France we are using a lot of work from Bordeaux, Pierre Bordeaux, sociology and he has very specific

156
0:16:45.320 --> 0:16:52.080
way to present the result of factorial analysis and you can find it in the Python universe. So

157
0:16:52.080 --> 0:16:58.760
you need to start to work with those existing workflow to build more adoption. The second step

158
0:16:58.760 --> 0:17:06.040
is to facilitate the disciplinary use and nitride a small package which is in French and it's the

159
0:17:06.040 --> 0:17:11.720
choice to be able to be close to students and researchers who don't usually use Python to be

160
0:17:11.720 --> 0:17:21.880
a one-liner which is the first step to use some kind of easy tools to move quicker to results close

161
0:17:21.880 --> 0:17:28.440
to the common sense in the way tables are organized and based to facilitate the complete workflow from

162
0:17:28.440 --> 0:17:34.040
the data to some results that can be published or presented to students and it's based on the

163
0:17:34.040 --> 0:17:39.960
basic packages of the Python communities like Bordeaux so it allows to move swiftly from one

164
0:17:39.960 --> 0:17:47.000
specific disciplinary package to the more general practices. The third step is to show the usefulness

165
0:17:47.000 --> 0:17:52.840
of both Python and this specific package and for that there is a need of public demonstration in

166
0:17:52.840 --> 0:17:59.240
context. No research tools can be used will be used if it's not direct advantage to use it for

167
0:17:59.240 --> 0:18:07.880
research and doing stuff. So notebooks are kind of perfect vector to prove and display some,

168
0:18:09.400 --> 0:18:17.800
I can see the figures in this, yes it can be derived polarizing but it's a good way to present

169
0:18:17.800 --> 0:18:23.320
a complete state of research and we developed with the collaboration between Humanoon which is

170
0:18:23.880 --> 0:18:29.640
platform for software and data analysis in French and a cooperative detective ist, five notebooks

171
0:18:29.640 --> 0:18:35.560
for machine learning as a starting point to show how Python can be used like from the beginning to

172
0:18:35.560 --> 0:18:41.240
the end to analyze a survey and the survey we just discussed before about the state of practice

173
0:18:41.240 --> 0:18:48.040
of open source science in France. And the fourth step is a very important step is to train

174
0:18:48.040 --> 0:18:52.520
colleagues and students so you just can put something out there in the world so the tools

175
0:18:52.520 --> 0:18:58.120
need to find the place in research workflow so there is some kind of translation to the tools,

176
0:18:58.120 --> 0:19:05.240
to the practices and we are doing it in different steps, writing books and academic examples

177
0:19:05.240 --> 0:19:11.000
to stabilize a sharp practice in France. I am interviewing laboratories to show how its

178
0:19:11.000 --> 0:19:18.840
usefulness to use some Python even if you don't, my colleagues don't usually do a central programming

179
0:19:19.560 --> 0:19:26.840
to train more new students especially PhD candidates to those new approaches and all the

180
0:19:26.840 --> 0:19:41.400
world around Python like Git and using Git Hub or Git Lab and creating spaces to discuss

181
0:19:41.400 --> 0:19:48.520
our specific practices which for the moment doesn't exist. I will conclude just

182
0:19:48.520 --> 0:19:55.880
from very quick computer ideas. My point today is to say that

183
0:19:56.920 --> 0:20:02.280
central programming especially in Python but not specific in Python is a third way that between

184
0:20:02.280 --> 0:20:09.080
the use of application which is the daily basis of a lot of social sciences especially in sociology

185
0:20:09.080 --> 0:20:15.880
and not using at all code which is also as the daily basis of a lot of qualitative researchers

186
0:20:15.880 --> 0:20:24.280
in social sciences. In scientific programming we allow to promote the productivity and open

187
0:20:24.280 --> 0:20:32.440
source practices because it is the gate to all the practices from the open source communities

188
0:20:32.440 --> 0:20:37.880
and we promote inter-disciplinarity collaboration with colleagues outside the scope of sociology

189
0:20:37.880 --> 0:20:48.600
for instance. Nevertheless, we need to excavate and make this process of understanding what are

190
0:20:48.600 --> 0:20:54.040
standard practices that can be standardized at some point to find early users and creating

191
0:20:54.040 --> 0:21:01.320
code developers that can come along with this work of reflectivity and to demonstrate more

192
0:21:01.320 --> 0:21:09.000
the concrete efficiency of those tools. The limits are the focus on disciplinary specificities

193
0:21:09.000 --> 0:21:15.560
is also drawbacks because it can increase the expression from libraries and it's something

194
0:21:15.560 --> 0:21:21.640
which is real and maybe there are better languages to promote than Python or IR to do that.

195
0:21:21.640 --> 0:21:29.800
But I started with Python. So thank you for listening to me and it's my message.

196
0:21:29.800 --> 0:21:55.800
Thank you. If you could take questions please do repeat the following for the stream. Thanks.

197
0:21:59.800 --> 0:22:11.800
So in recent years we have a lot of conference that one special track for tools and one is

198
0:22:11.800 --> 0:22:30.360
request or kind of a stamp on the paper that the paper is so it comes with a software repository

199
0:22:30.360 --> 0:22:34.360
where you can rerun the experiment. Do you think that will be helpful also to propose

200
0:22:34.360 --> 0:22:38.360
this on social sites? The question is that there is a lot of problems in similar problems

201
0:22:38.360 --> 0:22:45.160
going on in social sciences and even the possibility to make a paper is not here right now in the

202
0:22:45.160 --> 0:22:50.520
social science communities because the logic of central programming is the logic of automatizing

203
0:22:50.520 --> 0:22:58.360
steps and not using directly excel to make that analysis is not yet here in the basic practices

204
0:22:59.240 --> 0:23:04.360
of our communities. Some of my colleagues are doing it but there are very few that are usually

205
0:23:04.360 --> 0:23:11.720
kind of the youngest one. So what I'm saying that is not so clear in what I said is we need to

206
0:23:11.720 --> 0:23:18.280
use more what has been developed from computer sciences and to try to find a way, a gate to

207
0:23:18.280 --> 0:23:23.160
import them at some point in our practices. So to look more what's good to understand what's

208
0:23:23.160 --> 0:23:29.560
going on in computer science we need also a better culture what are all those tools and

209
0:23:29.560 --> 0:23:34.840
it's still not here. Thanks.

210
0:23:34.840 --> 0:23:40.280
So I was trying to set up tutorials

211
0:23:41.480 --> 0:23:46.920
that's important for social science people. This is my presentation actually for those people

212
0:23:46.920 --> 0:23:51.000
who are going to learn these things they're going to learn the new social science. For people who

213
0:23:51.000 --> 0:23:56.120
are not going to learn them not going to learn anything. So this is not very helpful in my own

214
0:23:57.080 --> 0:24:01.400
property architecture experience. Okay a question is that there is a division between people who

215
0:24:01.400 --> 0:24:06.600
wants to train to those tools and those who doesn't want. The fact is we are more and more

216
0:24:06.600 --> 0:24:11.320
working projects in cryptography and the basic culture of what's going on what's possible to do

217
0:24:11.320 --> 0:24:16.440
is something we need to share to everyone. Otherwise our new division which are going to

218
0:24:17.880 --> 0:24:25.160
exist and to reproduce. So I'm quite sure that that's why I've put this kind of very small

219
0:24:25.160 --> 0:24:31.720
diagram first. Semi-programming can start with reading a script and a single language not

220
0:24:31.720 --> 0:24:37.080
policing it by yourself and it is those steps that I think are useful for everyone so global

221
0:24:38.440 --> 0:24:43.640
computer literacy for social scientists even if they don't want to move to other

222
0:24:44.600 --> 0:24:49.560
more advanced tools. But this one is in theory for instance working on project with statisticians

223
0:24:49.560 --> 0:24:55.160
that people were doing scrapping for data to know what is possible to do. Thanks.

224
0:25:19.560 --> 0:25:38.840
You you you speak about the software cap and trees.

225
0:25:49.560 --> 0:25:52.600
They have a section dedicated for social science.

226
0:25:59.800 --> 0:26:05.080
They have a specific context for specific fields like social science and

227
0:26:05.080 --> 0:26:23.000
recently social science and maybe they are totally totally driving everything is open source the workshops material is open and everyone can collaborate with integration at a structure it creates a

228
0:26:25.160 --> 0:26:30.760
yeah a job for you. Yeah of course for the question it is they are already a very

229
0:26:30.760 --> 0:26:36.840
important intensive existing the cap and trees especially in different disciplines. For what I

230
0:26:36.840 --> 0:26:43.160
know in France there are very little visible in social sciences so I use the content they create

231
0:26:43.160 --> 0:26:49.480
they are creating but for what I can see very far from the daily questions social scientists are

232
0:26:50.440 --> 0:26:57.880
having in the daily analysis and there is still you know transition to make and I can I agree

233
0:26:57.880 --> 0:27:04.840
completely with what you said there is a need to make this the jointer but it's a working process

234
0:27:04.840 --> 0:27:10.440
and I will try to contact find someone who wants to do it with me at some point but I've been

235
0:27:10.440 --> 0:27:17.560
trained at some point for software cap and tree but I never completed my training but yes I'm aware of that thank you.

236
0:27:17.560 --> 0:27:44.840
You're right. I have no data about why and sorry for the question the question is how

237
0:27:44.840 --> 0:27:52.360
how much do we know why people are using specific software tools in social sciences. My answer is

238
0:27:52.360 --> 0:28:00.280
and it's with my heart of social scientists interested in science is that I know very little

239
0:28:00.280 --> 0:28:08.760
work studying how researchers are using software and tools there are some work starting to be

240
0:28:08.760 --> 0:28:15.640
developed but I have no answer for instance for air exists because statisticians used it a lot and

241
0:28:15.640 --> 0:28:21.640
so it has been touched in sociological sources and then students became researchers and now

242
0:28:21.640 --> 0:28:28.040
they're using in France so there is an historical past dependency on the specific kind of use but

243
0:28:28.040 --> 0:28:38.040
I'm quite sure it's a huge avenue for research thank you.

244
0:28:58.760 --> 0:29:05.000
I'm quite sure you're right the question is then is how people change

245
0:29:05.800 --> 0:29:09.320
from one software to another and this is the unresolved question so thank you.

246
0:29:09.320 --> 0:29:11.320
Thank you.

247
0:29:40.280 --> 0:29:42.120
Here you go you can put that in your pocket.

248
0:29:42.120 --> 0:30:10.120
Yes wherever you want.
