1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:19.600
Thank you.

2
0:00:19.600 --> 0:00:21.400
So hello, everyone.

3
0:00:21.400 --> 0:00:26.860
We have this talk with lots of nice acronyms.

4
0:00:26.860 --> 0:00:28.040
We hope you enjoy it.

5
0:00:28.040 --> 0:00:35.000
We will talk about accessibility today and about how to make your web applications more

6
0:00:35.000 --> 0:00:43.400
accessible or with some easy tricks and make it accessible to everyone.

7
0:00:43.400 --> 0:00:46.800
And we are Maximilian and I'm Danny.

8
0:00:46.800 --> 0:00:48.080
We are from Deutsche Bahn.

9
0:00:48.080 --> 0:00:50.880
It's a German railway company.

10
0:00:50.880 --> 0:00:57.080
And yeah, we're both working in front ends, working for web applications.

11
0:00:57.080 --> 0:00:58.080
Okay.

12
0:00:58.080 --> 0:01:04.080
So, we want to start with a site from Bill Clinton.

13
0:01:04.080 --> 0:01:09.480
It says congratulations to the launch of the web accessibility initiative, an effort to

14
0:01:09.480 --> 0:01:14.560
ensure that people with disabilities have access to the internet's worldwide web.

15
0:01:14.560 --> 0:01:23.880
And did some of you guess from which year this site is?

16
0:01:23.880 --> 0:01:25.560
I will just give it.

17
0:01:25.560 --> 0:01:32.240
It's from 1997, so accessibility is not a very new topic, a very new thing.

18
0:01:32.240 --> 0:01:35.080
It was still there every time.

19
0:01:35.080 --> 0:01:42.040
And yeah, we want to start a little bit with the awareness of accessibility, why it matters.

20
0:01:42.040 --> 0:01:48.200
Then I will say something to some implementation things and then how you can ensure your application

21
0:01:48.200 --> 0:01:49.200
is accessible.

22
0:01:49.200 --> 0:01:50.200
Great.

23
0:01:50.200 --> 0:01:53.240
Thanks a lot, Danny.

24
0:01:53.240 --> 0:01:57.920
So first of all, accessibility, and we heard the talk by Mike.

25
0:01:57.920 --> 0:02:02.320
It was really amazing to see so much even also regarding Drupal and all of the open

26
0:02:02.320 --> 0:02:06.880
source CMS, for example, the development over there.

27
0:02:06.880 --> 0:02:13.080
But when we talk about accessibility, it's quite easy to say that it's only about a specific

28
0:02:13.080 --> 0:02:15.720
group in the end who would have disabilities.

29
0:02:15.720 --> 0:02:18.120
And even also already said something about it.

30
0:02:18.120 --> 0:02:20.760
It's really about including all the people in there.

31
0:02:20.760 --> 0:02:23.280
This is the main paradigm in the end.

32
0:02:23.280 --> 0:02:27.720
But even also it's us as developers who are bringing in the barriers, who are bringing

33
0:02:27.720 --> 0:02:33.120
in a non-responsive layout in the end, who are bringing in something which doesn't work

34
0:02:33.120 --> 0:02:35.120
under different circumstances.

35
0:02:35.120 --> 0:02:39.960
So this is something that we even also want to dig a little bit more into detail today

36
0:02:39.960 --> 0:02:46.080
and show you some things regarding those aspects.

37
0:02:46.080 --> 0:02:51.440
So you might think of blindness, first of all, but it's about so much more.

38
0:02:51.440 --> 0:02:55.120
It's about permanent disabilities, it's about temporary disabilities, and even also

39
0:02:55.120 --> 0:02:59.360
situational accessibility issues in the end.

40
0:02:59.360 --> 0:03:04.560
There might be, for example, you might be in a situation where you do have probably,

41
0:03:04.560 --> 0:03:11.240
for example, your child on your arm or where you do have only one arm, even also for controlling

42
0:03:11.240 --> 0:03:12.280
your device.

43
0:03:12.280 --> 0:03:14.160
It might be light condition in the end.

44
0:03:14.160 --> 0:03:19.600
There are so many more things than just this one thing that we might think about quite

45
0:03:19.600 --> 0:03:23.200
easily in the very beginning.

46
0:03:23.200 --> 0:03:29.120
To come to the topic why it's even more important is it's a legal topic.

47
0:03:29.120 --> 0:03:34.400
There is the European Accessibility Act, who was enacted in 2019 already.

48
0:03:34.400 --> 0:03:40.240
It needs to be even also transferred to the law in each country in the European Union,

49
0:03:40.240 --> 0:03:41.400
in Germany, for example.

50
0:03:41.400 --> 0:03:49.640
That's even already law since one year now, 2021, two years, sorry, 2021.

51
0:03:49.640 --> 0:03:57.160
But for example, they will only penalize this until the beginning of the year 2025, but

52
0:03:57.160 --> 0:03:58.520
it's similar to GDPR.

53
0:03:58.520 --> 0:04:04.520
We even also, like we waited for a long time and didn't think it through, and so many companies

54
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:10.040
only started to think about and to enact on this topic when it was quite near to the state

55
0:04:10.040 --> 0:04:15.560
in 2019 with GDPR.

56
0:04:15.560 --> 0:04:20.640
To clarify things up a little bit about the structure, how it's being managed, how especially

57
0:04:20.640 --> 0:04:24.640
for the web, and we're mainly talking about the web, there's obviously also accessibility

58
0:04:24.640 --> 0:04:29.440
regarding applications about native development.

59
0:04:29.440 --> 0:04:35.880
The structure is obviously in general, it's W3C, and they do have a web accessibility

60
0:04:35.880 --> 0:04:44.040
initiative, WAI, who's formulating those web content accessibility guidelines.

61
0:04:44.040 --> 0:04:51.840
These are some words that we're also using in our presentation in the end.

62
0:04:51.840 --> 0:04:56.720
All of these rules, all of these principles divide into four categories in the end.

63
0:04:56.720 --> 0:05:03.120
There are, I think, 60 or 70 principles who are divided into those four fields.

64
0:05:03.120 --> 0:05:12.760
It's about perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust criteria that you could test, for

65
0:05:12.760 --> 0:05:18.120
example, your website against, or that you could ensure the compliance of your web pages,

66
0:05:18.120 --> 0:05:21.680
of your website or web application against.

67
0:05:21.680 --> 0:05:25.160
Even also, those play up into three conformance levels.

68
0:05:25.160 --> 0:05:27.120
We've listed them over here.

69
0:05:27.120 --> 0:05:32.880
It's about that A is really the basis, and it should be ensured in all circumstances.

70
0:05:32.880 --> 0:05:37.360
It's, for example, about providing alternative texts in the end for your images.

71
0:05:37.360 --> 0:05:41.400
This is probably quite a simple one.

72
0:05:41.400 --> 0:05:47.000
The other two criteria, this is about really dividing in between, for example, governance,

73
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:55.840
or governmental services in the end, who need to ensure that it's about these AAA criteria

74
0:05:55.840 --> 0:05:58.720
that need to be followed in the end.

75
0:05:58.720 --> 0:06:03.760
For example, for private companies, it's most likely about AA that they need to follow.

76
0:06:03.760 --> 0:06:10.200
All of those criteria are like structures in those conformance levels.

77
0:06:10.200 --> 0:06:13.000
Why is it important in open source projects?

78
0:06:13.000 --> 0:06:16.160
You most likely know this image.

79
0:06:16.160 --> 0:06:22.080
It's always used in the context of security, for example, but it's even also similar.

80
0:06:22.080 --> 0:06:26.400
I mean, accessibility, it's even also some kind of a quality attribute in the end, which

81
0:06:26.400 --> 0:06:35.880
is underlying and an attribute or something that you could also use for accessibility.

82
0:06:35.880 --> 0:06:42.560
If you do have an inaccessible UI library, for example, or if there's something that

83
0:06:42.560 --> 0:06:49.320
is inaccessible in this UI library, it might lead to problems in so many more projects.

84
0:06:49.320 --> 0:06:54.840
The general paradigm about this is if there's even only one accessibility issue on the website,

85
0:06:54.840 --> 0:06:55.840
it's inaccessible.

86
0:06:55.840 --> 0:06:57.000
It's not about the amount.

87
0:06:57.000 --> 0:06:58.680
It then is inaccessible.

88
0:06:58.680 --> 0:07:00.360
That's very important in the end.

89
0:07:00.360 --> 0:07:06.920
You need to test it and you need to, for ensuring this, it should be accessible.

90
0:07:06.920 --> 0:07:11.200
That's why it's so important even also to test your stuff, but even also to contribute

91
0:07:11.200 --> 0:07:16.480
if you do find something on the Internet to contribute to those libraries.

92
0:07:16.480 --> 0:07:24.320
This might be groundwork for many other websites in the end.

93
0:07:24.320 --> 0:07:29.080
Just one simple commercial about us, about Deutsche Bahn.

94
0:07:29.080 --> 0:07:33.080
We even also do have a design system at Deutsche Bahn.

95
0:07:33.080 --> 0:07:38.480
We obviously, in the very beginning, we started as inner source because it was kind of small

96
0:07:38.480 --> 0:07:39.960
initiative obviously.

97
0:07:39.960 --> 0:07:41.640
You only have some developers.

98
0:07:41.640 --> 0:07:43.600
You have some designers over there.

99
0:07:43.600 --> 0:07:47.280
Then we thought about quite quickly to go open source because from my point of view,

100
0:07:47.280 --> 0:07:51.720
I'm even also doing privately, developing some polyfills and that stuff.

101
0:07:51.720 --> 0:07:54.880
I think open source is one of the paragidings.

102
0:07:54.880 --> 0:07:56.480
It's about learning in public.

103
0:07:56.480 --> 0:07:58.480
Isn't it?

104
0:07:58.480 --> 0:08:00.120
It's going out.

105
0:08:00.120 --> 0:08:01.240
It's talking to each other.

106
0:08:01.240 --> 0:08:06.160
It's about really getting feedback and that stuff.

107
0:08:06.160 --> 0:08:12.720
We decided quite early to go open source and get feedback from the public even also to

108
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:15.400
get that information.

109
0:08:15.400 --> 0:08:19.400
I'll lead over to Danny then for the implementation part.

110
0:08:19.400 --> 0:08:20.720
Thank you.

111
0:08:20.720 --> 0:08:28.400
Now, we want to focus on what's important when implementing an application or an UI

112
0:08:28.400 --> 0:08:29.400
library.

113
0:08:29.400 --> 0:08:31.120
What's the most important thing?

114
0:08:31.120 --> 0:08:37.920
The most important thing, the really most important thing is use semantic HTML.

115
0:08:37.920 --> 0:08:39.520
That's really the most important thing.

116
0:08:39.520 --> 0:08:44.520
I can't say it often.

117
0:08:44.520 --> 0:08:52.880
If you only use diffs, then you make things much more harder to bring in accessibility

118
0:08:52.880 --> 0:08:53.880
later.

119
0:08:53.880 --> 0:08:58.440
To make your application accessible later, it's way harder.

120
0:08:58.440 --> 0:09:04.240
It's easier to change the button style of a button than to bring in accessibility to

121
0:09:04.240 --> 0:09:08.440
a diff element.

122
0:09:08.440 --> 0:09:13.560
A very big thing is that you use landmarks.

123
0:09:13.560 --> 0:09:20.440
Landmarks are used to structure your web page to big elements.

124
0:09:20.440 --> 0:09:25.960
Like a header, like a navigation, a side container, main part.

125
0:09:25.960 --> 0:09:31.440
The landmarks are very important for screen readers to identify where is your structure

126
0:09:31.440 --> 0:09:32.440
of the site.

127
0:09:32.440 --> 0:09:33.480
Where is your navigation?

128
0:09:33.480 --> 0:09:36.680
Where can I switch the sites?

129
0:09:36.680 --> 0:09:38.680
Where is my main content?

130
0:09:38.680 --> 0:09:44.440
This makes it really more easy for users of screen readers to find the content and to

131
0:09:44.440 --> 0:09:49.680
navigate between them.

132
0:09:49.680 --> 0:09:52.200
Another thing is the headlines.

133
0:09:52.200 --> 0:09:56.680
When you use headlines, be sure they are in the right order.

134
0:09:56.680 --> 0:10:04.880
Don't leave out some levels of the headlines or mix the levels.

135
0:10:04.880 --> 0:10:10.160
Just don't make an H1 and after that an H5.

136
0:10:10.160 --> 0:10:12.120
The headlines are like in a book.

137
0:10:12.120 --> 0:10:18.160
If you open a book and you have the index, your web page should be structured like a

138
0:10:18.160 --> 0:10:23.360
book.

139
0:10:23.360 --> 0:10:28.840
Another thing are buttons and links.

140
0:10:28.840 --> 0:10:32.400
People just use buttons and make on-click handlers.

141
0:10:32.400 --> 0:10:35.600
On-click handler will navigate to another page.

142
0:10:35.600 --> 0:10:37.960
Which isn't a good thing.

143
0:10:37.960 --> 0:10:42.520
Please use links to navigate to things and use buttons to do things.

144
0:10:42.520 --> 0:10:44.760
To make actions.

145
0:10:44.760 --> 0:10:46.840
Don't use this.

146
0:10:46.840 --> 0:10:48.840
Never.

147
0:10:48.840 --> 0:11:00.520
Forms are also a great example where accessibility matters a lot.

148
0:11:00.520 --> 0:11:08.920
You have separate elements in the structure of HTML for the label and for the input field.

149
0:11:08.920 --> 0:11:15.320
You should link them together using the ID attribute and the connection.

150
0:11:15.320 --> 0:11:19.240
You also can use area attributes to give another hint.

151
0:11:19.240 --> 0:11:21.960
This is probably the sun.

152
0:11:21.960 --> 0:11:29.240
A great example of accessibility.

153
0:11:29.240 --> 0:11:38.600
You can use descriptions for more hints which are read out by a screen reader to the users

154
0:11:38.600 --> 0:11:49.800
so that the users know the description is linked to this input field of my form.

155
0:11:49.800 --> 0:11:53.480
The ID attribute is also very important.

156
0:11:53.480 --> 0:11:56.640
It's not an art tech by the way.

157
0:11:56.640 --> 0:12:02.040
It's an art attribute.

158
0:12:02.040 --> 0:12:11.320
You should always use an art attribute to describe what's visible on an image.

159
0:12:11.320 --> 0:12:19.320
It's very important that people who can't see an image that they know what it describes.

160
0:12:19.320 --> 0:12:27.040
The only thing when you should use an empty art attribute is when you have just like a

161
0:12:27.040 --> 0:12:29.160
decorative image.

162
0:12:29.160 --> 0:12:35.720
You have a disk icon for a submit button and the submit button already shows it, the text

163
0:12:35.720 --> 0:12:40.920
submit, then it doesn't make sense to have more content.

164
0:12:40.920 --> 0:12:49.080
But otherwise describe your images.

165
0:12:49.080 --> 0:12:52.280
Model dialogues are also a great example.

166
0:12:52.280 --> 0:13:00.760
There are lots of U.I. libraries in the web which are not accessible and lots of U.I.

167
0:13:00.760 --> 0:13:08.320
libraries implement like models from times where the browser didn't support the native

168
0:13:08.320 --> 0:13:10.680
dialogue element.

169
0:13:10.680 --> 0:13:18.840
These libraries have a big issue because when a model appears, sometimes a screen reader

170
0:13:18.840 --> 0:13:26.600
will not notice there's a model and will so it will read out the content behind and that

171
0:13:26.600 --> 0:13:28.240
doesn't make it accessible.

172
0:13:28.240 --> 0:13:29.940
It's not good.

173
0:13:29.940 --> 0:13:35.320
So the native dialogue element is a really good way to use and to make your application

174
0:13:35.320 --> 0:13:41.400
and especially models accessible.

175
0:13:41.400 --> 0:13:46.360
And there are other cool things which are not only good for accessibility issues.

176
0:13:46.360 --> 0:13:50.680
As you can see, this is a detailed summary element in HTML.

177
0:13:50.680 --> 0:13:57.400
And it helps also because if you use like command F or control F on Windows and search

178
0:13:57.400 --> 0:14:05.160
for a term, it will automatically expand and will show where's the content inside the summary.

179
0:14:05.160 --> 0:14:08.200
So, yeah.

180
0:14:08.200 --> 0:14:15.120
That's also a good example for semantic HTML elements.

181
0:14:15.120 --> 0:14:18.840
And there are other things like autocompletion for data lists.

182
0:14:18.840 --> 0:14:24.760
So there are a lot of things that get more and more standardized and available in HTML

183
0:14:24.760 --> 0:14:31.960
5 now and can be used by developers to implement which makes your application more accessible

184
0:14:31.960 --> 0:14:34.640
without using area attributes.

185
0:14:34.640 --> 0:14:45.080
So, area attributes are a way to it's like if you don't find a semantic HTML element,

186
0:14:45.080 --> 0:14:49.040
then you may have to use a div.

187
0:14:49.040 --> 0:14:52.760
And then you can think about do I need some area attribute?

188
0:14:52.760 --> 0:14:59.920
There are some area attributes which helps for making things that aren't natively accessible

189
0:14:59.920 --> 0:15:02.400
that helps to make them accessible.

190
0:15:02.400 --> 0:15:11.720
For example, if you have an area life attribute, it helps to read out if you like notifications

191
0:15:11.720 --> 0:15:18.160
on your site when you get notified from a server or something, a message appears and

192
0:15:18.160 --> 0:15:24.480
you have to find a way to tell the user there was some message occurs.

193
0:15:24.480 --> 0:15:32.640
So there are area life can be used to read it out for screen reader users.

194
0:15:32.640 --> 0:15:35.480
Yeah.

195
0:15:35.480 --> 0:15:42.480
And now may you ask how can I test easily that my application is accessible and I will

196
0:15:42.480 --> 0:15:44.320
turn it over to Maxime.

197
0:15:44.320 --> 0:15:46.320
Thanks, Denny.

198
0:15:46.320 --> 0:15:53.920
So one thing that I'd like to quite quickly add to what you said, think of those HTML

199
0:15:53.920 --> 0:15:58.560
contacts like little microfinance that the browser delivers to the user without the need

200
0:15:58.560 --> 0:15:59.560
for JavaScript.

201
0:15:59.560 --> 0:16:00.560
It's there already.

202
0:16:00.560 --> 0:16:04.720
We do have polyfills for most of these features already.

203
0:16:04.720 --> 0:16:10.640
So use them and by stabilizing this stuff even also through the browser vendors, we

204
0:16:10.640 --> 0:16:16.120
might get better features even also in the future.

205
0:16:16.120 --> 0:16:20.480
Like for example, on mobile devices you might get a different UI, you might get a different

206
0:16:20.480 --> 0:16:24.760
keyboard or even also what we've shown regarding details and summary.

207
0:16:24.760 --> 0:16:30.240
It might be something that the browser vendors then could innovate on and for example bring

208
0:16:30.240 --> 0:16:34.520
in this cool feature regarding site search.

209
0:16:34.520 --> 0:16:35.520
So QA and testing.

210
0:16:35.520 --> 0:16:38.280
We had this question previously regarding testing.

211
0:16:38.280 --> 0:16:43.280
I think one of the easiest things is really to use, let's say easiest things, you do have

212
0:16:43.280 --> 0:16:45.760
the keyboard in front of you most of the time.

213
0:16:45.760 --> 0:16:53.760
So you could use the keyboard, use the tab key to try to navigate in the application

214
0:16:53.760 --> 0:16:59.120
that you're responsible for, that you're working for in the end and try to reach all of the

215
0:16:59.120 --> 0:17:00.880
interactive elements in there.

216
0:17:00.880 --> 0:17:03.520
Try to control the navigation for example.

217
0:17:03.520 --> 0:17:09.080
Try to see whether the focus is existing for example.

218
0:17:09.080 --> 0:17:13.880
There are so many things which are related to keyboard controls even only on the page

219
0:17:13.880 --> 0:17:19.960
where we do assume that the users are using a mouse but this is even also something that

220
0:17:19.960 --> 0:17:23.440
is beneficial for screen readers even also.

221
0:17:23.440 --> 0:17:30.480
It's obviously not something that is the only part, screen readers is even also what Danny

222
0:17:30.480 --> 0:17:35.440
talked about regarding semantic HTML but if you do see that it's not controllable by keyboard

223
0:17:35.440 --> 0:17:41.760
it's most likely even also giving screen reader users a hard time in the end.

224
0:17:41.760 --> 0:17:50.120
And this is the easiest one, Mike talked about some other tools we like to highlight at least

225
0:17:50.120 --> 0:17:54.680
Chrome developer tools so they do have some really nice stuff especially for contrast

226
0:17:54.680 --> 0:17:57.320
ratio for example we wanted to highlight over here.

227
0:17:57.320 --> 0:18:02.720
They do have Google Lighthouse where you could obviously measure so much more stuff but they

228
0:18:02.720 --> 0:18:07.280
do have an accessibility section in there even also giving you great tips in the end

229
0:18:07.280 --> 0:18:13.400
and they even also provide you insights into the accessibility tree which is the basis

230
0:18:13.400 --> 0:18:19.000
for rendering that stuff later on then in the or telling it to the screen reader.

231
0:18:19.000 --> 0:18:24.240
There was a great talk yesterday by Mozilla even also in optimizing this regarding performance

232
0:18:24.240 --> 0:18:29.320
and accessibility performance I would really suggest you to have a look on the recording

233
0:18:29.320 --> 0:18:33.120
for this one.

234
0:18:33.120 --> 0:18:35.660
Another part is the X DevTools.

235
0:18:35.660 --> 0:18:43.240
They do have something for CLI even also they do have plugins for the browsers.

236
0:18:43.240 --> 0:18:47.360
Why have we used the foster website over here?

237
0:18:47.360 --> 0:18:50.240
No hard feelings I'm sorry about it.

238
0:18:50.240 --> 0:18:52.920
Total issues 35.

239
0:18:52.920 --> 0:18:55.720
Let's skip that.

240
0:18:55.720 --> 0:18:57.160
Next slide.

241
0:18:57.160 --> 0:19:02.000
Still it's about the same message it's about the humans test with humans in the end.

242
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:06.160
But it's something which gives you insight quite quickly it's something that is really

243
0:19:06.160 --> 0:19:13.440
low level in the end but talk to colleagues in your company in your field in the end.

244
0:19:13.440 --> 0:19:19.240
I'm even also working with several colleagues with disabilities and it was really inspiring

245
0:19:19.240 --> 0:19:24.080
in the end to see how all of this works and to go through this stuff.

246
0:19:24.080 --> 0:19:28.480
This is something that is really important talk to the users in the end who are using

247
0:19:28.480 --> 0:19:30.680
this.

248
0:19:30.680 --> 0:19:35.520
One of the last things previous to the questions that we wanted to bring up because we talked

249
0:19:35.520 --> 0:19:38.040
about it we had a quick conversation about it.

250
0:19:38.040 --> 0:19:45.360
We do know CVEs for example for a global database regarding security issues.

251
0:19:45.360 --> 0:19:51.200
Why don't we even also do this for accessibility vulnerabilities in the end because it's even

252
0:19:51.200 --> 0:19:56.200
also something that is becoming or that should become more important and that even also becomes

253
0:19:56.200 --> 0:19:57.200
legal.

254
0:19:57.200 --> 0:20:04.560
So why not do something similar for accessibility and we leave you with this.

255
0:20:04.560 --> 0:20:12.320
Thank you very much for your attention and let's go over to your questions now.

256
0:20:12.320 --> 0:20:20.520
Yes please.

257
0:20:20.520 --> 0:20:21.520
I could repeat it.

258
0:20:21.520 --> 0:20:38.560
There are some elements for the date picker.

259
0:20:38.560 --> 0:20:42.600
It depends on the I would say yeah sure sorry I should repeat it.

260
0:20:42.600 --> 0:20:43.800
There are some elements in the end.

261
0:20:43.800 --> 0:20:44.800
Yeah yeah sorry.

262
0:20:44.800 --> 0:20:48.560
There are some elements the question was there are some elements like for example the date

263
0:20:48.560 --> 0:20:53.680
picker which are currently already identified as not being responsible in even the native

264
0:20:53.680 --> 0:20:55.680
browser implementation.

265
0:20:55.680 --> 0:20:59.760
So I think and the question was about whether I do know libraries which I could for example

266
0:20:59.760 --> 0:21:03.280
recommend I think in the end it's depending on the context that you're working in.

267
0:21:03.280 --> 0:21:07.600
So for example if there's a great Angular plugin you couldn't use it in your context

268
0:21:07.600 --> 0:21:12.320
so you always need to sadly do the research and search for a good plugin.

269
0:21:12.320 --> 0:21:18.840
I think and I talked about the standards previously I think it's so important to support those

270
0:21:18.840 --> 0:21:23.760
standards because if we do standardize all of this stuff then the browser vendors do

271
0:21:23.760 --> 0:21:28.640
have the chance even also to make things better in the future.

272
0:21:28.640 --> 0:21:33.760
This is the main point so I couldn't necessarily give a give a perfect suggestion at the moment

273
0:21:33.760 --> 0:21:37.800
but I do know about those issues at least date pickers it's quite hard.

274
0:21:37.800 --> 0:21:44.120
There's another initiative who are trying to even also come up with new solutions because

275
0:21:44.120 --> 0:21:50.320
even also most designers think about that these ugly let's say ugly standard elements

276
0:21:50.320 --> 0:21:56.400
in the browser that they that we need to overlay them because of design reasons and there's

277
0:21:56.400 --> 0:22:00.720
another initiative I don't remember the name who are even already coming up with something

278
0:22:00.720 --> 0:22:07.760
for example for the select menu to build this new but again I'm sorry I could even also

279
0:22:07.760 --> 0:22:13.520
we could add it to the slides afterwards and then it's in the link on the custom website.

280
0:22:13.520 --> 0:22:16.160
Yep thank you.

281
0:22:16.160 --> 0:22:17.160
Any more questions?

282
0:22:17.160 --> 0:22:18.160
Yes please.

283
0:22:18.160 --> 0:22:19.160
Yeah it's you Pablo.

284
0:22:19.160 --> 0:22:20.160
My question here is that by the time a developer has a chance to do that it's been in this space.

285
0:22:20.160 --> 0:22:21.160
At Dogebahn how do you approach this from a design perspective?

286
0:22:21.160 --> 0:22:46.800
Actually I know how to do this in a way that will pass a test.

287
0:22:46.800 --> 0:22:47.800
Yeah.

288
0:22:47.800 --> 0:23:14.360
So I do even also say the question again how do we approach accessibility not in the end

289
0:23:14.360 --> 0:23:20.280
not a testing but even already like for example in the concept phase and design process exactly.

290
0:23:20.280 --> 0:23:25.600
So I think it's mainly about to have this scaling in an organization it's only the first

291
0:23:25.600 --> 0:23:28.800
most important thing is about awareness from my point of view.

292
0:23:28.800 --> 0:23:34.400
So even already in our onboarding sessions for new employees we are having onboarding

293
0:23:34.400 --> 0:23:41.760
sessions we do have talks we do we do educate on accessibility even already.

294
0:23:41.760 --> 0:23:47.360
So I think the main thing is about awareness for all involved people in the end for product

295
0:23:47.360 --> 0:23:51.520
owners for designers for developers for testing in the end.

296
0:23:51.520 --> 0:23:55.440
I think it's mainly about awareness I would say and then you could only scale.

297
0:23:55.440 --> 0:23:59.840
So and I'd like to thank you for your product because we're really looking forward to your

298
0:23:59.840 --> 0:24:02.720
product you talked about thank you.

299
0:24:02.720 --> 0:24:03.720
So another question for.

300
0:24:03.720 --> 0:24:12.360
I'm afraid it's not only about awareness it's also about the right skill set.

301
0:24:12.360 --> 0:24:20.040
We are really struggling to find a talent accessibility talent in the design space.

302
0:24:20.040 --> 0:24:25.520
Awareness is fine but it's also about experience and really challenging projects.

303
0:24:25.520 --> 0:24:30.360
Totally totally it wasn't it wasn't about only aware you haven't said I know you haven't

304
0:24:30.360 --> 0:24:31.360
said it.

305
0:24:31.360 --> 0:24:36.280
It's it's repeated quite quickly it's not about only awareness it's even about the skill

306
0:24:36.280 --> 0:24:39.800
sets it's about experiences but you need to start somewhere.

307
0:24:39.800 --> 0:24:45.440
I mean you could build up experiences by starting and then having all the people getting those

308
0:24:45.440 --> 0:24:46.440
experiences in the end.

309
0:24:46.440 --> 0:24:49.960
I think I couldn't I couldn't have a better answer at least.

310
0:24:49.960 --> 0:24:54.600
We do have several teams who are specifically working on this even also education but even

311
0:24:54.600 --> 0:25:00.160
also testing from the very beginning even already educating concept and designers and

312
0:25:00.160 --> 0:25:02.160
all of these colleagues.

313
0:25:02.160 --> 0:25:07.000
But in the end I think it's yeah it's about skill set awareness and all of this stuff

314
0:25:07.000 --> 0:25:11.320
education talking to each other all of all of that stuff.

315
0:25:11.320 --> 0:25:18.480
This is what I could tell you for the moment but we could follow up.

316
0:25:18.480 --> 0:25:19.480
Time's up okay.

317
0:25:19.480 --> 0:25:25.320
Yeah we are still yeah sorry we are still here if you do have anything else to follow

318
0:25:25.320 --> 0:25:26.320
up.

319
0:25:26.320 --> 0:25:28.080
Yeah just come to us please.

320
0:25:28.080 --> 0:25:35.080
Thank you.
