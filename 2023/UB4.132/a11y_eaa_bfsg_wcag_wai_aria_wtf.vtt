WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.600
Thank you.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.400
So hello, everyone.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.860
We have this talk with lots of nice acronyms.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.040
We hope you enjoy it.

00:28.040 --> 00:35.000
We will talk about accessibility today and about how to make your web applications more

00:35.000 --> 00:43.400
accessible or with some easy tricks and make it accessible to everyone.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.800
And we are Maximilian and I'm Danny.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.080
We are from Deutsche Bahn.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.880
It's a German railway company.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.080
And yeah, we're both working in front ends, working for web applications.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
Okay.

00:58.080 --> 01:04.080
So, we want to start with a site from Bill Clinton.

01:04.080 --> 01:09.480
It says congratulations to the launch of the web accessibility initiative, an effort to

01:09.480 --> 01:14.560
ensure that people with disabilities have access to the internet's worldwide web.

01:14.560 --> 01:23.880
And did some of you guess from which year this site is?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.560
I will just give it.

01:25.560 --> 01:32.240
It's from 1997, so accessibility is not a very new topic, a very new thing.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.080
It was still there every time.

01:35.080 --> 01:42.040
And yeah, we want to start a little bit with the awareness of accessibility, why it matters.

01:42.040 --> 01:48.200
Then I will say something to some implementation things and then how you can ensure your application

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
is accessible.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
Great.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.240
Thanks a lot, Danny.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.920
So first of all, accessibility, and we heard the talk by Mike.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.320
It was really amazing to see so much even also regarding Drupal and all of the open

02:02.320 --> 02:06.880
source CMS, for example, the development over there.

02:06.880 --> 02:13.080
But when we talk about accessibility, it's quite easy to say that it's only about a specific

02:13.080 --> 02:15.720
group in the end who would have disabilities.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.120
And even also already said something about it.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.760
It's really about including all the people in there.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.280
This is the main paradigm in the end.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.720
But even also it's us as developers who are bringing in the barriers, who are bringing

02:27.720 --> 02:33.120
in a non-responsive layout in the end, who are bringing in something which doesn't work

02:33.120 --> 02:35.120
under different circumstances.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.960
So this is something that we even also want to dig a little bit more into detail today

02:39.960 --> 02:46.080
and show you some things regarding those aspects.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.440
So you might think of blindness, first of all, but it's about so much more.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.120
It's about permanent disabilities, it's about temporary disabilities, and even also

02:55.120 --> 02:59.360
situational accessibility issues in the end.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.560
There might be, for example, you might be in a situation where you do have probably,

03:04.560 --> 03:11.240
for example, your child on your arm or where you do have only one arm, even also for controlling

03:11.240 --> 03:12.280
your device.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.160
It might be light condition in the end.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.600
There are so many more things than just this one thing that we might think about quite

03:19.600 --> 03:23.200
easily in the very beginning.

03:23.200 --> 03:29.120
To come to the topic why it's even more important is it's a legal topic.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.400
There is the European Accessibility Act, who was enacted in 2019 already.

03:34.400 --> 03:40.240
It needs to be even also transferred to the law in each country in the European Union,

03:40.240 --> 03:41.400
in Germany, for example.

03:41.400 --> 03:49.640
That's even already law since one year now, 2021, two years, sorry, 2021.

03:49.640 --> 03:57.160
But for example, they will only penalize this until the beginning of the year 2025, but

03:57.160 --> 03:58.520
it's similar to GDPR.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.520
We even also, like we waited for a long time and didn't think it through, and so many companies

04:04.520 --> 04:10.040
only started to think about and to enact on this topic when it was quite near to the state

04:10.040 --> 04:15.560
in 2019 with GDPR.

04:15.560 --> 04:20.640
To clarify things up a little bit about the structure, how it's being managed, how especially

04:20.640 --> 04:24.640
for the web, and we're mainly talking about the web, there's obviously also accessibility

04:24.640 --> 04:29.440
regarding applications about native development.

04:29.440 --> 04:35.880
The structure is obviously in general, it's W3C, and they do have a web accessibility

04:35.880 --> 04:44.040
initiative, WAI, who's formulating those web content accessibility guidelines.

04:44.040 --> 04:51.840
These are some words that we're also using in our presentation in the end.

04:51.840 --> 04:56.720
All of these rules, all of these principles divide into four categories in the end.

04:56.720 --> 05:03.120
There are, I think, 60 or 70 principles who are divided into those four fields.

05:03.120 --> 05:12.760
It's about perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust criteria that you could test, for

05:12.760 --> 05:18.120
example, your website against, or that you could ensure the compliance of your web pages,

05:18.120 --> 05:21.680
of your website or web application against.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.160
Even also, those play up into three conformance levels.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.120
We've listed them over here.

05:27.120 --> 05:32.880
It's about that A is really the basis, and it should be ensured in all circumstances.

05:32.880 --> 05:37.360
It's, for example, about providing alternative texts in the end for your images.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.400
This is probably quite a simple one.

05:41.400 --> 05:47.000
The other two criteria, this is about really dividing in between, for example, governance,

05:47.000 --> 05:55.840
or governmental services in the end, who need to ensure that it's about these AAA criteria

05:55.840 --> 05:58.720
that need to be followed in the end.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.760
For example, for private companies, it's most likely about AA that they need to follow.

06:03.760 --> 06:10.200
All of those criteria are like structures in those conformance levels.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.000
Why is it important in open source projects?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.160
You most likely know this image.

06:16.160 --> 06:22.080
It's always used in the context of security, for example, but it's even also similar.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.400
I mean, accessibility, it's even also some kind of a quality attribute in the end, which

06:26.400 --> 06:35.880
is underlying and an attribute or something that you could also use for accessibility.

06:35.880 --> 06:42.560
If you do have an inaccessible UI library, for example, or if there's something that

06:42.560 --> 06:49.320
is inaccessible in this UI library, it might lead to problems in so many more projects.

06:49.320 --> 06:54.840
The general paradigm about this is if there's even only one accessibility issue on the website,

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
it's inaccessible.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.000
It's not about the amount.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.680
It then is inaccessible.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.360
That's very important in the end.

07:00.360 --> 07:06.920
You need to test it and you need to, for ensuring this, it should be accessible.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.200
That's why it's so important even also to test your stuff, but even also to contribute

07:11.200 --> 07:16.480
if you do find something on the Internet to contribute to those libraries.

07:16.480 --> 07:24.320
This might be groundwork for many other websites in the end.

07:24.320 --> 07:29.080
Just one simple commercial about us, about Deutsche Bahn.

07:29.080 --> 07:33.080
We even also do have a design system at Deutsche Bahn.

07:33.080 --> 07:38.480
We obviously, in the very beginning, we started as inner source because it was kind of small

07:38.480 --> 07:39.960
initiative obviously.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.640
You only have some developers.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.600
You have some designers over there.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.280
Then we thought about quite quickly to go open source because from my point of view,

07:47.280 --> 07:51.720
I'm even also doing privately, developing some polyfills and that stuff.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.880
I think open source is one of the paragidings.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.480
It's about learning in public.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
Isn't it?

07:58.480 --> 08:00.120
It's going out.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.240
It's talking to each other.

08:01.240 --> 08:06.160
It's about really getting feedback and that stuff.

08:06.160 --> 08:12.720
We decided quite early to go open source and get feedback from the public even also to

08:12.720 --> 08:15.400
get that information.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400
I'll lead over to Danny then for the implementation part.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.720
Thank you.

08:20.720 --> 08:28.400
Now, we want to focus on what's important when implementing an application or an UI

08:28.400 --> 08:29.400
library.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.120
What's the most important thing?

08:31.120 --> 08:37.920
The most important thing, the really most important thing is use semantic HTML.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.520
That's really the most important thing.

08:39.520 --> 08:44.520
I can't say it often.

08:44.520 --> 08:52.880
If you only use diffs, then you make things much more harder to bring in accessibility

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
later.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.440
To make your application accessible later, it's way harder.

08:58.440 --> 09:04.240
It's easier to change the button style of a button than to bring in accessibility to

09:04.240 --> 09:08.440
a diff element.

09:08.440 --> 09:13.560
A very big thing is that you use landmarks.

09:13.560 --> 09:20.440
Landmarks are used to structure your web page to big elements.

09:20.440 --> 09:25.960
Like a header, like a navigation, a side container, main part.

09:25.960 --> 09:31.440
The landmarks are very important for screen readers to identify where is your structure

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
of the site.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.480
Where is your navigation?

09:33.480 --> 09:36.680
Where can I switch the sites?

09:36.680 --> 09:38.680
Where is my main content?

09:38.680 --> 09:44.440
This makes it really more easy for users of screen readers to find the content and to

09:44.440 --> 09:49.680
navigate between them.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.200
Another thing is the headlines.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.680
When you use headlines, be sure they are in the right order.

09:56.680 --> 10:04.880
Don't leave out some levels of the headlines or mix the levels.

10:04.880 --> 10:10.160
Just don't make an H1 and after that an H5.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.120
The headlines are like in a book.

10:12.120 --> 10:18.160
If you open a book and you have the index, your web page should be structured like a

10:18.160 --> 10:23.360
book.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.840
Another thing are buttons and links.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.400
People just use buttons and make on-click handlers.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.600
On-click handler will navigate to another page.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.960
Which isn't a good thing.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.520
Please use links to navigate to things and use buttons to do things.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.760
To make actions.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.840
Don't use this.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
Never.

10:48.840 --> 11:00.520
Forms are also a great example where accessibility matters a lot.

11:00.520 --> 11:08.920
You have separate elements in the structure of HTML for the label and for the input field.

11:08.920 --> 11:15.320
You should link them together using the ID attribute and the connection.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.240
You also can use area attributes to give another hint.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.960
This is probably the sun.

11:21.960 --> 11:29.240
A great example of accessibility.

11:29.240 --> 11:38.600
You can use descriptions for more hints which are read out by a screen reader to the users

11:38.600 --> 11:49.800
so that the users know the description is linked to this input field of my form.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.480
The ID attribute is also very important.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.640
It's not an art tech by the way.

11:56.640 --> 12:02.040
It's an art attribute.

12:02.040 --> 12:11.320
You should always use an art attribute to describe what's visible on an image.

12:11.320 --> 12:19.320
It's very important that people who can't see an image that they know what it describes.

12:19.320 --> 12:27.040
The only thing when you should use an empty art attribute is when you have just like a

12:27.040 --> 12:29.160
decorative image.

12:29.160 --> 12:35.720
You have a disk icon for a submit button and the submit button already shows it, the text

12:35.720 --> 12:40.920
submit, then it doesn't make sense to have more content.

12:40.920 --> 12:49.080
But otherwise describe your images.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.280
Model dialogues are also a great example.

12:52.280 --> 13:00.760
There are lots of U.I. libraries in the web which are not accessible and lots of U.I.

13:00.760 --> 13:08.320
libraries implement like models from times where the browser didn't support the native

13:08.320 --> 13:10.680
dialogue element.

13:10.680 --> 13:18.840
These libraries have a big issue because when a model appears, sometimes a screen reader

13:18.840 --> 13:26.600
will not notice there's a model and will so it will read out the content behind and that

13:26.600 --> 13:28.240
doesn't make it accessible.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.940
It's not good.

13:29.940 --> 13:35.320
So the native dialogue element is a really good way to use and to make your application

13:35.320 --> 13:41.400
and especially models accessible.

13:41.400 --> 13:46.360
And there are other cool things which are not only good for accessibility issues.

13:46.360 --> 13:50.680
As you can see, this is a detailed summary element in HTML.

13:50.680 --> 13:57.400
And it helps also because if you use like command F or control F on Windows and search

13:57.400 --> 14:05.160
for a term, it will automatically expand and will show where's the content inside the summary.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.200
So, yeah.

14:08.200 --> 14:15.120
That's also a good example for semantic HTML elements.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.840
And there are other things like autocompletion for data lists.

14:18.840 --> 14:24.760
So there are a lot of things that get more and more standardized and available in HTML

14:24.760 --> 14:31.960
5 now and can be used by developers to implement which makes your application more accessible

14:31.960 --> 14:34.640
without using area attributes.

14:34.640 --> 14:45.080
So, area attributes are a way to it's like if you don't find a semantic HTML element,

14:45.080 --> 14:49.040
then you may have to use a div.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.760
And then you can think about do I need some area attribute?

14:52.760 --> 14:59.920
There are some area attributes which helps for making things that aren't natively accessible

14:59.920 --> 15:02.400
that helps to make them accessible.

15:02.400 --> 15:11.720
For example, if you have an area life attribute, it helps to read out if you like notifications

15:11.720 --> 15:18.160
on your site when you get notified from a server or something, a message appears and

15:18.160 --> 15:24.480
you have to find a way to tell the user there was some message occurs.

15:24.480 --> 15:32.640
So there are area life can be used to read it out for screen reader users.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.480
Yeah.

15:35.480 --> 15:42.480
And now may you ask how can I test easily that my application is accessible and I will

15:42.480 --> 15:44.320
turn it over to Maxime.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
Thanks, Denny.

15:46.320 --> 15:53.920
So one thing that I'd like to quite quickly add to what you said, think of those HTML

15:53.920 --> 15:58.560
contacts like little microfinance that the browser delivers to the user without the need

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
for JavaScript.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.560
It's there already.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.720
We do have polyfills for most of these features already.

16:04.720 --> 16:10.640
So use them and by stabilizing this stuff even also through the browser vendors, we

16:10.640 --> 16:16.120
might get better features even also in the future.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.480
Like for example, on mobile devices you might get a different UI, you might get a different

16:20.480 --> 16:24.760
keyboard or even also what we've shown regarding details and summary.

16:24.760 --> 16:30.240
It might be something that the browser vendors then could innovate on and for example bring

16:30.240 --> 16:34.520
in this cool feature regarding site search.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.520
So QA and testing.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.280
We had this question previously regarding testing.

16:38.280 --> 16:43.280
I think one of the easiest things is really to use, let's say easiest things, you do have

16:43.280 --> 16:45.760
the keyboard in front of you most of the time.

16:45.760 --> 16:53.760
So you could use the keyboard, use the tab key to try to navigate in the application

16:53.760 --> 16:59.120
that you're responsible for, that you're working for in the end and try to reach all of the

16:59.120 --> 17:00.880
interactive elements in there.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.520
Try to control the navigation for example.

17:03.520 --> 17:09.080
Try to see whether the focus is existing for example.

17:09.080 --> 17:13.880
There are so many things which are related to keyboard controls even only on the page

17:13.880 --> 17:19.960
where we do assume that the users are using a mouse but this is even also something that

17:19.960 --> 17:23.440
is beneficial for screen readers even also.

17:23.440 --> 17:30.480
It's obviously not something that is the only part, screen readers is even also what Danny

17:30.480 --> 17:35.440
talked about regarding semantic HTML but if you do see that it's not controllable by keyboard

17:35.440 --> 17:41.760
it's most likely even also giving screen reader users a hard time in the end.

17:41.760 --> 17:50.120
And this is the easiest one, Mike talked about some other tools we like to highlight at least

17:50.120 --> 17:54.680
Chrome developer tools so they do have some really nice stuff especially for contrast

17:54.680 --> 17:57.320
ratio for example we wanted to highlight over here.

17:57.320 --> 18:02.720
They do have Google Lighthouse where you could obviously measure so much more stuff but they

18:02.720 --> 18:07.280
do have an accessibility section in there even also giving you great tips in the end

18:07.280 --> 18:13.400
and they even also provide you insights into the accessibility tree which is the basis

18:13.400 --> 18:19.000
for rendering that stuff later on then in the or telling it to the screen reader.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.240
There was a great talk yesterday by Mozilla even also in optimizing this regarding performance

18:24.240 --> 18:29.320
and accessibility performance I would really suggest you to have a look on the recording

18:29.320 --> 18:33.120
for this one.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.660
Another part is the X DevTools.

18:35.660 --> 18:43.240
They do have something for CLI even also they do have plugins for the browsers.

18:43.240 --> 18:47.360
Why have we used the foster website over here?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.240
No hard feelings I'm sorry about it.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.920
Total issues 35.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.720
Let's skip that.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.160
Next slide.

18:57.160 --> 19:02.000
Still it's about the same message it's about the humans test with humans in the end.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.160
But it's something which gives you insight quite quickly it's something that is really

19:06.160 --> 19:13.440
low level in the end but talk to colleagues in your company in your field in the end.

19:13.440 --> 19:19.240
I'm even also working with several colleagues with disabilities and it was really inspiring

19:19.240 --> 19:24.080
in the end to see how all of this works and to go through this stuff.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.480
This is something that is really important talk to the users in the end who are using

19:28.480 --> 19:30.680
this.

19:30.680 --> 19:35.520
One of the last things previous to the questions that we wanted to bring up because we talked

19:35.520 --> 19:38.040
about it we had a quick conversation about it.

19:38.040 --> 19:45.360
We do know CVEs for example for a global database regarding security issues.

19:45.360 --> 19:51.200
Why don't we even also do this for accessibility vulnerabilities in the end because it's even

19:51.200 --> 19:56.200
also something that is becoming or that should become more important and that even also becomes

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
legal.

19:57.200 --> 20:04.560
So why not do something similar for accessibility and we leave you with this.

20:04.560 --> 20:12.320
Thank you very much for your attention and let's go over to your questions now.

20:12.320 --> 20:20.520
Yes please.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.520
I could repeat it.

20:21.520 --> 20:38.560
There are some elements for the date picker.

20:38.560 --> 20:42.600
It depends on the I would say yeah sure sorry I should repeat it.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.800
There are some elements in the end.

20:43.800 --> 20:44.800
Yeah yeah sorry.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.560
There are some elements the question was there are some elements like for example the date

20:48.560 --> 20:53.680
picker which are currently already identified as not being responsible in even the native

20:53.680 --> 20:55.680
browser implementation.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.760
So I think and the question was about whether I do know libraries which I could for example

20:59.760 --> 21:03.280
recommend I think in the end it's depending on the context that you're working in.

21:03.280 --> 21:07.600
So for example if there's a great Angular plugin you couldn't use it in your context

21:07.600 --> 21:12.320
so you always need to sadly do the research and search for a good plugin.

21:12.320 --> 21:18.840
I think and I talked about the standards previously I think it's so important to support those

21:18.840 --> 21:23.760
standards because if we do standardize all of this stuff then the browser vendors do

21:23.760 --> 21:28.640
have the chance even also to make things better in the future.

21:28.640 --> 21:33.760
This is the main point so I couldn't necessarily give a give a perfect suggestion at the moment

21:33.760 --> 21:37.800
but I do know about those issues at least date pickers it's quite hard.

21:37.800 --> 21:44.120
There's another initiative who are trying to even also come up with new solutions because

21:44.120 --> 21:50.320
even also most designers think about that these ugly let's say ugly standard elements

21:50.320 --> 21:56.400
in the browser that they that we need to overlay them because of design reasons and there's

21:56.400 --> 22:00.720
another initiative I don't remember the name who are even already coming up with something

22:00.720 --> 22:07.760
for example for the select menu to build this new but again I'm sorry I could even also

22:07.760 --> 22:13.520
we could add it to the slides afterwards and then it's in the link on the custom website.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.160
Yep thank you.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.160
Any more questions?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
Yes please.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
Yeah it's you Pablo.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
My question here is that by the time a developer has a chance to do that it's been in this space.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.160
At Dogebahn how do you approach this from a design perspective?

22:21.160 --> 22:46.800
Actually I know how to do this in a way that will pass a test.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
Yeah.

22:47.800 --> 23:14.360
So I do even also say the question again how do we approach accessibility not in the end

23:14.360 --> 23:20.280
not a testing but even already like for example in the concept phase and design process exactly.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.600
So I think it's mainly about to have this scaling in an organization it's only the first

23:25.600 --> 23:28.800
most important thing is about awareness from my point of view.

23:28.800 --> 23:34.400
So even already in our onboarding sessions for new employees we are having onboarding

23:34.400 --> 23:41.760
sessions we do have talks we do we do educate on accessibility even already.

23:41.760 --> 23:47.360
So I think the main thing is about awareness for all involved people in the end for product

23:47.360 --> 23:51.520
owners for designers for developers for testing in the end.

23:51.520 --> 23:55.440
I think it's mainly about awareness I would say and then you could only scale.

23:55.440 --> 23:59.840
So and I'd like to thank you for your product because we're really looking forward to your

23:59.840 --> 24:02.720
product you talked about thank you.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
So another question for.

24:03.720 --> 24:12.360
I'm afraid it's not only about awareness it's also about the right skill set.

24:12.360 --> 24:20.040
We are really struggling to find a talent accessibility talent in the design space.

24:20.040 --> 24:25.520
Awareness is fine but it's also about experience and really challenging projects.

24:25.520 --> 24:30.360
Totally totally it wasn't it wasn't about only aware you haven't said I know you haven't

24:30.360 --> 24:31.360
said it.

24:31.360 --> 24:36.280
It's it's repeated quite quickly it's not about only awareness it's even about the skill

24:36.280 --> 24:39.800
sets it's about experiences but you need to start somewhere.

24:39.800 --> 24:45.440
I mean you could build up experiences by starting and then having all the people getting those

24:45.440 --> 24:46.440
experiences in the end.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.960
I think I couldn't I couldn't have a better answer at least.

24:49.960 --> 24:54.600
We do have several teams who are specifically working on this even also education but even

24:54.600 --> 25:00.160
also testing from the very beginning even already educating concept and designers and

25:00.160 --> 25:02.160
all of these colleagues.

25:02.160 --> 25:07.000
But in the end I think it's yeah it's about skill set awareness and all of this stuff

25:07.000 --> 25:11.320
education talking to each other all of all of that stuff.

25:11.320 --> 25:18.480
This is what I could tell you for the moment but we could follow up.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.480
Time's up okay.

25:19.480 --> 25:25.320
Yeah we are still yeah sorry we are still here if you do have anything else to follow

25:25.320 --> 25:26.320
up.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.080
Yeah just come to us please.

25:28.080 --> 25:35.080
Thank you.
