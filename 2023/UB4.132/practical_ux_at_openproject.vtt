00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
So, this is the second talk related to open projects. I don't know if anyone went to the

00:10.480 --> 00:16.160
talk about integrations yesterday. Anybody? All right. Designers, I get it. So, this is

00:16.160 --> 00:21.040
Practical UX at open projects. So, I've been working there for a year and a half, and these

00:21.040 --> 00:25.600
are musings about the things I've learned, things we've gone through. It will all become

00:25.600 --> 00:31.520
clearer in a second. I'm Pyremol, and that's a very elaborate site to tell you my name is

00:31.520 --> 00:38.080
Pyremol, and I'm a UX designer at open projects. So, I think we can start with, I think we can

00:38.080 --> 00:44.080
all agree that the UX in open source could use a little bit of work. I think it's fair enough to

00:44.080 --> 00:50.800
say that, right? We know the reasons, but very quickly, some of the challenges we've had. Data

00:50.800 --> 00:57.200
design. When you have data design in software, and open source tends to have this sometimes,

00:57.200 --> 01:03.440
it is not necessarily intuitive, which makes it less attractive to new users, because they're

01:03.440 --> 01:07.840
comparing with a lot of other newer tools, and they tend to have all this shiny stuff, right?

01:08.720 --> 01:13.680
There tends to all sometimes be inconsistent behavior. The good thing about having contributors,

01:13.680 --> 01:19.440
all sorts of contributors over the years, is that it's open. Anyone can do things, can add new

01:19.440 --> 01:25.200
features, but if you lack a consistent coherent design language, then you do have the problem of

01:25.200 --> 01:32.400
inconsistency over time. There's also a lack of investment in designers. Now, this is, I think,

01:32.400 --> 01:37.040
in general, an open source has a lack of resources in general, right? Not always, but there tends to

01:37.040 --> 01:41.680
be this problem, and design does not tend to also be the priority for a lot of projects.

01:41.680 --> 01:49.360
There's also this tendency of open source projects being engineering driven. Not necessarily a problem,

01:49.360 --> 01:57.680
because this can generally mean a very fully functional, very feature-rich software, I'd say,

01:58.400 --> 02:02.400
but that does not necessarily translate to beginner-friendly software, because we don't

02:02.400 --> 02:08.720
manage to, again, attract new users, and UX and accessibility tend not to be immediate concerns

02:08.720 --> 02:14.880
of developers if they're not necessarily topics that concern them directly, and this also means

02:14.880 --> 02:24.480
that these tend to not be prioritized for that same reason. However, there are some positives to

02:25.120 --> 02:30.720
UX and open source, and that's that UX has also taken this dark turn through all the sort of

02:30.720 --> 02:35.440
Facebooks and the Microsofts and the Googles, where there's a lot of dark patterns, and UX

02:35.440 --> 02:39.840
designers and a lot of companies are encouraged to produce these dark patterns. We tend to not have

02:39.840 --> 02:44.240
this in open source, because we tend to want to create things that people like, and we're sort of

02:44.240 --> 02:49.200
bound by these values, though I think the fact that we're in of Fosse means we sort of have these

02:49.200 --> 02:54.720
values, and there's a spirit of sharing, which is why we're all here, and things are getting better,

02:54.720 --> 03:01.600
and I think that some of the talks at Fosse are showing us this. So that's the sort of point of

03:01.600 --> 03:09.760
which we're starting, but then we joined Mark and I, he's not here, but hi Mark, we joined Open

03:09.760 --> 03:15.600
Project in August 2021, and we were quite impressed, because Open Project, for quite a small company,

03:15.600 --> 03:21.120
decided to invest in two UX designers, which was quite a big deal for an open source project of

03:21.120 --> 03:27.280
about 30 developers. So we have a product team of the two UX designers and the CEO, so we take

03:27.280 --> 03:31.840
product decisions, but then we also try to work on the user experience. And the reason I joined

03:31.840 --> 03:36.880
Open Projects, because I come from a background of working in agencies, communication agencies,

03:36.880 --> 03:42.800
different world, with all the values that you guys share, that we all share, and seeing that

03:42.800 --> 03:47.600
a company was willing to put the resources in, and the goal was to improve user experience.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.560
What does this mean for Open Projects? To tell you this, I'd like to tell you a little bit about

03:52.560 --> 03:56.320
Open Project, because otherwise you won't know what I'm talking about. So Open Project is an

03:56.320 --> 04:02.160
open source project management and collaboration software that looks, I'll show you the screenshots

04:02.160 --> 04:06.080
in a bit, but I thought I'd tell you how we organize, so you get a sense of perhaps

04:06.080 --> 04:12.560
compared to other open source projects. We have about, I said we're a team of 30, about 15 devs,

04:12.560 --> 04:18.880
full stack, front, back, all that. We've got three product people, like I just said. We've got one QA,

04:18.880 --> 04:22.800
which I'll sort of connect to user experience a little bit, because if you can't test it doesn't

04:22.800 --> 04:29.360
quite work. A bit of marketing, some HR, and then sales and support. That's it, that's our entire

04:29.360 --> 04:33.360
ship. We've got two versions, the free community version that you can just download and install

04:33.360 --> 04:37.760
anywhere, and the enterprise with the support, quite a classic model. And you can install it

04:37.760 --> 04:44.000
on premises, on the cloud. We also offer hosting within the EU if you don't want your data sent

04:44.000 --> 04:49.520
anywhere else, and you can see some of our major clients, including Burshipban, who spoke earlier.

04:49.520 --> 04:56.080
Right, and the values that are very important to us are sort of the privacy, the data security,

04:56.080 --> 05:00.480
digital sovereignty. These are things that we're very, very passionate about, as are a lot of other

05:00.480 --> 05:07.200
projects who are speaking today. Something looks like that. List of work packages, tasks. This is

05:07.200 --> 05:11.360
actually what we're using to work on the new version that we're going to release in a couple of,

05:11.360 --> 05:16.960
well, we'll see when it gets released. It's been released this month, and so we work publicly,

05:16.960 --> 05:22.080
using open projects, obviously. And so you can see a bunch of some features, some epics we're

05:22.080 --> 05:28.400
working on. You could filter by priority, by status. I think you get the idea. You could go

05:28.400 --> 05:34.240
into a bug report that I submitted. And this is all public, by the way. And if you find a bug,

05:34.240 --> 05:39.760
you can also submit one. And you can see the description there, the activity, where you can

05:39.760 --> 05:46.080
really exchange with other users. You can tag them. That's very important to us as well. Connect

05:46.080 --> 05:50.640
to other files. We talked about integrations. We have an integration with Next Cloud. So if you

05:50.640 --> 05:56.480
upload files in Next Cloud, you can link to tasks and work packages in open projects.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.920
And I think that's a very common view, sort of a Kanban Scrum view, if you want to drag things

06:01.920 --> 06:06.800
around. We have that too. And we have a team planner. So if you want to organize your

06:08.080 --> 06:11.200
team and see who's doing what and reassign tasks, you can do that.

06:11.200 --> 06:18.320
So that gives you a sense of what the product is. Let's go to UX at open projects. Some things

06:18.320 --> 06:23.280
have happened since I joined, since Mark and I joined. We now have a design team. Previously,

06:23.280 --> 06:28.560
we didn't have one. Wasn't the priority. It was quite normal as well. Now we have two UX designers

06:28.560 --> 06:35.760
and a test person, a QA person, Ivana. We used to do Markups in PowerPoint. It did the job.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.960
But now we're working in Figma. And hopefully we can move to Penfot at some point.

06:38.960 --> 06:48.400
So we had a rudimentary style guide of HTML elements. And now we have a growing design system

06:49.040 --> 06:53.600
with reusable components that we're going to look at in a bit. It was quite engineering-driven.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.760
So the design, you can see that in the design as well. And now we're working alongside devs

06:59.760 --> 07:04.720
to get some early feedback. And we're not at loggerheads. It's not devs versus designers.

07:04.720 --> 07:10.480
We're trying to work from scratch and get early feedback. So these are things that we are changing

07:11.200 --> 07:20.560
within our way of working. Now, we all know the benefits of better UX. But for us, we've

07:20.560 --> 07:24.160
realized that even clients that have used our software for a very, very long time, if we can

07:24.960 --> 07:29.840
offer optimizations, even mine now, that's worth the time and effort. And of course, attracting

07:29.840 --> 07:35.440
new users is very important to us. Because we're not trying to only be the open source project

07:35.440 --> 07:39.600
management tool. We're also trying to compete as an alternative to the proprietary tools.

07:41.680 --> 07:46.560
So the challenge is, if you read the abstract, that was something I promised. And I will try to deliver.

07:47.920 --> 07:56.480
So, designers, us designers have a temptation to want to say, be helicopter into a project

07:56.480 --> 08:01.520
and design everything from scratch. I see that. I'll put something on Figma. Let's do this.

08:04.080 --> 08:09.200
It's not that easy. I think you guys know this. Because when you're working with an open source

08:09.200 --> 08:16.160
project, there are certain contextual constraints, let's say. Let's put it that way. It tends to be

08:16.160 --> 08:20.720
quite large open source applications. So you can't just change one thing and propagate it throughout

08:20.720 --> 08:25.680
the whole application. Because for example, the same element, say a drop down or a button,

08:25.680 --> 08:31.600
can appear very differently in different parts of the application. But not just visually. It might

08:31.600 --> 08:36.720
be implemented differently in all those places as well. Because again, multiple contributors over

08:36.720 --> 08:42.480
the years, no coherent design language. Sometimes you can even have different code layers. In our

08:42.480 --> 08:48.400
case, we have Angular and Ruby, which means the views aren't rendered quite the same way, everywhere.

08:49.040 --> 08:54.320
And the time, if you come up with a new design, it has then to be developed. And that time,

08:54.320 --> 09:00.160
that's time and effort that's competing with new feature developments, with maintenance,

09:00.160 --> 09:07.840
with bug fixing, and general dev time. So you can't just say, I've designed this, implement it,

09:07.840 --> 09:13.280
and we'll move on. You've got to balance it with all these other things. And of course, we realize

09:13.280 --> 09:20.080
that when you design a new feature, the requirements are very different between pro users and new users

09:20.080 --> 09:23.520
who are used to certain ways of working. And you say, oh, no, we're going to change something

09:23.520 --> 09:28.880
completely. The risk of that is, of course, the classic XKCD. I don't know if you know this one.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.800
There are 14 competing standards. And you're like, oh, you can't have that. We need to develop a one

09:32.800 --> 09:38.560
universal standard that works with everybody. And then you end up with 15 standards. We don't want

09:38.560 --> 09:46.320
that. So of course, data analytics helps often. It helps you get a sense of what users are doing,

09:46.320 --> 09:52.400
what they want, where they're getting stuck. And you could use Google Analytics. Or you could not

09:52.400 --> 09:57.520
use Google Analytics like we do and not have the data. Because it's very important for us not to

09:57.520 --> 10:02.560
track our users. So that makes our work slightly complicated because we don't quite know what people

10:02.560 --> 10:07.520
are doing. But it's very important to us that we don't do this, especially because, again, the data

10:07.520 --> 10:15.360
would not necessarily be within the EU. Having said that, we managed to ship our first big feature

10:15.360 --> 10:20.640
when we joined, Mark and I. It was a notification center. We were very proud of it because we didn't

10:20.640 --> 10:26.480
have any process, no UX process. And we still managed to do it. And because before this, all

10:26.480 --> 10:33.360
notifications in OpenProject were email based. If you sort of had a new package, a feature,

10:33.360 --> 10:37.760
someone answered it, added a new requirement, you'd get an email alert. You couldn't follow it

10:37.760 --> 10:43.040
within the application. So we designed this. Extremely proud of it. But it did ruffle some

10:43.040 --> 10:48.480
feathers because we said, all right, now the emails are only going to be digests, not for every single

10:48.480 --> 10:54.240
notification. But some people were used to this. So we're extremely proud of this feature. But we

10:54.240 --> 11:00.560
also learned that you've got to ease users in with these big changes. Perhaps we need to start small.

11:02.320 --> 11:10.640
Small means sort of manageable, developable, maintainable, testable, don't scare existing

11:10.640 --> 11:18.560
usable. That's sort of what we mean by small, reasonable, in other words. So when you want to

11:18.560 --> 11:24.000
change these things, there's a couple of different ways to go about it. You can change one thing

11:24.000 --> 11:29.440
everywhere in the application. So let's say a button. The button that we had doesn't quite

11:29.440 --> 11:34.000
work. We want to change it. We want to make it better. You could make that button the same,

11:34.000 --> 11:39.520
the new version, everywhere. But then individual pages would not be consistent, right? Or you could

11:39.520 --> 11:44.400
change everything in one page. It takes the settings page. We're going to update it with new

11:44.400 --> 11:49.680
components. We're going to make it standard. But then that standard, it's not across pages,

11:49.680 --> 11:52.320
it's not very standard, is it? You just changed the problem a little bit.

11:53.440 --> 11:59.360
So the approach we've gone with is we want to standardize the elements first. Remember how I

11:59.360 --> 12:03.760
told you that the same elements could be implemented in different ways in different places?

12:03.760 --> 12:10.160
Well, what if we first standardize the implementation, the HTML, the actual code of

12:10.160 --> 12:16.480
that element, and then we can modify it, can't we, once we come up with some sort of consistent way

12:16.480 --> 12:20.720
of doing it. That'll also help us understand how these elements are being used and the different

12:20.720 --> 12:27.200
variations we'll need. I'll give you an example. For a design presentation, it's been a lot of

12:27.200 --> 12:33.680
words, hasn't it? More images, please. This is the date picker that we used to have, and that's the

12:33.680 --> 12:39.440
date picker we have now. We changed it because we introduced a new feature which was taking work

12:39.440 --> 12:46.480
week into account. So sort of being able to say that Saturday and Sunday are holidays or could be

12:46.480 --> 12:51.520
a Friday depends on your company. So when we did this, we took the opportunity to upgrade it,

12:51.520 --> 12:57.520
and beyond this sort of aesthetic change, you'll notice that was an opportunity for us to then

12:57.520 --> 13:02.800
work on all these elements to try to better define what a button should look like, what an

13:02.800 --> 13:07.680
action bar should look like, what the blue when you tab across the application and you're changing

13:07.680 --> 13:12.320
the focus, what that should look like, because that wasn't very consistent either. So we took

13:12.320 --> 13:18.080
this opportunity, sort of new feature development to create these components, and not just things

13:18.080 --> 13:22.720
that are visible, but also things that are invisible like this, which we didn't quite have

13:22.720 --> 13:27.840
in the past. So that does mean that for now, you won't find this in all across the application.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.280
There are parts of the application that don't respect some of the things we've defined,

13:31.280 --> 13:36.960
but we are going iteratively one step at a time. And to do that, we need a design system.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.480
We call it the single point of truth, spot. And if there's a component that has not been

13:42.480 --> 13:46.800
included in the design system, we say it's not been Spotifyed. They can't really sue us.

13:46.800 --> 13:50.960
So what is a design system? For instance, sort of a consistent, dependable, reusable,

13:50.960 --> 13:58.720
reusable and documented set of things. These things could be styles, colors, spacing,

13:58.720 --> 14:05.200
things I showed you. Could be components, like buttons or text boxes, any of the little

14:05.200 --> 14:11.920
components that bigger interfaces are built out of. And then patterns that are a combination of

14:11.920 --> 14:16.960
these things. And the last bit is very important. You've got to then document it and tell people

14:16.960 --> 14:22.880
how to use it, when to use it, what to do, what not to do. And of course, as being an open source

14:22.880 --> 14:27.840
company, we publish all of it in our website. So anybody can go and look at it. So now when we say

14:27.840 --> 14:33.040
spacing two, everybody knows the developers, designers and the testers know what that spacing

14:33.040 --> 14:39.360
should look like. Same thing for action bars with a different variance. And then we go to our

14:39.360 --> 14:44.160
website, and then we try to explain those variants and how to use it. And this is public in our

14:44.160 --> 14:48.320
website. It's not complete yet. We're still working on our design system. So not all elements are

14:48.320 --> 14:56.320
there. But we are working on it. How's the speed? Am I speaking too fast for anyone? It's all right.

14:56.320 --> 15:03.440
Okay, well, I'll take a bit of a break and bring some water. You can appreciate our design system.

15:03.440 --> 15:10.880
So in some startups, they say, build fast and break things. We can't afford to do that. That's

15:10.880 --> 15:17.520
not our mantra. Our mantra is to build slow, iterate and test things. I say test things. We've

15:17.520 --> 15:23.520
not quite done it yet. That's our goal for this year. So we want to balance UX optimizations with

15:23.520 --> 15:29.520
feature dev. But like I showed you with the date picker, perhaps if we spend 40% of our time with

15:29.520 --> 15:35.840
feature development, we take that as an opportunity as well to optimize and maybe choose five core

15:35.840 --> 15:41.840
elements and then sort of fold them into our design system and try to make those consistent.

15:42.800 --> 15:49.440
Which requires sort of that means that there will be imperfection and there will be inconsistencies

15:49.440 --> 15:56.880
within the application. Our goal is to accept that imperfection and to keep moving. Because again,

15:56.880 --> 16:01.840
the developer doesn't like when things are inconsistent or some developers want it to be

16:01.840 --> 16:06.720
pixel perfect. Well, sometimes it's not going to be. And for those of you who speak French,

16:06.720 --> 16:14.000
the better is sometimes the enemy of the good. And sometimes you've got to accept the good enough

16:14.000 --> 16:21.840
to move forward to where you want to be. Very philosophic, I know. So the learnings for the past

16:21.840 --> 16:27.120
year and a half. It's very happy to be able to put that half symbol there. I thought it looked quite

16:27.120 --> 16:34.080
cool. So the first thing is you can't just join a project, be helicoptered in and magic wand the

16:34.080 --> 16:40.720
whole thing and say, great, we want to just change everything. Let's do it upgraded to 2024. You need

16:40.720 --> 16:47.680
incremental upgrades because you need everybody in the company to believe in what you're doing, be

16:47.680 --> 16:55.040
convinced it's worth the effort. And luckily, we have that sort of projects. But it's not an easy

16:55.040 --> 17:03.520
thing to do because there are competing competing requirements, competing priorities and how

17:03.520 --> 17:10.400
companies should use its time. So that's important to accept incremental, standardizing things now

17:10.400 --> 17:16.000
means a lot of time spent now. But down the road, it gives us more time to do that. And

17:16.000 --> 17:22.960
down the road, it gives us more time to do more relevant work. It's less time because things are

17:22.960 --> 17:27.760
already standardized. If we change a color, if we change the design, it'll change all across the

17:27.760 --> 17:33.360
application. We need to be pragmatic, try to make something a little better with every release, not

17:33.360 --> 17:38.400
go for everything in one release. But sometimes we do want to go for those big changes like we did

17:38.400 --> 17:44.160
with Notification Center. It might ruffle some feathers. But those changes are required because

17:44.160 --> 17:49.200
we have a vision for where the product needs to be. However, we've learned, perhaps the hard way,

17:49.200 --> 17:54.000
that we need to ease our users in who are used to the old system, help them understand why we're

17:54.000 --> 17:59.120
doing it. And in that regard, we also plan on communicating more from the product team,

17:59.120 --> 18:05.200
perhaps publishing the why and the how of how we work, why we take certain decisions. And finally,

18:05.200 --> 18:10.240
we could learn from other open source projects as designers. I mean, because developers do it

18:10.240 --> 18:15.280
quite a fair bit, I don't think we quite have that culture amongst designers. And we're currently

18:15.280 --> 18:20.800
working on theming. And I saw a presentation by Mathieu, Mathieu Brouet from Proton, who was

18:21.440 --> 18:26.000
in Paris where he was last year. And he was explaining how his company worked on theming,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.240
and all the things that he did that were wrong and what he learned from. And we were able to use that

18:30.800 --> 18:36.880
and learn from it. And that helped us save us time, sort of get a better sense of what we were

18:36.880 --> 18:42.000
doing. So thanks to Mathieu, who's not here, but I think that sort of sharing is very important.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.560
We should do more of that. And we really hope that this presentation maybe,

18:46.560 --> 18:53.520
hopefully, one day can help someone as well. So what are plans for 2023 then? More UX.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.880
Shocking, I know. So more UX, so more work on the design system, continue working on it, rather.

18:59.440 --> 19:04.080
More testing, because we've not really done any testing now. We haven't had the resources.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.320
But that's one of our plans. Even a basic hallway test where we ask five people what they think and

19:08.320 --> 19:14.480
if they understand the feature, is some input. We want to integrate more with other tools.

19:14.480 --> 19:19.760
Part of doing that is to take the design system and make it easy for someone creating a plugin

19:19.760 --> 19:25.280
or trying to integrate with Open Project to use those design elements as well. So that's one of

19:25.280 --> 19:29.840
the reasons we're working on the design system as well. And of course, better theming, like I just

19:29.840 --> 19:35.760
mentioned. And accessibility is something that we have in mind, but we could do a lot more.

19:35.760 --> 19:39.840
We could be a lot better at that. So that's one of our goals. And of course, we've got the usual

19:39.840 --> 19:45.920
suspects, the ongoing optimizations, and new features along the way. The goal, of course,

19:45.920 --> 19:51.760
then is to have more users who say they picked up Open Project for the UX. Not just because it's

19:51.760 --> 19:56.880
open source. Of course, we want them to pick up Open Project because it's open source. Of course.

19:56.880 --> 20:01.840
But if they say, we tried a bunch of tools, we think you guys have really good UX, that's our goal.

20:03.040 --> 20:10.400
But why stop there? Let's go further. A broader goal is to build an alternative to Microsoft 365

20:10.400 --> 20:16.720
with all the other actors, some of whom were here, Fostom. So Next Cloud, Open Exchange,

20:16.720 --> 20:24.080
Elements, Exmikki, Collabora, with all these other players. Let's give users an alternative

20:24.080 --> 20:31.360
that's respectful of their privacy, that is open source, and that respects data sovereignty.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.240
And if you're passionate about these things, I'm certainly not telling you that you should,

20:37.040 --> 20:41.360
you know, whether these companies are hiring, but they might be. Just saying.

20:41.360 --> 20:45.200
Thank you very much for giving me some time. And if you have any questions, I'll take them now.

20:45.200 --> 20:50.640
Yes.

20:52.400 --> 20:58.960
A lot of what you said reminds me of when I was at the Open Food Network doing similar things.

20:58.960 --> 21:04.160
This move was built on like Spree, and it was very like component messy, change it here,

21:04.160 --> 21:12.480
but not change it here. All those things. My question is, how beneficial or not is having your CEO

21:12.480 --> 21:19.200
on your product team to do things? That's a great question, actually, because for us,

21:20.240 --> 21:25.840
designers can also go too far. Because we want to change things very, very quickly,

21:25.840 --> 21:30.800
but there are some very pragmatic questions that are also development related, but also,

21:32.720 --> 21:36.560
let's say, related to the product roadmap. We think it's quite helpful, because then we can

21:36.560 --> 21:43.200
have the discussion internally and align ourselves rather than be at loggerheads again with, like,

21:43.200 --> 21:48.320
you can have designer versus developer, you can also have designer versus product. So we try to

21:48.320 --> 21:54.400
avoid that. So we think it works well. Yeah. Yes. Sorry.

21:56.880 --> 22:05.200
So the organization I work for, my university, have been paying enterprise users through project

22:05.200 --> 22:09.440
probably like a year and a half, two years. Glad to hear it. So I use it like every day. I really

22:09.440 --> 22:16.000
like it. Universally, 100% of the negative feedback I've received from my colleagues

22:16.000 --> 22:22.240
on open project have been explicitly related to the UX. Yeah. And so, and then pretty much all

22:22.240 --> 22:27.680
the positive feedback I've gotten from my colleagues have been related to specifically

22:27.680 --> 22:35.440
the UX improvements that you showed last 10 minutes. So these improvements are really

22:35.440 --> 22:41.840
important to us as an organization, but I realize that especially in open source products

22:42.960 --> 22:48.960
that are oftentimes very privacy focused, from my perspective, it seems like usually it's a very

22:48.960 --> 22:54.720
lab first adopters that have a priority among all of their customers, regardless, because there's

22:54.720 --> 22:59.440
just not an easy way to measure. Do you have any suggestions as like an organization that's

22:59.440 --> 23:03.920
paying for the product that really appreciates this work and wants it to be known by, I don't

23:03.920 --> 23:07.760
know, like your boss or something like that, that this work is important to us and matters?

23:08.560 --> 23:13.760
Okay. So I'll try to repeat the question. Yeah. So you said that one of the biggest complaints with

23:13.760 --> 23:19.600
open project was the UX and some of the positives in the recent times have been related to UX.

23:19.600 --> 23:25.280
And the question is, sometimes the early adopters tend to be the loudest and tend to get heard the

23:25.280 --> 23:29.920
most. So how do we get better at listening to the community in general? Yeah. Like what

23:29.920 --> 23:36.480
recommendations do you have for maybe customers? Yeah. Okay. Customers of open projects. So what

23:36.480 --> 23:40.640
recommendations would we have to them? Well, we have two things we can say. First of all,

23:40.640 --> 23:46.560
our community discussions are open. So if you feel very passionate, be passionate about a feature

23:46.560 --> 23:51.600
or a certain optimization, we really welcome that feedback and we will engage with you.

23:52.560 --> 23:59.120
It can be sometimes a bit tough to be on all fronts. So sometimes it's true that feedback

23:59.120 --> 24:04.880
can be a bit lost. We tend to track it with both an open project, but our biggest, perhaps a

24:04.880 --> 24:10.720
recommendation would be to engage with the community directly via community. And also,

24:10.720 --> 24:14.560
if you have an idea of some of the pull requests, that's also very, but that's not fair for a lot

24:14.560 --> 24:25.760
of people because, yeah. Well, thank you for using our project. Yeah. Yes. We will, we will test more.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.440
We'll start small with how we test and this quarter actually we have quarterly goes and

24:29.440 --> 24:33.120
so I'll go to test more. And there's a question back there. Perhaps it's the last one. Hi.

24:39.280 --> 24:43.200
Oh, other designers contribute. Oh, we've not had that yet. That's a good question. We might

24:43.200 --> 24:48.240
have to talk about it. So we have our design system that's quite open and everything. I mean,

24:48.960 --> 24:53.040
you could submit a pull request for pretty much anything, including our design system,

24:53.040 --> 24:58.080
but we've not quite had external developers. We are, we are obviously interested so we can talk.

24:58.080 --> 25:03.600
Yeah. Thank you. Do we have time for more questions or are we one more question if there is.

25:03.600 --> 25:12.400
Oh, hi. Thank you.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.640
That's that's yeah, that's good question. When we first arrived, there was a question of what

25:26.640 --> 25:32.000
the priorities should be. But there are a lot of issues with open project through feedback. We've

25:32.000 --> 25:36.960
got from our users that we already know about. We already have a backlog. That's I wouldn't say

25:36.960 --> 25:40.960
considerable, but we do have a backlog of known issues. So we thought we'll work on those first

25:40.960 --> 25:46.640
because we know that customers have told us that there were certain improvements and notification

25:46.640 --> 25:50.560
center, which was a passion project actually initially within the company. But it was also

25:50.560 --> 25:55.680
because we got some feedback about improvements that we could do and was also a feature that I

25:55.680 --> 26:02.080
think was quite required. It's quite a basic feature as well. So we were very happy to work on that.

26:02.080 --> 26:31.360
Thank you everybody. And if you have any questions, you can get there.
