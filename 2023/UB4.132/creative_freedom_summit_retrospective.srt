1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.960
So we have Emma and Jess talking about what they learned about the Creative Freedom Summit.

2
0:00:09.960 --> 0:00:16.080
So give a hand for them.

3
0:00:16.080 --> 0:00:19.680
Hi everybody and welcome to our talk.

4
0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:21.120
We're very excited to be here at FOSTA.

5
0:00:21.120 --> 0:00:23.640
It's both of our first times here.

6
0:00:23.640 --> 0:00:25.480
So very excited and nervous.

7
0:00:25.480 --> 0:00:27.160
Had a great time yesterday.

8
0:00:27.160 --> 0:00:33.680
So today we're just going to go through a summit that we hosted two weeks ago.

9
0:00:33.680 --> 0:00:37.720
We're going to explain what it is for people who weren't aware of it and then we're also

10
0:00:37.720 --> 0:00:42.000
going to see what went well and what could be improved.

11
0:00:42.000 --> 0:00:44.420
So just a small introduction first then.

12
0:00:44.420 --> 0:00:47.080
So my name is Emma Kidney.

13
0:00:47.080 --> 0:00:52.040
I'm an Associate Software Engineer at Redhat in their Community Platform Engineering team.

14
0:00:52.040 --> 0:00:57.440
Kind of the last year or so I've kind of been more at doing design work.

15
0:00:57.440 --> 0:01:00.600
Kind of slowly doing more design work, less dead work.

16
0:01:00.600 --> 0:01:06.880
I'm part of the Fedora design team and yeah, I utilize lots in every aspect of my work.

17
0:01:06.880 --> 0:01:10.440
Yeah, I'm an active member of the Fedora community.

18
0:01:10.440 --> 0:01:13.000
So I'll just pass you over to Jess then.

19
0:01:13.000 --> 0:01:21.880
So I'm Jess and so I joined the Redhat team in 2022 as a Fedora community designer intern

20
0:01:21.880 --> 0:01:24.520
for the Community Platform Engineering group.

21
0:01:24.520 --> 0:01:29.480
And I've got all open source software, Inkscape, Penpot of course.

22
0:01:29.480 --> 0:01:34.640
And just loads of other ones and creating numerous logos for the Fedora project as well

23
0:01:34.640 --> 0:01:36.520
that you might have seen around.

24
0:01:36.520 --> 0:01:40.440
So including this one.

25
0:01:40.440 --> 0:01:45.760
So yeah, so a little bit of the Creative Freedom Summit.

26
0:01:45.760 --> 0:01:49.560
It was a summit that we held, was it two weeks ago?

27
0:01:49.560 --> 0:01:50.560
Yeah, two weeks ago.

28
0:01:50.560 --> 0:01:58.800
So it was all over Jitsy and PeerTube and it's just, again, promoting loads of creative

29
0:01:58.800 --> 0:02:02.080
software that people might know about.

30
0:02:02.080 --> 0:02:05.040
So yeah, basically, yeah.

31
0:02:05.040 --> 0:02:06.200
What is the Creative Freedom Summit?

32
0:02:06.200 --> 0:02:11.760
So it's a virtual event focused on promoting open source tools, spreading knowledge of

33
0:02:11.760 --> 0:02:15.800
how to use them and connecting creators across the FOSS ecosystem.

34
0:02:15.800 --> 0:02:22.120
So the Summit's accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the first year.

35
0:02:22.120 --> 0:02:28.480
So what we, so the primary goals for this were, of course, promote open source creative

36
0:02:28.480 --> 0:02:35.240
software and also spreading knowledge of how to use it.

37
0:02:35.240 --> 0:02:39.960
So it's very important, like there's so many free software that people don't know about

38
0:02:39.960 --> 0:02:43.440
and it's great to give them that recognition.

39
0:02:43.440 --> 0:02:48.080
And also connecting creators across the FOSS ecosystem so other people who use these open

40
0:02:48.080 --> 0:02:53.440
source software can connect with each other and share ideas and all that sort of stuff.

41
0:02:53.440 --> 0:02:59.480
And then our secondary goals were to promote the Fedora design team as well as a welcoming

42
0:02:59.480 --> 0:03:00.480
group.

43
0:03:00.480 --> 0:03:08.520
So especially if you don't have a platform to show off what you've done on open source

44
0:03:08.520 --> 0:03:13.120
software, you can always join the Fedora design team.

45
0:03:13.120 --> 0:03:19.640
We also created potential onboarding path for new design contributors as well and spread

46
0:03:19.640 --> 0:03:23.600
info on how to use the creative open source tools in communities.

47
0:03:23.600 --> 0:03:26.800
So again, same as the last one.

48
0:03:26.800 --> 0:03:32.400
So showing how the Fedora design team will choose to make community stuff happen and

49
0:03:32.400 --> 0:03:38.240
have sessions like how the Fedora design team do this, that and the other and hoping it

50
0:03:38.240 --> 0:03:42.320
makes sense for easier for people to get involved.

51
0:03:42.320 --> 0:03:44.840
So what topics do we cover?

52
0:03:44.840 --> 0:03:47.360
So again, pen path.

53
0:03:47.360 --> 0:03:52.920
So if you don't know what it is, if you missed the first talk, it's a web based design and

54
0:03:52.920 --> 0:03:55.360
prototyping platform.

55
0:03:55.360 --> 0:03:58.320
Inkscape as well, which I love.

56
0:03:58.320 --> 0:04:04.520
And powerful, it's a vector based graphics editor.

57
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:10.080
Blender, Krita and Caiden live, I assume you might have went to the KDE stand that was

58
0:04:10.080 --> 0:04:18.440
around and GIMP and accessibility as well, which is very important in the design aspect

59
0:04:18.440 --> 0:04:22.400
of things like colour blindness palettes and stuff like that.

60
0:04:22.400 --> 0:04:27.200
And then the free software was actually, it's like free patterns for different crafts, so

61
0:04:27.200 --> 0:04:32.280
more kind of a hands on design thing rather than technical.

62
0:04:32.280 --> 0:04:36.720
And creative professional, professional using open source software.

63
0:04:36.720 --> 0:04:42.240
So we had some people as well who, and of course, us as well, like using free open source

64
0:04:42.240 --> 0:04:46.680
in a professional aspect and many others.

65
0:04:46.680 --> 0:04:52.840
So we had an amazing line up of speakers, so Maureen Duffy and David Roy, to name a

66
0:04:52.840 --> 0:04:54.120
few.

67
0:04:54.120 --> 0:04:59.560
And we had social hours that include the audience and helped build a sense of community.

68
0:04:59.560 --> 0:05:03.240
So some of these include a hack and craft, which is kind of like the free software.

69
0:05:03.240 --> 0:05:07.520
It's by the same person, Morgan Lemmer-Weber.

70
0:05:07.520 --> 0:05:12.160
And so we were basically like for the hack and craft, we were all like knitting and making

71
0:05:12.160 --> 0:05:18.000
sewing things, but also talking about open source and Pictionary and Gartic phone.

72
0:05:18.000 --> 0:05:21.080
So it was really fun.

73
0:05:21.080 --> 0:05:25.120
And then of course, wouldn't be possible without our sponsors.

74
0:05:25.120 --> 0:05:28.920
So Fedora and Red Hat were the main sponsors.

75
0:05:28.920 --> 0:05:35.800
And then the platforms we used to share was element, so people could interact in the chat.

76
0:05:35.800 --> 0:05:38.200
Jitsi was for the live streaming part.

77
0:05:38.200 --> 0:05:39.200
Oh, sorry.

78
0:05:39.200 --> 0:05:44.640
Jitsi was the video part, so we all went into a call and then Piritu was the live streaming

79
0:05:44.640 --> 0:05:45.920
part of it.

80
0:05:45.920 --> 0:05:49.600
So yeah, I'm going to hand you over to Emma for the retrospective.

81
0:05:49.600 --> 0:05:50.600
Nice.

82
0:05:50.600 --> 0:05:51.600
Okay.

83
0:05:51.600 --> 0:05:53.140
The retrospective.

84
0:05:53.140 --> 0:05:55.880
So just some details then as well.

85
0:05:55.880 --> 0:06:02.120
So when it took place, as Jess said, around two-ish weeks ago, January 17th to the 19th.

86
0:06:02.120 --> 0:06:03.120
What platform?

87
0:06:03.120 --> 0:06:08.240
We used Jitsi, streamed with Piritu, and then Element and Matrix were used for the audience

88
0:06:08.240 --> 0:06:11.360
to interact with each other and the speakers.

89
0:06:11.360 --> 0:06:12.720
What if you didn't make it?

90
0:06:12.720 --> 0:06:16.680
The recordings are available on the Create Freedom Summit's Piritu.

91
0:06:16.680 --> 0:06:23.360
And we'll soon be uploaded to Fedora YouTube when editing is complete, where we have some

92
0:06:23.360 --> 0:06:28.360
great contributors at the minute converting the raw video files over into properly-caught

93
0:06:28.360 --> 0:06:31.920
and published talks.

94
0:06:31.920 --> 0:06:33.000
And was there a badge?

95
0:06:33.000 --> 0:06:36.720
The important question when an event is run by Fedora.

96
0:06:36.720 --> 0:06:38.120
Yes, there was a badge.

97
0:06:38.120 --> 0:06:44.240
It was designed by Jess again and was able to be claimed by anyone with Fedora badges

98
0:06:44.240 --> 0:06:49.400
account and it was claimed around 48 times, I believe.

99
0:06:49.400 --> 0:06:56.320
And also if you're wondering why we had a badge, the Summit was all about promoting

100
0:06:56.320 --> 0:07:00.880
open source design and then obviously as the Fedora design team, there can be a lot of

101
0:07:00.880 --> 0:07:04.520
overlap then between the two communities.

102
0:07:04.520 --> 0:07:08.200
Here's just an example of what the setup looked like if you were to attend the Summit.

103
0:07:08.200 --> 0:07:12.760
So at the top there you have a little widget for the livestream.

104
0:07:12.760 --> 0:07:16.840
We have another little kind of notepad feature there where you can type out any questions

105
0:07:16.840 --> 0:07:21.040
you might have, some information, kind of frequently asked questions and then we have

106
0:07:21.040 --> 0:07:24.960
the chat there then so people can interact with each other.

107
0:07:24.960 --> 0:07:30.520
And also the background channel for the talk.

108
0:07:30.520 --> 0:07:36.280
Oh yeah, oh yeah, because if you wanted to just watch the talk and not be involved in

109
0:07:36.280 --> 0:07:40.760
the chat room, you just watch directly with the Piritu link as well.

110
0:07:40.760 --> 0:07:41.760
How did the event go?

111
0:07:41.760 --> 0:07:44.840
It went very well.

112
0:07:44.840 --> 0:07:49.840
We had 18 speakers take part with an average of 50 viewers per session which is very good

113
0:07:49.840 --> 0:07:51.640
for our first time round.

114
0:07:51.640 --> 0:07:57.000
We had more than 700 unique viewers spread out across 54 different countries.

115
0:07:57.000 --> 0:08:01.440
In the element chat room we came up to around 250 members.

116
0:08:01.440 --> 0:08:05.960
So we were kind of aiming for 100 in the element chat room but so the fact we kind of doubled

117
0:08:05.960 --> 0:08:08.200
that is great.

118
0:08:08.200 --> 0:08:10.320
So what went well?

119
0:08:10.320 --> 0:08:12.720
Viewers loved the setup we had.

120
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:16.400
They were able to watch videos soon after they were live as well due to the system that

121
0:08:16.400 --> 0:08:17.400
we were using.

122
0:08:17.400 --> 0:08:22.800
The chat room was very friendly and there was a real strong sense of community there.

123
0:08:22.800 --> 0:08:25.320
The audience had a lot of back and forth with the speakers as well.

124
0:08:25.320 --> 0:08:29.320
There was a lot of interactions at the social events and a lot of interest.

125
0:08:29.320 --> 0:08:34.600
Also no code of conduct issues which is always nice.

126
0:08:34.600 --> 0:08:38.400
So we got to see some amazing work.

127
0:08:38.400 --> 0:08:44.200
We had some speed painting sessions there with grease pencil and blender that's been

128
0:08:44.200 --> 0:08:46.680
painting with Krita.

129
0:08:46.680 --> 0:08:48.400
An Inkscape tutorial.

130
0:08:48.400 --> 0:08:51.560
There's a software blender as well.

131
0:08:51.560 --> 0:08:56.040
There was a good few things about blender.

132
0:08:56.040 --> 0:08:58.080
What can we improve for next year?

133
0:08:58.080 --> 0:08:59.840
So what didn't work?

134
0:08:59.840 --> 0:09:02.920
We're going to try and create a guide for next year with guidance on how to use the

135
0:09:02.920 --> 0:09:07.520
platform because from a newbie perspective if you're not familiar with matrix elements

136
0:09:07.520 --> 0:09:12.520
or that kind of thing it can be a bit far and a bit hard to get into.

137
0:09:12.520 --> 0:09:16.080
We also need to look into auto captions then as well.

138
0:09:16.080 --> 0:09:19.920
Since we used Jitsi and PureTube we did not have live captions during the summit.

139
0:09:19.920 --> 0:09:24.560
We were able to add them in post production but it would have been nice to have it while

140
0:09:24.560 --> 0:09:26.480
the event was happening.

141
0:09:26.480 --> 0:09:30.840
So we're going to look into some open source tools that can be used alongside Jitsi.

142
0:09:30.840 --> 0:09:36.880
Hopefully we can stick with that arrangement and then if not maybe look into some alternatives.

143
0:09:36.880 --> 0:09:39.040
So what's next then?

144
0:09:39.040 --> 0:09:40.520
So calls for proposals.

145
0:09:40.520 --> 0:09:45.960
So dependent on speaker capacity and interest we'll probably do a call for proposals around

146
0:09:45.960 --> 0:09:48.280
two to three months prior to the event.

147
0:09:48.280 --> 0:09:52.160
There's a lot of interest in the audience to get involved themselves, present their

148
0:09:52.160 --> 0:09:55.160
own talks and share their knowledge.

149
0:09:55.160 --> 0:09:58.640
We want to keep group and interaction growing throughout the year.

150
0:09:58.640 --> 0:10:02.560
This can bring more people into the community, maintain their interests, maybe have socials,

151
0:10:02.560 --> 0:10:08.320
fire challenges, little mini events, spread the word so participate in talks like this

152
0:10:08.320 --> 0:10:16.080
one, get involved in more of the open source design forums, all the different communities.

153
0:10:16.080 --> 0:10:19.400
Planning is a major part so we're going to give ourselves some more time to implement

154
0:10:19.400 --> 0:10:26.760
improvements, trials, some things out and then if any errors come up.

155
0:10:26.760 --> 0:10:30.480
So yeah I'm going to pass it over to Jess then just in case you're interested in participating

156
0:10:30.480 --> 0:10:32.400
in Fedora.

157
0:10:32.400 --> 0:10:38.760
So a little bit of a segue I suppose since we're all, it's very heavily supported by

158
0:10:38.760 --> 0:10:43.520
the Fedora design team so if you would like to be interested in the next one.

159
0:10:43.520 --> 0:10:47.840
So if you would like to, there's a Fedora account that you can create.

160
0:10:47.840 --> 0:10:54.440
You can create it at accounts.fidoraproduct.org and you can use it to sign into the element

161
0:10:54.440 --> 0:11:03.680
as well and it's very kind of, it's like the main account to use especially with a somewhat

162
0:11:03.680 --> 0:11:04.760
like this.

163
0:11:04.760 --> 0:11:09.520
So if you want to learn more about Fedora, it's all on the Fedora docs and also if you

164
0:11:09.520 --> 0:11:15.520
do join.fidoraproduct.org it gives you all the links that you can use as well.

165
0:11:15.520 --> 0:11:22.520
Shows our missions, our foundations, all the user documentation and you can look us up

166
0:11:22.520 --> 0:11:25.240
and ping us if you need anything.

167
0:11:25.240 --> 0:11:27.880
And then also yeah you can hang out with us.

168
0:11:27.880 --> 0:11:32.880
So in the element chat we have a Fedora design element chat where people share what they've

169
0:11:32.880 --> 0:11:40.200
been contributing and if anyone needs feedback from like the more senior people or like just

170
0:11:40.200 --> 0:11:45.000
in general it's a really good place to be.

171
0:11:45.000 --> 0:11:49.560
Fedora marketing as well and there's many more channels as well even if you're not really

172
0:11:49.560 --> 0:11:54.880
interested in design, there's infrastructure, there's many more, loads.

173
0:11:54.880 --> 0:11:57.760
So and yeah where to find us.

174
0:11:57.760 --> 0:12:08.040
So the matrix channel there, creativefreedom.fidora.in and then our website is the creativefreedom.com

175
0:12:08.040 --> 0:12:13.120
where you can get all the information and we have like when we were playing it as well

176
0:12:13.120 --> 0:12:18.920
we had all of our, we had a live like schedule going on and you can click on it and it brings

177
0:12:18.920 --> 0:12:26.200
you to the streams and then again the Fedora design team matrix channel is there and then

178
0:12:26.200 --> 0:12:27.800
that's us.

179
0:12:27.800 --> 0:12:29.880
So if you have any questions.

180
0:12:29.880 --> 0:12:30.880
Yeah so.

181
0:12:30.880 --> 0:12:38.080
We're planning on making kind of like an annual event so it will hopefully happen around January

182
0:12:38.080 --> 0:12:39.240
next year as well.

183
0:12:39.240 --> 0:12:43.360
So feel free to enter the matrix channel, ping myself or Jess, we'd be more than happy

184
0:12:43.360 --> 0:12:47.840
to punch in the right direction if you're not sure on how to use matrix or element,

185
0:12:47.840 --> 0:12:50.280
anything like that.

186
0:12:50.280 --> 0:12:53.120
So yeah I think that's our talk.

187
0:12:53.120 --> 0:12:54.120
Thank you.

188
0:12:54.120 --> 0:13:00.120
Does anyone have any questions?

189
0:13:00.120 --> 0:13:01.120
No?

190
0:13:01.120 --> 0:13:02.120
Yes.

191
0:13:02.120 --> 0:13:03.120
Yes.

192
0:13:03.120 --> 0:13:14.120
I understand this is going to be online this year, do you plan to keep that format for the

193
0:13:14.120 --> 0:13:15.120
future?

194
0:13:15.120 --> 0:13:21.680
It's, I suppose it's making open source design tools kind of more accessible so we'd like

195
0:13:21.680 --> 0:13:26.440
to kind of keep it a virtual event I think for the foreseeable future.

196
0:13:26.440 --> 0:13:29.880
Maybe there might be so many events, things like that we haven't really discussed it but

197
0:13:29.880 --> 0:13:36.440
we do like the online aspect that you know anyone can join so it is yeah.

198
0:13:36.440 --> 0:13:41.000
Yeah I suppose it's yeah just making it more accessible for people.

199
0:13:41.000 --> 0:13:46.800
So yeah does anyone else have any questions?

200
0:13:46.800 --> 0:13:47.800
Yeah.

201
0:13:47.800 --> 0:13:59.960
So I'll just repeat the question so we were just asked what would we like to see more

202
0:13:59.960 --> 0:14:02.640
of in the next summit.

203
0:14:02.640 --> 0:14:11.480
So I suppose just getting the numbers off like you know like it's good to see you know

204
0:14:11.480 --> 0:14:19.960
just make make it more well it is approachable I suppose but I don't know it's a tough question.

205
0:14:19.960 --> 0:14:23.600
I'd like to see more of like the craft inside a thing and the open source design aspect

206
0:14:23.600 --> 0:14:27.560
because I thought that was really interesting when Morgan came in and was talking about

207
0:14:27.560 --> 0:14:33.200
having you know open source design say of like sewing patterns things like that making

208
0:14:33.200 --> 0:14:36.960
clothing more accessible to people it was kind of an aspect of design I didn't really

209
0:14:36.960 --> 0:14:41.720
think of even though I'm into like crocheting and knitting and stuff myself so it was mad

210
0:14:41.720 --> 0:14:47.400
just to kind of see like a hobby and like work kind of come together then so I thought

211
0:14:47.400 --> 0:14:53.560
that was quite interesting yeah I'd like to see more of that.

212
0:14:53.560 --> 0:15:01.960
Okay yeah we also have a stand-down in Building H as well so we'll probably be there after

213
0:15:01.960 --> 0:15:02.960
this.

214
0:15:02.960 --> 0:15:03.960
Thank you.

215
0:15:03.960 --> 0:15:04.960
Thank you.

216
0:15:04.960 --> 0:15:25.960
Thank you.
