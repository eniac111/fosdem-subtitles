WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
We started and we went through a number of stages like a lot of projects do.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
We started with a small donation. We were trying to build up and get into a system where we could be self-sustaining

00:21.000 --> 00:33.000
because we wanted to actually have the ability to move faster. We wanted to build a better project for our community.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
And the way we wanted to do that was we wanted to bring full-time developers into the project.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
And as of 2022, we've been successful. We have two full-time developers working on the KiCAD project.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
We have eight other core developers who are all contributing and hundreds of people around the world

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
who we are able to successfully fund to help work on the project.

00:57.000 --> 01:04.000
Icon designers, documentations, librarians, all of the people that it takes to make a large open-source project work

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
is sustained by our donations, by our community.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
And I want to tell you a little bit about how this came to be because this wasn't obvious and it wasn't immediate

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
and it wasn't just putting up a single page.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
So initially, our first donation page looked like this. And you can see I've kind of squished it down, right?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
So I could see the whole page. But if you looked at it on your web browser, you would see the top little picture.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
And you had to go all the way down to get to your donations. Now, quick.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
I would like someone in the room to donate 120 Swiss franc to the KiCAD project.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
Okay. The question was, for each user who went in there, who didn't happen to use Swiss franc as their base currency,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
how much is going to show up on my credit card bill if I decide to support the project?

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
How do I know that this is going to actually support the project?

02:08.000 --> 02:22.000
All of these initial pain points in our first generation of a donation page were there because we picked what was available,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
the projects that were supporting us. We were initially working through the CERN Open Society Foundation.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
And they provided this, but they worked in Swiss francs because they're CERN.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
And our users, maybe not so much. We were initially seeing very few donations from this site.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
So I'm going to tell you how we fixed it. Six ways. Or six steps.

02:47.000 --> 02:55.000
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to identify who our users are because this drives every single choice we make in design.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Who is going to be the person who we're talking to.

02:58.000 --> 03:07.000
Then, never interrupt the experience that your community has, your donors have,

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
because the moment that you interrupt their experiences, the moment that they have better things to do.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
You always want to respect their time. Then, shorten that click path.

03:19.000 --> 03:28.000
Make sure that you're not setting yourself up for failure by putting intermediate steps that you don't have to have.

03:28.000 --> 03:37.000
Every time that you have to click on another link, you are going to lose more and more of your community before they get to that final point,

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
where they can actually come in to the larger community.

03:42.000 --> 03:52.000
Donations in-house. There are a lot of places that will actually set up donations.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
I'm going to tell you, you need to do that yourself. Then test every single step.

03:58.000 --> 04:10.000
And finally, build your community because this is the basic raison d'Ãªtre that we have as open source developers.

04:10.000 --> 04:23.000
We are a community. We are stronger as a community. This should be focused as the primary reason for each element in our donations.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
First, who is your customer? Who is the user base that you are trying to support?

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
For KiCad, we were a bunch of engineers. We were a bunch of circuit designers.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
The professionals who were building those circuits were our audience.

04:47.000 --> 05:04.000
So we needed to set up the system to reflect that. Your designers or your customers are also in this space who you are focusing on.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
It's not just what you do for a living. It's where you are in the world.

05:09.000 --> 05:20.000
What language do you speak natively? What are you most comfortable in? Because once you can make your audience comfort, your community more comfortable,

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
then that is a time in which your community becomes stronger, becomes more tightly bound together.

05:27.000 --> 05:40.000
For us, we need to identify where we are. This is actual data. For KiCad, where do we see people coming into the project?

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
We gather anonymized data that is sorted by country.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
The actual map here are top five regions, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and the UK.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Notice Switzerland is not in the top five.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
We were doing this wrong in the beginning. We were setting up a barrier in the beginning.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
We should be donating in Euro. We should be donating in US dollar.

06:13.000 --> 06:22.000
We should be donating in yen, in pound. But Swiss franc is maybe not the currency we should have chosen.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
We need to address this. The first step that we do is we try to address this.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
We joined in 2019. The Linux Foundation started a crowdfunding project.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
This was a way of bringing donations into open source projects.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
We joined this at the outset.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Our primary reason, even though the Linux Foundation site is slow,

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
even though they still have multiple clicks and require way too much data to allow you to donate,

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
even with all of that, just changing from Swiss franc to US dollar donations,

07:03.000 --> 07:11.000
met more of our community's needs. Our donations increased from about 10 per month to about 30 per month, which is good.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
It's a low increase because then we start to bring more people into our community.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
But we need to do more. We want to say, all right, what are the pain points still?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
We're still slow. We still require multiple clicks.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm going to say, don't interrupt. Don't interrupt your donor's experience.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I love GitHub sponsors. It's a wonderful program.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
If you're doing that, that's great.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
But you will never grow your community by putting the GitHub sponsors up there,

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
because the only people who are going to go up to the top of that page and find that button

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and click on that button are people who are already looking for it.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
Because no one goes to this page unless they want to download your software.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Unless they want to download their software.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
And the download is down here. And the sponsor is all the way up there.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And so you have to go out of your way to find this.

08:06.000 --> 08:15.000
So setting up this, for us, we identify, this is the KiCad website,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
we identify why do you go to the KiCad website.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
You go to the KiCad website to get KiCad, to download KiCad.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
And so, if we're respecting our community's time,

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
we don't make them go out of their way to the donate button in the top right hand corner.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
We start with making sure that they get to do what they came here to do first,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
which is download the software.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
So once you click on the download, instead of just showing a static page,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
we start the download, and while they're waiting, we give them the opportunity to donate.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Because this means, this says, you are already accomplishing what you started,

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
what you wanted to do, and we're going to give you this awesome software.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Your software is awesome too.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
So that then becomes an opportunity while you're waiting.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Maybe you also want to donate.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
And so this right here gave us an enormous increase,

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
because people were now willing to say, that's a good idea,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
because I want this software to be better.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
I want to support this thing that I use,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and our donations increase to 80 per month at this point.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, part and parcel to this is shortening your click path,

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
because if you're respecting your community's time,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
you don't make them jump through hoops.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
Our initial page had 9 to 12 clicks over 4 pages,

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
and it went through Postmates, and it was a mess.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Our current page, every time we shortened it, we saw more people coming in.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
And so we're right now at 1 to 2 clicks over 2 pages.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We'd like to get it even smaller,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
but that's where we're at right now,

10:18.000 --> 10:27.000
because we have built this sub-site that we hold on our own.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So you can't shorten the click path

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
if you don't own your own project's donation page,

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
because then you're at the mercy of whatever intermediary

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
is going to be in between your community and you.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
So we built this ourselves, and we put it behind a CDN,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
a content delivery network, because we want this fast.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
We want this to be directly at the user to the extent that we can.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
Right now, when you see this, all you need to do is,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
if you like the suggested donation, you click.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's one click.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
If you don't like the suggested donation,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
you can change it to whatever you want and then click through.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So maybe two if you want to change it.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
We go through Stripe.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
We go through Stripe for the reason that we can pick

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
how people are allowed to donate.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
So within China, for instance,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
where a large number of our users are,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
we can link into OlliePay through Stripe.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
And this allows our Chinese user base

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
to integrate into our community better than they would be able to

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
if we required credit cards, which are not common in China.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
Similarly, JiroPay in Europe, we link that in,

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
SEPA payments, all of these things are accessible through Stripe,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
which is one of the reasons why we chose it.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
But there are other options as well.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
And then we also added PayPal.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Now, people have different feelings about PayPal, and that's fine.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
But what I'm going to tell you is that if your community uses PayPal,

12:26.000 --> 12:34.000
then you should use PayPal because that is meeting them where they're at right now.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
So bring your donations in-house.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
Internal are where you are controlling the information.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
And external, you need to get the information from someone else.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
And I'm going to tell you that internal is where you want to be

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
because you get to make your own donation page,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
you get to make it as fast as you possibly can,

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
and you get to control the individual steps.

12:59.000 --> 13:07.000
Every time that you make your users, make your community wait to donate,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
every time you increase that load time by 100 milliseconds,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
you've lost 20 percent of people.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
They will go back. They'll click the back button.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
They'll go out and go somewhere else because you're not sure if it's loading or not.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
You get information when you bring it in.

13:27.000 --> 13:35.000
Bring this into your own organization because it allows you to connect with your community.

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
And you get to every single donation should have a thank you from your project.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
You should never leave people out hanging, saying,

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
oh, I just sent this money into the ether. I hope it does something good.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Send them a thank you.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Send them a thank you because it lets them know that the community has received it,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
that they appreciate it, and you include in there a link into your forum,

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
into your bug tracker, into the other ways that the community connects.

14:11.000 --> 14:21.000
And this allows you to build these communities that bind all of us together more closely.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And finally, test.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Real quick, A-B testing, piece of cake.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Never change everything outright.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Never make a new donation page and get rid of your old one.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You make donate 41.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
You want to change something, you make donate 42.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And the only thing that you need to change is some simple little JavaScript.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
If math.random is less than.5, go to this one.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Otherwise, go to that one.

14:50.000 --> 14:56.000
Two different pages, and each of them should have an embedded code in there,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
an embedded number that you get to send to Stripe

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
because you're controlling your own donation pipeline now.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
So you get to send that to Stripe, you get to send that to PayPal,

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
so that when you do this, when you make a change,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
you get to look for your metrics,

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
and you get to measure what the changes effect is.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
And whether you are trying to get people to join your mailing list

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
because you want to announce releases

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
or you want to get them to support the project or new users coming in,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
whatever it is, you are trying to change.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
You won't know if you've achieved it unless you're measuring it.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
So measure it in a way that respects people's privacy.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
Measure it in a way that allows you to be the most effective you can

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
in building your community.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
And finally, every donation is an opportunity to build your community

16:02.000 --> 16:10.000
because your donors are the most invested customers in your project.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And you should treat them that way.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
You should bring them in because they saw fit to support you financially.

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
They deserve to have that community wrap them in ways that are supportive

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
and give them the opportunity to be part of the larger project.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Every donor gets a thank you email,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
and then give them ways to deepen that connection,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
offer them things that are straightforward.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
So t-shirts for donation levels or badges on your user forum,

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
all of these are ways to build that connection between your community and your project.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And then directed donations give you more information

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
about what your users are interested in.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Finally, support your upstream.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Because all of us stand on each other's shoulders.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
So when you are, whether you are a houseplant, open source project,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
just doing this for yourself or you're a big large project,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
if you're receiving donations, pass that up.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Because the things that allow you to build your project

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
and allow all of us to do better are the things that we should be supporting ourselves.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
So last couple of tips.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Be transparent.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Show people how much processing charges are in the project.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
And allow them to donate a specific amount to your project.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
You can add a small checkbox to round up to the donation amount.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
And always, always, always, if you're doing your donation page, watch for fraud.

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
Because there are a lot of bad actors who will automatically try to use your donation page

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
to verify stolen credit card numbers.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
So when you do this, you watch out for this because it's not just an ethical responsibility,

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
it's a financial responsibility to actually make sure that people are not being charged

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
for things that they don't know.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
And so in this case, you can see this was all within one minute.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
This is actual attack on the KiCad donation website.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
It's like 30 donations per minute.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
They were just cycling through a bunch of credit cards.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
And we found the one that they work, that they succeeded,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
and we reported it as fraud.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And they stop after you do that for a little while.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
So thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
If there are any questions, I'm happy to take them.

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
APPLAUSE

19:02.000 --> 19:09.000
Not actually a question, but I think I don't now remember which open source project it was.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
But it might have been KiCad, actually, even.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But I remember it was very nice to have like a donation page,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
which then listed a bunch of new features kind of that came up recently.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And just said that these were made possible thanks to your customers.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I think that was an excellent way.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Because it's true.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:36.000
So the statement was that there was that you can show what the donations have done.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And one of the things that KiCad does is after you donate,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
it shows you a thank you page after the donation,

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
and that it has a little graphic of all the things that we've done in the past year.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
And we update that about once a year or so.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
So yeah.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah. There we go.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Yes.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
How and why did you understand that this implementation was in successfully?

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
So the question was how and why do we know that we needed to make changes?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
We weren't where we needed to be.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
So we wanted to support full-time developers.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
And we did not have the funding level to be able to do that.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
So we wanted to increase that to be able to develop the project faster and better.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
And we knew because we periodically dog-fooded ourselves.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
We'd try and the developers will donate, not just our time,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
but we'll practice going through the donation page.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
And it was painful.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
So we'd click and we'd be like, oh, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And then we'd get there.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
And I had to pull up the, like, how much is 120 Swiss franc in euro?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And now I know.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
But intuitively, I didn't know that.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
So we, dog-fooding what you build is an important step.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
And it costs you a $5 donation, which is, you know, you run it through there

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
and you're supporting a good project when you do this.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yes?

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
How do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Yeah, so the question is how do you handle one-time donation versus recurring donation?

21:31.000 --> 21:37.000
So we have right here a highlighted one-time and monthly.

21:37.000 --> 21:44.000
So we have this option and you can set up the back end to do that.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
Right now we only support that through PayPal because we don't want to be responsible

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
for keeping track of user accounts.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
And PayPal allows you to set up subscriptions without the user account.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
So right now we do that through PayPal.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.000
But the thing to watch out for is to make sure in your design that you're very,

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
very clear about what the user is doing.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
Are they, do they have a subscription or do they have a one-time?

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
So when you click on this, instead of saying donate, this is donate via PayPal

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
or donate via credit card, e-wallet.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Instead of saying donate, we change that to subscribe.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
So we do a couple of things to make it really, really obvious

22:27.000 --> 22:33.000
that if you move this slider over here and click on this button,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
you're signing up for a monthly subscription.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
We still have people making the mistake though.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
So we're still working out, we're still doing A-B testing to see can we get that better.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Yes?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It's more of a suggestion then.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Great.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
So make sure Amazon has the one-click button on the right.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It's kind of in there, you got subscribe.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
So it will give them the opportunity.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
The suggestion is to have a separate button for the subscribe.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Yes, that's, that's.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
We try to check out, just keep those because you've got two ways.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I'm going to A-B test that and we'll see what comes out.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Yes?

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
If you're worried about putting all your eggs in one basket,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
in terms of like, I have an open collective account.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yes.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
How does this put my credit card information into K,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
why can't I just do it with that open collective account?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
You absolutely can.

23:21.000 --> 23:29.000
And I skipped by a couple of the options here on for, here we go.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
So open collective, Petran, coffee, Linux Foundation,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
if that's where your community is, do that.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Absolutely.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
That's fantastic.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
If your, if your community is on coffee, you should be,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
you should have coffee on there.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
But, but there's a, there's a balance to be struck.

23:51.000 --> 23:58.000
And open collective is nice, but it's one, two, three clicks deep.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
You, and we don't, we've never seen a way to shorten that and we can't cash it.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
So it does add a couple steps, but I do know a lot of projects that,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
that use it, that use it successfully and that like it a lot.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
So definitely, you know, test it out.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
But, you know, try to replace one of the buttons,

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
A, B testing with open collective and see if that's where your community is.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
And the only way you know that is by checking.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah, so I think we're a little bit over time.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
So, yeah, you can all come up with a question.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Thank you.

24:32.000 --> 24:50.000
Thank you.
