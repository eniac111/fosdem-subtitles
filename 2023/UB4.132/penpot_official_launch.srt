1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:16.880
Wednesday, when we did the unboxing event, that since we do hope that everyone will be

2
0:00:16.880 --> 0:00:21.600
welcome to a PEM port project, we needed to make sure that the invite system could cope

3
0:00:21.600 --> 0:00:28.280
with all the different use cases that you get with our link expiration, who got the

4
0:00:28.280 --> 0:00:31.480
invite, do any to re-send it, etc.

5
0:00:31.480 --> 0:00:37.720
Otherwise the onboarding experience would be tough and people would not be joining the

6
0:00:37.720 --> 0:00:39.400
design project.

7
0:00:39.400 --> 0:00:44.200
And this is very important for us because this is not only a tool for designers to just

8
0:00:44.200 --> 0:00:48.440
express their creativity but also for developers to join the design process, to be welcome

9
0:00:48.440 --> 0:00:49.440
there.

10
0:00:49.440 --> 0:00:53.880
So this is very important for us.

11
0:00:53.880 --> 0:00:59.480
But of course we had many improvements in the interactive prototype feature.

12
0:00:59.480 --> 0:01:03.660
This is just one example for the overlay advancement.

13
0:01:03.660 --> 0:01:13.940
So here you can see how a design asset is being self-referred and you get a very nice

14
0:01:13.940 --> 0:01:21.360
pixel perfect overlay on a button and then an animation that comes with a mouse click.

15
0:01:21.360 --> 0:01:23.400
Do you like this?

16
0:01:23.400 --> 0:01:24.400
I think you do.

17
0:01:24.400 --> 0:01:25.400
Yeah, I think you do.

18
0:01:25.400 --> 0:01:26.400
This is happening.

19
0:01:26.400 --> 0:01:27.400
This is happening.

20
0:01:27.400 --> 0:01:28.400
This is awesome.

21
0:01:28.400 --> 0:01:29.480
This is amazing.

22
0:01:29.480 --> 0:01:31.520
So this is just about a token.

23
0:01:31.520 --> 0:01:37.320
I do mean, I mean, do go and enjoy PEM port.

24
0:01:37.320 --> 0:01:41.080
But it has many features on advanced prototyping.

25
0:01:41.080 --> 0:01:47.120
But this is one thing that actually came from this official release.

26
0:01:47.120 --> 0:01:50.680
As it did nested boards.

27
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:58.520
So here you can see in this animation, like an independent board being dragged to another

28
0:01:58.520 --> 0:02:01.720
board and having this nesting effect.

29
0:02:01.720 --> 0:02:07.480
This actually was a bit tricky because as you know PEM port uses SVG natively.

30
0:02:07.480 --> 0:02:12.740
So when I say open standards, we do really mean open standards.

31
0:02:12.740 --> 0:02:17.320
And it was tough to have this root element having everything.

32
0:02:17.320 --> 0:02:23.000
So to have different independent components being designed, we had to do this nested board

33
0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:25.040
trick.

34
0:02:25.040 --> 0:02:31.040
But that trick actually gave us a lot of potential because when you have nested boards, you can

35
0:02:31.040 --> 0:02:34.920
do much more advanced compositing in general.

36
0:02:34.920 --> 0:02:36.760
And so we have like the best of all worlds.

37
0:02:36.760 --> 0:02:43.320
We have SVG, but also these neat tricks for compositing.

38
0:02:43.320 --> 0:02:53.920
Also, let me remind you for those of you that don't know much about PEM port that we have

39
0:02:53.920 --> 0:02:57.520
like some innovations in terms of where to find stuff.

40
0:02:57.520 --> 0:03:01.120
When you do engineering, you think about scale.

41
0:03:01.120 --> 0:03:02.120
Like I need to scale up.

42
0:03:02.120 --> 0:03:03.120
I need to automate.

43
0:03:03.120 --> 0:03:10.080
I need to have everything like in tiny bits so I can combine them any way I want.

44
0:03:10.080 --> 0:03:14.080
With design, with big design architectures, you have that same challenge.

45
0:03:14.080 --> 0:03:16.520
Otherwise, it gets just manual.

46
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:18.120
Like design is just manual.

47
0:03:18.120 --> 0:03:22.360
And it can only go as far as your brain can cope with stuff.

48
0:03:22.360 --> 0:03:28.080
So having like your components, your libraries and assets readily available here, whether

49
0:03:28.080 --> 0:03:34.320
there are fonts or colors or design tokens or whatever, it's really cool.

50
0:03:34.320 --> 0:03:40.400
Also a whole lot of libraries, and you drag and drop or you create new ones and they are

51
0:03:40.400 --> 0:03:44.680
there on your left pane.

52
0:03:44.680 --> 0:03:51.240
So this actually comes from the PEM port design system, which is the first one example that

53
0:03:51.240 --> 0:03:52.960
you can one-click import.

54
0:03:52.960 --> 0:03:55.840
If you go to PEM port, you do the onboarding.

55
0:03:55.840 --> 0:03:56.840
It's very nice.

56
0:03:56.840 --> 0:04:01.360
By the way, it's a nice bottle challenge that you can try and do.

57
0:04:01.360 --> 0:04:03.600
Anyone here did the bottle challenge?

58
0:04:03.600 --> 0:04:04.600
Okay.

59
0:04:04.600 --> 0:04:05.600
Some of you do.

60
0:04:05.600 --> 0:04:09.360
It's a nice little game where you learn by fun.

61
0:04:09.360 --> 0:04:13.720
It's like you learn the PEM port basics using this bottle challenge.

62
0:04:13.720 --> 0:04:18.920
But when you actually go into more advanced topics, this is what you really need.

63
0:04:18.920 --> 0:04:28.680
So go and check the PEM port design system because it's kind of neatly organized.

64
0:04:28.680 --> 0:04:36.520
And then we get something so cool that no one had, which is FlexLayout.

65
0:04:36.520 --> 0:04:42.960
So every design and prototyping system out there would have this killer feature where

66
0:04:42.960 --> 0:04:46.640
you can smartly apply rules to your design.

67
0:04:46.640 --> 0:04:49.520
Say I want my design to flow this way.

68
0:04:49.520 --> 0:04:54.840
And then you would change the content within that design and those rules would apply automatically.

69
0:04:54.840 --> 0:05:00.780
So for designers, I'm seeing people are saying, yes, yes, I know why we're talking here.

70
0:05:00.780 --> 0:05:06.200
Some designers would feel a massive productivity boost thanks to that.

71
0:05:06.200 --> 0:05:11.240
You can call it auto layout, smart layout, fancy layout, whatever.

72
0:05:11.240 --> 0:05:18.320
They could not have this once they were exposed to that.

73
0:05:18.320 --> 0:05:24.320
It's like not having this once you know about this intelligent layout system is like going

74
0:05:24.320 --> 0:05:28.960
really back in time and having to do everything manually.

75
0:05:28.960 --> 0:05:39.120
So the problem with this, as we thought at PEM port, was that unfortunately, these layout

76
0:05:39.120 --> 0:05:49.240
systems were design-centric, which is not bad per se, but was not developer-friendly.

77
0:05:49.240 --> 0:05:55.840
Basically it was not team-friendly, meaning designers would do their smart layout system

78
0:05:55.840 --> 0:06:00.500
and then all the vocabulary and the ideas, the abstractions were just for designers to

79
0:06:00.500 --> 0:06:02.320
understand and to enjoy.

80
0:06:02.320 --> 0:06:11.640
And then developers would go there and say, I need to translate this into code.

81
0:06:11.640 --> 0:06:16.040
Let's hope there's no issues, but there were issues.

82
0:06:16.040 --> 0:06:20.560
Not only technical issues, but also friction issues like back and forth.

83
0:06:20.560 --> 0:06:22.480
This, am I in control?

84
0:06:22.480 --> 0:06:23.960
No, I'm not.

85
0:06:23.960 --> 0:06:26.840
Neither the designer nor the developer.

86
0:06:26.840 --> 0:06:31.560
They would feel like they would have to constantly double check, double check.

87
0:06:31.560 --> 0:06:37.320
And you don't scale up your design or your code if you have to do that.

88
0:06:37.320 --> 0:06:43.320
PEM port came with a completely different approach and said, what if we have code-first

89
0:06:43.320 --> 0:06:45.180
design layout?

90
0:06:45.180 --> 0:06:49.160
What if already the design is the code?

91
0:06:49.160 --> 0:06:51.800
You can do a ton of stuff with Flex, CSS.

92
0:06:51.800 --> 0:06:54.500
It's actually quite advanced.

93
0:06:54.500 --> 0:07:01.920
So what if we say, let's do a developer-first design layout system?

94
0:07:01.920 --> 0:07:07.920
And we came up with Flex layout, and please do applaud here, because it's the first ever

95
0:07:07.920 --> 0:07:12.800
tool to have this, and it's open source.

96
0:07:12.800 --> 0:07:24.200
And the great thing about this is that this is not a gift from engineers to designers

97
0:07:24.200 --> 0:07:26.760
saying, I made this for you.

98
0:07:26.760 --> 0:07:27.760
Please use it.

99
0:07:27.760 --> 0:07:29.880
I hope you're excited about this.

100
0:07:29.880 --> 0:07:32.600
But actually, designers wanted this.

101
0:07:32.600 --> 0:07:34.440
So no compromises here.

102
0:07:34.440 --> 0:07:37.040
Everyone wins.

103
0:07:37.040 --> 0:07:42.160
We got 50 to 60 volunteers for the beta testing of this.

104
0:07:42.160 --> 0:07:47.440
And I'm not saying you could not test it using our development branch, but a proper environment

105
0:07:47.440 --> 0:07:54.840
setup for people to go and do some simple tests like this one and give us feedback.

106
0:07:54.840 --> 0:07:56.560
And the feedback was phenomenal.

107
0:07:56.560 --> 0:08:01.960
I think 80% came from designers and 20% from engineers.

108
0:08:01.960 --> 0:08:03.080
So that was nice.

109
0:08:03.080 --> 0:08:05.840
That was nice.

110
0:08:05.840 --> 0:08:10.520
Given the fact that in the world, so that you know it, statistically, there's one designer

111
0:08:10.520 --> 0:08:13.720
pretend developers, roughly.

112
0:08:13.720 --> 0:08:16.600
We don't think that's a good ratio.

113
0:08:16.600 --> 0:08:20.720
At college, we have one to two, so pretty different.

114
0:08:20.720 --> 0:08:23.160
Somewhere in between, perhaps, one to four would be great.

115
0:08:23.160 --> 0:08:27.120
But of course, to beta test this, we couldn't have the one to ten ratio in our pod.

116
0:08:27.120 --> 0:08:29.040
We needed to reverse that.

117
0:08:29.040 --> 0:08:35.160
But we didn't have to work hard to achieve that, because designers were actually asking

118
0:08:35.160 --> 0:08:37.980
to beta test this in the first place.

119
0:08:37.980 --> 0:08:44.160
So if you're familiar with Flex CSS, you can see properties there.

120
0:08:44.160 --> 0:08:53.440
And then, of course, you get, here I'm simulating two, this is a real time collaboration, because

121
0:08:53.440 --> 0:08:55.800
we do have real time collaboration, of course.

122
0:08:55.800 --> 0:08:57.440
And this is like two browsers.

123
0:08:57.440 --> 0:09:01.800
It doesn't look like that, because I made it pixel perfect in a way.

124
0:09:01.800 --> 0:09:06.640
But that code pane there, the code inspector, is actually a second browser just beneath.

125
0:09:06.640 --> 0:09:07.640
Right?

126
0:09:07.640 --> 0:09:08.640
It's just in fancy.

127
0:09:08.640 --> 0:09:11.480
But you can see how real time that is changing.

128
0:09:11.480 --> 0:09:16.320
So a designer is changing the design using Flex layout.

129
0:09:16.320 --> 0:09:21.240
And as the designer does that, the developer can see that code being changed.

130
0:09:21.240 --> 0:09:24.520
Just is a different tab selection there.

131
0:09:24.520 --> 0:09:26.360
That's all it takes.

132
0:09:26.360 --> 0:09:32.360
So I'm not saying that a developer should be quickly copy and pasting when it changes.

133
0:09:32.360 --> 0:09:34.280
But it's nice for the demo.

134
0:09:34.280 --> 0:09:36.480
You see that it's real.

135
0:09:36.480 --> 0:09:42.440
There's no like export concept of anything.

136
0:09:42.440 --> 0:09:46.480
And really, that's it.

137
0:09:46.480 --> 0:09:47.480
Thank you.

138
0:09:47.480 --> 0:09:49.800
It happened.

139
0:09:49.800 --> 0:10:01.920
I do hope we have some time for questions, because I planned for that.

140
0:10:01.920 --> 0:10:02.920
That is great.

141
0:10:02.920 --> 0:10:06.720
That's a real point.

142
0:10:06.720 --> 0:10:10.520
I'd rather not pick if you could store that.

143
0:10:10.520 --> 0:10:12.880
You had done it really, really quickly.

144
0:10:12.880 --> 0:10:14.880
So that's going to be impressive.

145
0:10:14.880 --> 0:10:16.880
Thank you for the talk.

146
0:10:16.880 --> 0:10:19.560
My company is providing a design system.

147
0:10:19.560 --> 0:10:22.880
And they provide it for Sigma, or Figma.

148
0:10:22.880 --> 0:10:20.240
And is there any kind of process I can follow to use the assets in Pen

149
0:10:20.240 --> 0:10:21.240
Toit?

150
0:10:21.240 --> 0:10:32.240
Or do we have something that exists to guide me?

151
0:10:32.240 --> 0:10:36.640
So the question was about perhaps migrating the design system from.

152
0:10:36.640 --> 0:10:39.360
We already have a company design system.

153
0:10:39.360 --> 0:10:44.400
So I have to respect this library with the assets and the design itself.

154
0:10:44.400 --> 0:10:48.440
I just want to use it in Pen Toit.

155
0:10:48.440 --> 0:10:54.920
So if you are using a design system on Figma right now, and you want also to use Pen Toit,

156
0:10:54.920 --> 0:10:56.880
there's a ton of overlap.

157
0:10:56.880 --> 0:11:01.760
So it might feel weird for you to use the two if you're not migrating.

158
0:11:01.760 --> 0:11:07.360
The answer is I'm not sure it makes sense, because this is about team dynamics.

159
0:11:07.360 --> 0:11:09.760
This is about people collaborating.

160
0:11:09.760 --> 0:11:15.920
So unless you want to export these Figma assets and use it privately for you, with

161
0:11:15.920 --> 0:11:20.320
no going back, if that is, I mean, you're smiling, so I guess that's what I want.

162
0:11:20.320 --> 0:11:22.480
I want to live in my private open source world.

163
0:11:22.480 --> 0:11:27.280
I'm not going to pay for licenses for the whole team.

164
0:11:27.280 --> 0:11:32.720
But that seems to me, I get that you can save some money doing that.

165
0:11:32.720 --> 0:11:36.240
But honestly, it's going to not save you much time.

166
0:11:36.240 --> 0:11:41.720
So you have to keep a balance there, because it's going to be back and forth, not within

167
0:11:41.720 --> 0:11:46.880
Pen Pot, but within two tools that compete in the space of the use case.

168
0:11:46.880 --> 0:11:51.220
But I mean, go ahead and tell me how it looks.

169
0:11:51.220 --> 0:11:55.760
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I think it's going to have a bit of overhead for you.

170
0:11:55.760 --> 0:11:58.400
If you're willing to take that, you have a sticker.

171
0:11:58.400 --> 0:12:02.800
I'll give you a sticker, like the shiny one.

172
0:12:02.800 --> 0:12:05.040
By the way, who was, may I ask a question?

173
0:12:05.040 --> 0:12:06.560
Who was here three years ago?

174
0:12:06.560 --> 0:12:08.080
Can you raise your hand?

175
0:12:08.080 --> 0:12:09.200
Oh, OK, yeah.

176
0:12:09.200 --> 0:12:12.480
OK, we have stickers, like super premium stickers for you.

177
0:12:12.480 --> 0:12:13.480
Next question.

178
0:12:13.480 --> 0:12:14.480
Yeah.

179
0:12:14.480 --> 0:12:17.480
So good relations with the release.

180
0:12:17.480 --> 0:12:25.240
My question is, you showed us there was a live update of the output code when you were

181
0:12:25.240 --> 0:12:26.240
using the designer.

182
0:12:26.240 --> 0:12:27.240
Yes.

183
0:12:27.240 --> 0:12:28.240
Is there a reverse also possible?

184
0:12:28.240 --> 0:12:35.240
Can I as a developer give a piece of code to the designer and can he copy paste it into

185
0:12:35.240 --> 0:12:36.240
some way?

186
0:12:36.240 --> 0:12:43.600
So the question is, we saw the real time transformation between the design and the code.

187
0:12:43.600 --> 0:12:44.600
Is it full duplex?

188
0:12:44.600 --> 0:12:46.840
Can I change the code?

189
0:12:46.840 --> 0:12:47.840
Not for now.

190
0:12:47.840 --> 0:12:48.840
Not for now.

191
0:12:48.840 --> 0:12:49.840
Not for now.

192
0:12:49.840 --> 0:12:55.080
But of course, it feels like you would like to do the other way around.

193
0:12:55.080 --> 0:13:02.760
I'll actually go on with that question theme and say, what if you connect that with a gear

194
0:13:02.760 --> 0:13:06.000
repository?

195
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:13.800
And you change that in the gear repository that comes back and changes the design.

196
0:13:13.800 --> 0:13:18.480
What if as a designer you change something that also goes to the gear repository and triggers

197
0:13:18.480 --> 0:13:20.680
a CICD process?

198
0:13:20.680 --> 0:13:21.680
OK.

199
0:13:21.680 --> 0:13:28.840
So we thought about that because it's kind of what comes next, obviously.

200
0:13:28.840 --> 0:13:32.280
But yeah, so good question.

201
0:13:32.280 --> 0:13:33.280
We've got to be covered.

202
0:13:33.280 --> 0:13:34.280
OK.

203
0:13:34.280 --> 0:13:35.280
So the...

204
0:13:35.280 --> 0:13:36.280
Yes, yes.

205
0:13:36.280 --> 0:13:37.280
The person...

206
0:13:37.280 --> 0:13:47.280
I should just run over and say this person.

207
0:13:47.280 --> 0:13:50.160
Congratulations.

208
0:13:50.160 --> 0:13:51.160
Thank you.

209
0:13:51.160 --> 0:14:13.080
So, resources for helping teams migrating from other tools to PEMPA?

210
0:14:13.080 --> 0:14:18.320
Yeah, yeah, I mean...

211
0:14:18.320 --> 0:14:20.680
Figma, what is that?

212
0:14:20.680 --> 0:14:24.120
Fagma owns 80% of the market for designers.

213
0:14:24.120 --> 0:14:25.120
80%.

214
0:14:25.120 --> 0:14:29.480
Adobe now owns 87% of the market.

215
0:14:29.480 --> 0:14:31.320
Thanks to that.

216
0:14:31.320 --> 0:14:34.640
So obviously, yeah, I get that.

217
0:14:34.640 --> 0:14:38.800
We have a plugin, an export plugin.

218
0:14:38.800 --> 0:14:43.600
We hope that the community can help us just improve it so that you can basically export

219
0:14:43.600 --> 0:14:44.840
all that from...

220
0:14:44.840 --> 0:14:51.280
We actually don't know how much time we've got for that plugin to be OK for Figma, but

221
0:14:51.280 --> 0:14:52.280
it's still there.

222
0:14:52.280 --> 0:14:54.960
So that is one way you can quickly test that.

223
0:14:54.960 --> 0:14:57.520
It's not, by any means, complete.

224
0:14:57.520 --> 0:15:01.600
So it will give you the basics, but it might be enough.

225
0:15:01.600 --> 0:15:06.800
And then I think everything like exporting stuff and just re-importing that is really

226
0:15:06.800 --> 0:15:13.440
quick for teams to have the design system re-uploaded here somehow.

227
0:15:13.440 --> 0:15:15.080
I don't think it's going to take much time.

228
0:15:15.080 --> 0:15:17.360
If you have the motivation, it's just...

229
0:15:17.360 --> 0:15:21.080
I mean, depending on the complexity of the prototypes and design...

230
0:15:21.080 --> 0:15:23.600
This is for prototyping, and this is also for design.

231
0:15:23.600 --> 0:15:27.040
So depending on the complexity for each topic, it might get...

232
0:15:27.040 --> 0:15:32.480
But yeah, the export plugin, we really hope that we get more help from the community.

233
0:15:32.480 --> 0:15:43.400
So if anyone here is interested in those serialization challenges for the SVG and the JSON,

234
0:15:43.400 --> 0:15:47.280
because it's all it has, really, that would be great.

235
0:15:47.280 --> 0:15:53.080
From the abstraction model that we have from Figma to actually proper open standards, fine.

236
0:15:53.080 --> 0:15:55.080
So yeah, that's good.

237
0:15:55.080 --> 0:15:59.720
I actually realized that I figured it out myself.

238
0:15:59.720 --> 0:16:00.720
OK.

239
0:16:00.720 --> 0:16:02.720
So I'll answer your question.

240
0:16:02.720 --> 0:16:05.720
So there was somebody over here that had a...

241
0:16:05.720 --> 0:16:07.720
Congrats on the launch.

242
0:16:07.720 --> 0:16:08.720
Thank you.

243
0:16:08.720 --> 0:16:09.720
It's really great to see.

244
0:16:09.720 --> 0:16:11.720
I'm curious about the business side of things.

245
0:16:11.720 --> 0:16:13.720
You mentioned Figma as a competitor.

246
0:16:13.720 --> 0:16:18.720
How do you plan to continue with Figma and be successful at it, and at the same time,

247
0:16:18.720 --> 0:16:20.720
drive your business forward?

248
0:16:20.720 --> 0:16:22.720
So Calleres is a company.

249
0:16:22.720 --> 0:16:26.720
Actually, there's a title called Calleres Open Source.

250
0:16:26.720 --> 0:16:29.720
That's the SL, because we're a Spanish company.

251
0:16:29.720 --> 0:16:34.720
So the idea for us is to make sure that we follow this...

252
0:16:34.720 --> 0:16:41.720
We think it's going to be kind of an enterprise edition that will give companies things that

253
0:16:41.720 --> 0:16:45.720
the power user does not want or doesn't need.

254
0:16:45.720 --> 0:16:50.720
We call that privately, publicly tax the controller.

255
0:16:50.720 --> 0:16:51.720
OK.

256
0:16:51.720 --> 0:16:56.720
So that is something that we don't really need right now, because, to be honest,

257
0:16:56.720 --> 0:17:00.720
there's still a ton of things that we have to do for the product.

258
0:17:00.720 --> 0:17:07.720
But basically, perhaps in two years, if we are relevant, we hope we are relevant.

259
0:17:07.720 --> 0:17:09.720
We'll see.

260
0:17:09.720 --> 0:17:12.720
See you in two years, post them.

261
0:17:12.720 --> 0:17:20.720
But if we are really relevant, then we will look for those tax the controller features

262
0:17:20.720 --> 0:17:23.720
that the companies are fine.

263
0:17:23.720 --> 0:17:25.720
They won't contribute with code.

264
0:17:25.720 --> 0:17:27.720
They won't contribute with content.

265
0:17:27.720 --> 0:17:29.720
They will contribute with money.

266
0:17:29.720 --> 0:17:32.720
So we don't have the details, but it's going to be like...

267
0:17:32.720 --> 0:17:35.720
And this has been publicly said many times.

268
0:17:35.720 --> 0:17:39.720
The power user gets open source forever.

269
0:17:39.720 --> 0:17:42.720
If the company is wanting to have this control mechanism,

270
0:17:42.720 --> 0:17:45.720
they will have to pay for something that is exclusive to them,

271
0:17:45.720 --> 0:17:47.720
whether it's self-host or SaaS.

272
0:17:47.720 --> 0:17:48.720
We don't care.

273
0:17:48.720 --> 0:17:52.720
Actually, by the way, there is also a desktop app by the community

274
0:17:52.720 --> 0:17:55.720
that encapsulated Penpot with Electron.

275
0:17:55.720 --> 0:17:59.720
So you can also have a pure desktop native experience.

276
0:17:59.720 --> 0:18:04.720
So yeah, it's there actually in the community space, community.penpot.app.

277
0:18:04.720 --> 0:18:06.720
We will elaborate a bit more on that.

278
0:18:06.720 --> 0:18:13.720
The only way this will be sustainable as a company is that we are really relevant.

279
0:18:13.720 --> 0:18:19.720
Surprisingly, the design space, in our view, is quite immature.

280
0:18:19.720 --> 0:18:23.720
You have one tool, winner takes all.

281
0:18:23.720 --> 0:18:27.720
Then the next tool, then the next, there are subsequent winners.

282
0:18:27.720 --> 0:18:34.720
We hope that we add fragmentation to that, but still be relevant.

283
0:18:34.720 --> 0:18:37.720
So we have like one minute left.

284
0:18:37.720 --> 0:18:39.720
Yeah, I answered your question.

285
0:18:39.720 --> 0:18:40.720
You answered the second part.

286
0:18:40.720 --> 0:18:43.720
I missed the first part of how you actually tend to compete with Figma.

287
0:18:43.720 --> 0:18:47.720
You tend to maybe drive business away from Figma toward Penpot.

288
0:18:47.720 --> 0:18:54.720
Well, I think the playbook that we have is quite unique and unprecedented.

289
0:18:54.720 --> 0:18:57.720
This is open source design and prototyping tool.

290
0:18:57.720 --> 0:19:04.720
So we hope that we have a bottom-up distribution model.

291
0:19:04.720 --> 0:19:06.720
People are really saying this is actually much better.

292
0:19:06.720 --> 0:19:12.720
And we are hoping, this is part of our, yeah, this is hope,

293
0:19:12.720 --> 0:19:15.720
that you remember that ratio, one designer, pretend developers,

294
0:19:15.720 --> 0:19:21.720
that developers actually loving open source do bring Penpot to the forefront.

295
0:19:21.720 --> 0:19:25.720
Without the help from open source developers, I'm sure this is not going to happen.

296
0:19:25.720 --> 0:19:28.720
Not because designers don't like open source,

297
0:19:28.720 --> 0:19:33.720
just because the economics of that will take much longer.

298
0:19:33.720 --> 0:19:39.720
So yeah, that one to 10 ratio is the only time I'm happy with that ratio,

299
0:19:39.720 --> 0:19:41.720
in this particular case it's like.

300
0:19:41.720 --> 0:19:44.720
So we are counting on open source developers really.

301
0:19:44.720 --> 0:19:45.720
Thank you.

302
0:19:45.720 --> 0:19:47.720
So, no worries on coming.

303
0:19:47.720 --> 0:19:49.720
Okay, if you want to have a chat afterwards,

304
0:19:49.720 --> 0:19:53.720
I'm sure Pablo is very, very happy to answer questions.

305
0:19:53.720 --> 0:19:57.720
So that's, we have five minutes for people to leave and people to come in.

306
0:19:57.720 --> 0:19:59.720
So I'm going to say thank you, Pablo.

307
0:19:59.720 --> 0:20:00.720
Thank you.

308
0:20:00.720 --> 0:20:01.720
Thank you.

309
0:20:01.720 --> 0:20:02.720
Thank you.

310
0:20:02.720 --> 0:20:03.720
Thank you.

311
0:20:03.720 --> 0:20:04.720
Thank you.

312
0:20:04.720 --> 0:20:05.720
Thank you.

313
0:20:05.720 --> 0:20:06.720
Thank you.

314
0:20:06.720 --> 0:20:07.720
Thank you.

315
0:20:07.720 --> 0:20:08.720
Thank you.

316
0:20:08.720 --> 0:20:09.720
Thank you.

317
0:20:09.720 --> 0:20:10.720
Thank you.

318
0:20:10.720 --> 0:20:16.720
Thank you.
