1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
Hello.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Oh, that works.

3
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Cool.

4
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:10.000
So, welcome to the PostgresQL dev room.

5
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:23.440
If you just got here, you missed all the early morning excitement.

6
0:00:23.440 --> 0:00:26.000
These guys know.

7
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:31.120
Can I please ask you, because this is a very loud room, take care with the seats, because

8
0:00:31.120 --> 0:00:35.040
they're very loud, and please silence your phones.

9
0:00:35.040 --> 0:00:43.280
Now, can we please welcome Claire Giordano, who's going to speak about Postgres blog posts

10
0:00:43.280 --> 0:00:47.120
and how to give them an outside impact.

11
0:00:47.120 --> 0:00:57.480
I have to get my phone so that I can take a selfie at some point in this talk.

12
0:00:57.480 --> 0:00:58.480
All right.

13
0:00:58.480 --> 0:01:02.480
So, how many of you, is it your first day of FOSDAM or your second?

14
0:01:02.480 --> 0:01:04.800
How many of you are here for your first day of FOSDAM?

15
0:01:04.800 --> 0:01:05.800
Okay.

16
0:01:05.800 --> 0:01:07.560
Most of you were here yesterday.

17
0:01:07.560 --> 0:01:08.560
Yeah.

18
0:01:08.560 --> 0:01:12.120
And I love that it's not freezing cold this year.

19
0:01:12.120 --> 0:01:13.320
It's actually comfortable.

20
0:01:13.320 --> 0:01:14.320
All right.

21
0:01:14.320 --> 0:01:16.600
Well, I thank you for coming.

22
0:01:16.600 --> 0:01:23.160
This is my third FOSDAM, my second time giving a talk here in the Postgres dev room.

23
0:01:23.160 --> 0:01:26.680
Boris, I promise to stay in the proper range now.

24
0:01:26.680 --> 0:01:27.680
Okay.

25
0:01:27.680 --> 0:01:28.680
Am I good?

26
0:01:28.680 --> 0:01:29.680
All right.

27
0:01:29.680 --> 0:01:38.920
So, I'm here to talk to you about how to give your Postgres blog posts an outside impact.

28
0:01:38.920 --> 0:01:45.560
And I'm really happy to talk about it, because sharing information about Postgres and our

29
0:01:45.560 --> 0:01:52.480
projects, new features, new capabilities is just super important to growing the community

30
0:01:52.480 --> 0:01:57.160
and having more people learn about it, use it, become developers on it.

31
0:01:57.160 --> 0:02:03.240
So, before I dive in a bit about my background, I started my career as an engineer in the

32
0:02:03.240 --> 0:02:05.920
developer tools group at Sun Microsystems.

33
0:02:05.920 --> 0:02:11.760
I worked on a predecessor to a predecessor to modern day GitHub and Git.

34
0:02:11.760 --> 0:02:16.720
And then I spent many years as an engineering manager in the kernel group at Sun.

35
0:02:16.720 --> 0:02:21.880
Before moving into product management, product marketing roles, I think of myself as a writer.

36
0:02:21.880 --> 0:02:24.600
That's why I care about blogging.

37
0:02:24.600 --> 0:02:29.200
And about six years ago, I joined a small startup in San Francisco.

38
0:02:29.200 --> 0:02:33.640
Well, not so small, but a startup nonetheless called Citus Data.

39
0:02:33.640 --> 0:02:35.760
Have any of you heard of Citus?

40
0:02:35.760 --> 0:02:36.760
Okay.

41
0:02:36.760 --> 0:02:41.140
So, some of you didn't raise your hands, but I know you've heard of Citus.

42
0:02:41.140 --> 0:02:44.400
And then after a couple of years, we were acquired by Microsoft.

43
0:02:44.400 --> 0:02:51.960
So I work at Microsoft, and this is a screenshot of the GitHub repo for the Citus database

44
0:02:51.960 --> 0:02:58.120
extension, which is an open source extension that I spend most of my days working on.

45
0:02:58.120 --> 0:03:03.040
And I put the screenshot there with the stars over on the right, because I'm on a mission

46
0:03:03.040 --> 0:03:09.640
to make sure people who know it, use it, like it, our supporters of it actually do go and

47
0:03:09.640 --> 0:03:15.120
give it a star so I can bump that number up and get some validation.

48
0:03:15.120 --> 0:03:20.280
So the reason I created this talk is I ran across this quote somewhere where somebody

49
0:03:20.280 --> 0:03:26.120
said about Postgres that it's not just open source, it's open engineering.

50
0:03:26.120 --> 0:03:27.480
And I'm looking at Joe Conway.

51
0:03:27.480 --> 0:03:28.840
Did that quote come from you?

52
0:03:28.840 --> 0:03:30.680
Or was it Peter Eisen trout?

53
0:03:30.680 --> 0:03:33.760
I'm not sure who it was, but it's a fabulous quote.

54
0:03:33.760 --> 0:03:38.120
And so I thought about, well, why not share the techniques and the best practices that

55
0:03:38.120 --> 0:03:45.680
we use, not just in engineering, but in engineering the blog posts and the content that we create.

56
0:03:45.680 --> 0:03:47.840
Now before I dive in, I have to give you a warning.

57
0:03:47.840 --> 0:03:50.600
There's a lot of dog illustrations in this talk.

58
0:03:50.600 --> 0:03:54.920
And that's because I'm here in Brussels and back home in California is my chocolate labrador

59
0:03:54.920 --> 0:03:55.920
named Zuka.

60
0:03:55.920 --> 0:04:00.360
So I don't know, I had to inspire myself to think of her as I was working on it.

61
0:04:00.360 --> 0:04:02.840
Now the talk is going to have two parts.

62
0:04:02.840 --> 0:04:05.160
The first is what you write.

63
0:04:05.160 --> 0:04:08.400
The actual kind of drafting of the blog post.

64
0:04:08.400 --> 0:04:12.680
And the second is where you send it, who you send it to.

65
0:04:12.680 --> 0:04:16.480
And in marketing speak, that means we're going to talk about content and then we're going

66
0:04:16.480 --> 0:04:19.480
to talk about distribution.

67
0:04:19.480 --> 0:04:22.040
Now let's dive into content first.

68
0:04:22.040 --> 0:04:26.880
And in this area, I want to start with you in your frame of mind when you're creating

69
0:04:26.880 --> 0:04:28.440
these blog posts.

70
0:04:28.440 --> 0:04:34.360
And then we'll talk a bit about the edit cycle after that, which is also super important.

71
0:04:34.360 --> 0:04:40.320
And I think my first tip for you when you're creating a blog is to write with a specific

72
0:04:40.320 --> 0:04:41.960
reader in mind.

73
0:04:41.960 --> 0:04:46.280
Now, and think of who's this person that you want to read it?

74
0:04:46.280 --> 0:04:48.080
What kind of skills do they have?

75
0:04:48.080 --> 0:04:49.360
What kind of problems?

76
0:04:49.360 --> 0:04:51.880
See those are those, sorry.

77
0:04:51.880 --> 0:04:53.760
The seats are really loud in here, aren't they?

78
0:04:53.760 --> 0:04:54.760
Yeah, welcome.

79
0:04:54.760 --> 0:04:55.760
I'm glad you're here.

80
0:04:55.760 --> 0:04:58.280
Who do you want to read it?

81
0:04:58.280 --> 0:04:59.280
What are their skills?

82
0:04:59.280 --> 0:05:00.280
What are their interests?

83
0:05:00.280 --> 0:05:02.520
And write to that individual.

84
0:05:02.520 --> 0:05:09.440
This may seem obvious, but for a lot of us, when we try to write to this vague, big, amorphous

85
0:05:09.440 --> 0:05:15.040
world out there, the blog post kind of ends up like hotel food.

86
0:05:15.040 --> 0:05:20.240
And I mean bad, boring hotel food where it's trying to appeal to everybody and doesn't

87
0:05:20.240 --> 0:05:25.480
dare have any strong flavors or strong spices and ends up being very bland.

88
0:05:25.480 --> 0:05:29.840
So write to that specific person as you're creating it.

89
0:05:29.840 --> 0:05:32.240
And then the second tip is also obvious.

90
0:05:32.240 --> 0:05:34.040
Make good topics.

91
0:05:34.040 --> 0:05:38.240
But I put it up there because in many, well there have been many conversations I've had

92
0:05:38.240 --> 0:05:41.720
with people where they've said, you know, I want to start blogging, I want to start

93
0:05:41.720 --> 0:05:45.680
sharing my expertise, but I don't know what to write about.

94
0:05:45.680 --> 0:05:51.880
And so I just want to tell you that the world, the internet is full of inspiration of what

95
0:05:51.880 --> 0:05:52.880
to write about.

96
0:05:52.880 --> 0:05:58.080
And every time you send an internal email answering a question or somebody comes, if

97
0:05:58.080 --> 0:06:03.160
you're working in an office or with a team of people in person, someone comes in and

98
0:06:03.160 --> 0:06:05.000
asks you a question.

99
0:06:05.000 --> 0:06:08.760
Maybe your answer is good fodder for a post.

100
0:06:08.760 --> 0:06:14.120
Maybe more than that person has that question and it should be shared more broadly.

101
0:06:14.120 --> 0:06:21.760
So whether it's Stack Overflow as well or the Postgres Slack, the IRC channel, Reddit,

102
0:06:21.760 --> 0:06:25.200
there's a lot of, there's different subreddits.

103
0:06:25.200 --> 0:06:28.760
There's one for Postgres, but there's other ones that deal with databases and distributed

104
0:06:28.760 --> 0:06:30.160
systems as well.

105
0:06:30.160 --> 0:06:35.400
There's questions that come up there that might make a good blog topic too.

106
0:06:35.400 --> 0:06:37.640
And then just make sure those blogs are interesting.

107
0:06:37.640 --> 0:06:40.880
Like, again, not bland, not boring.

108
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:46.240
Okay, and the third tip when you think about your frame of mind is to have empathy for

109
0:06:46.240 --> 0:06:47.240
your reader.

110
0:06:47.240 --> 0:06:53.000
That's probably the most important takeaway from this talk is to have empathy.

111
0:06:53.000 --> 0:06:54.920
And so what does empathy mean?

112
0:06:54.920 --> 0:06:56.560
It does not mean sympathy.

113
0:06:56.560 --> 0:07:04.160
I love this cartoon from Human Cloud of Gaping Void and on the left he describes empathy

114
0:07:04.160 --> 0:07:06.840
as I feel your pain.

115
0:07:06.840 --> 0:07:09.640
I physically feel how you feel.

116
0:07:09.640 --> 0:07:13.600
I really understand and have empathy for your situation.

117
0:07:13.600 --> 0:07:20.080
Whereas sympathy is just, oh, I'm sorry that you're in pain, which is kind of just words.

118
0:07:20.080 --> 0:07:22.320
It doesn't have the same impact.

119
0:07:22.320 --> 0:07:27.880
So the goal is to have empathy be your true north.

120
0:07:27.880 --> 0:07:31.120
And that means you're going to care about the reader more than you care about yourself.

121
0:07:31.120 --> 0:07:36.840
That means you're going to put in some extra effort in creating the blog post and recognize

122
0:07:36.840 --> 0:07:41.600
that they're busy, they're in a hurry, so you should write and create this post so that

123
0:07:41.600 --> 0:07:45.440
it's easy for them to quickly get answers to their questions.

124
0:07:45.440 --> 0:07:48.260
And just remember that they don't know what you know.

125
0:07:48.260 --> 0:07:52.920
So when you work with a team of people who have similar knowledge, expertise, and skills,

126
0:07:52.920 --> 0:07:54.640
we use a lot of shortcuts.

127
0:07:54.640 --> 0:07:58.680
Like we use acronyms and we don't have to define or explain concepts.

128
0:07:58.680 --> 0:08:00.000
We all understand.

129
0:08:00.000 --> 0:08:04.640
Anybody who works with Citus understands what sharding is, for example.

130
0:08:04.640 --> 0:08:09.560
But the reader doesn't necessarily know what you know, so taking a few moments to define

131
0:08:09.560 --> 0:08:15.360
a term or explain a concept or link to a background blog is super helpful to them.

132
0:08:15.360 --> 0:08:22.840
All right, so let's dive into specific tactics that you can use to apply empathy and really

133
0:08:22.840 --> 0:08:24.360
care about your readers.

134
0:08:24.360 --> 0:08:27.440
And the first is to make your blog posts scannable.

135
0:08:27.440 --> 0:08:33.700
I grabbed these two big, chunky, dense paragraphs from the internet as an example of what you

136
0:08:33.700 --> 0:08:35.400
should not do.

137
0:08:35.400 --> 0:08:37.440
I can't even bring myself to read them.

138
0:08:37.440 --> 0:08:43.220
They're in my talk and I've not read those paragraphs because it's just blah, blah, blah.

139
0:08:43.220 --> 0:08:48.080
My brain cannot embrace whatever they're trying to tell me.

140
0:08:48.080 --> 0:08:53.280
So because people are in a hurry, you've got to make it easy for them to find the part

141
0:08:53.280 --> 0:08:56.120
of the post that will help them.

142
0:08:56.120 --> 0:09:00.080
And one mistake a lot of people make is they...

143
0:09:00.080 --> 0:09:01.080
It's okay.

144
0:09:01.080 --> 0:09:03.160
It's totally okay.

145
0:09:03.160 --> 0:09:08.200
They assume someone's going to read the whole post from the beginning to the end, but they're

146
0:09:08.200 --> 0:09:09.200
not.

147
0:09:09.200 --> 0:09:10.200
They're going to jump around.

148
0:09:10.200 --> 0:09:11.800
Maybe they'll start in the middle.

149
0:09:11.800 --> 0:09:17.080
And so when I think about how to make things scannable, there's a bunch of techniques that

150
0:09:17.080 --> 0:09:20.440
I just wanted to point out that are super useful.

151
0:09:20.440 --> 0:09:26.760
The first is to have section headlines that break up the post, H2s, if you will.

152
0:09:26.760 --> 0:09:29.600
But they should not be subject titles, and we'll talk about that in a moment.

153
0:09:29.600 --> 0:09:33.640
They should actually be headlines, like headlines you'd see in a newspaper.

154
0:09:33.640 --> 0:09:34.640
Use bullets.

155
0:09:34.640 --> 0:09:36.680
Bullets are fabulous for scanning.

156
0:09:36.680 --> 0:09:41.600
If the bullets are multi-line bullets, put a bold font prefix at the beginning of each

157
0:09:41.600 --> 0:09:45.600
one, just like two, three words, that tells them what that bullet is about.

158
0:09:45.600 --> 0:09:50.080
And then most people will just read those bold font prefixes, and they may not read

159
0:09:50.080 --> 0:09:53.360
the rest of it if it's not what they're looking for.

160
0:09:53.360 --> 0:09:56.840
Short sentences and short paragraphs are your friend.

161
0:09:56.840 --> 0:09:59.640
White space is also a big friend.

162
0:09:59.640 --> 0:10:02.360
And then tables are super helpful, too.

163
0:10:02.360 --> 0:10:06.600
I was reviewing a blog post with someone once, and they were sharing just three or four pieces

164
0:10:06.600 --> 0:10:12.000
of performance benchmark data, but they were doing it in sentences, like in the copy.

165
0:10:12.000 --> 0:10:15.960
And when we took those numbers out and we put them in a super small, like, two-by-three

166
0:10:15.960 --> 0:10:21.160
table, all of a sudden the conclusion just popped, whereas before it was hidden in the

167
0:10:21.160 --> 0:10:22.160
paragraphs.

168
0:10:22.160 --> 0:10:29.320
So I just said we'd talk about the section headlines, the H2s, a few seconds ago.

169
0:10:29.320 --> 0:10:31.240
So here's a couple examples.

170
0:10:31.240 --> 0:10:35.520
And these are actual examples from actual blogs that I worked on with people.

171
0:10:35.520 --> 0:10:41.800
And in this first example, literally the H2 said example, which is nice.

172
0:10:41.800 --> 0:10:47.120
It tells you, okay, we're going to look at something that will help show me what we're

173
0:10:47.120 --> 0:10:48.320
talking about.

174
0:10:48.320 --> 0:10:52.960
But in fact, it's much better if it were to say a real-world example, a multi-tenant to-do

175
0:10:52.960 --> 0:10:54.520
application.

176
0:10:54.520 --> 0:10:57.880
It gives more specifics about what's going to be in that section.

177
0:10:57.880 --> 0:11:04.000
Similarly, I was working on a blog post with, I don't even remember who it was with, and

178
0:11:04.000 --> 0:11:06.360
the H2 just said PG Bouncer, which is great.

179
0:11:06.360 --> 0:11:08.880
It tells you that section is about PG Bouncer.

180
0:11:08.880 --> 0:11:09.960
That's useful.

181
0:11:09.960 --> 0:11:14.920
But it's even more useful if we tell you in the H2 that this is about how to set up PG

182
0:11:14.920 --> 0:11:15.920
Bouncer.

183
0:11:15.920 --> 0:11:18.640
And oh, by the way, it's our preferred connection puller.

184
0:11:18.640 --> 0:11:25.440
So just being more specific can help the reader, and it primes their brain as to what they're

185
0:11:25.440 --> 0:11:30.000
going to get or tells them whether to even read that section.

186
0:11:30.000 --> 0:11:32.280
Okay.

187
0:11:32.280 --> 0:11:34.200
Now not everybody is a reader.

188
0:11:34.200 --> 0:11:36.440
So I already said people aren't going to read the whole thing.

189
0:11:36.440 --> 0:11:37.760
They're going to bounce around.

190
0:11:37.760 --> 0:11:41.520
But people's brains process information differently.

191
0:11:41.520 --> 0:11:47.000
So how many of you think of yourselves as being visual in how you process information?

192
0:11:47.000 --> 0:11:48.280
Okay.

193
0:11:48.280 --> 0:11:51.360
And how many of you, when you're explaining something to a colleague, the first thing you

194
0:11:51.360 --> 0:11:54.840
do is jump up to a whiteboard and start sketching diagrams?

195
0:11:54.840 --> 0:11:55.840
Yeah.

196
0:11:55.840 --> 0:11:57.400
Okay.

197
0:11:57.400 --> 0:12:03.120
So to make your blog post more accessible to more people, it shouldn't just be paragraphs

198
0:12:03.120 --> 0:12:04.720
and words and sentences.

199
0:12:04.720 --> 0:12:09.160
But obviously a picture speaks a thousand words, so including a diagram in there and

200
0:12:09.160 --> 0:12:15.560
taking the time to figure out what should that diagram be can make a world of difference.

201
0:12:15.560 --> 0:12:17.640
I gave you the example of tables before.

202
0:12:17.640 --> 0:12:22.560
Those are super helpful when you're sharing numeric information.

203
0:12:22.560 --> 0:12:27.020
For those of us who work on cloud services, sometimes having that screenshot of whatever

204
0:12:27.020 --> 0:12:30.520
is going on in the UI can be really helpful.

205
0:12:30.520 --> 0:12:32.660
And then code blocks as well.

206
0:12:32.660 --> 0:12:35.900
Particularly when you're talking about some new capability or trying to show someone how

207
0:12:35.900 --> 0:12:39.180
to use something, that code block is huge.

208
0:12:39.180 --> 0:12:42.040
So the variety of formats can help.

209
0:12:42.040 --> 0:12:47.440
I took this screenshot, don't worry about it, from a blog post that David Rowley wrote

210
0:12:47.440 --> 0:12:52.680
last year about speeding up sort performance in Postgres 15.

211
0:12:52.680 --> 0:12:58.040
He's one of the Postgres contributors that works on my team at Microsoft.

212
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:01.840
And without this chart, the blog post would have been nice.

213
0:13:01.840 --> 0:13:02.920
It would have been good.

214
0:13:02.920 --> 0:13:09.040
But it was so much more powerful when you show visually what the results were and how

215
0:13:09.040 --> 0:13:13.000
sort performance was sped up.

216
0:13:13.000 --> 0:13:19.600
And when you do include diagrams or charts, it's important to remember to put alt text

217
0:13:19.600 --> 0:13:25.800
in there, not just because we care about people who are visually impaired and are using screen

218
0:13:25.800 --> 0:13:32.680
readers, but also it influences how your blog post will get ranked on search engines.

219
0:13:32.680 --> 0:13:37.680
Because alt text is one of the factors and things that the search engines look for.

220
0:13:37.680 --> 0:13:41.020
Using H2s as well can also help screen readers.

221
0:13:41.020 --> 0:13:45.040
So don't just, when you have those section headlines we talked about earlier, don't just

222
0:13:45.040 --> 0:13:49.960
put a bold font in and make it a bigger font size, actually change the paragraph format

223
0:13:49.960 --> 0:13:55.680
to H2 or section header or whatever it's called in your platform.

224
0:13:55.680 --> 0:13:58.680
And that will help those screen readers too.

225
0:13:58.680 --> 0:14:03.040
The other thing I'll say about this chart is it looked totally different at first.

226
0:14:03.040 --> 0:14:08.400
We iterated on it to try to figure out how do we make the story pop.

227
0:14:08.400 --> 0:14:13.760
We ended up pivoting it by 90 degrees, changing the title, changing how we labeled things

228
0:14:13.760 --> 0:14:17.520
and doing our best to make it drop dead easy to understand.

229
0:14:17.520 --> 0:14:27.040
All right, the third technique in the empathy area that I want to point out is readability.

230
0:14:27.040 --> 0:14:32.560
And I always recommend to people that you write at the third or fifth grade level, maybe

231
0:14:32.560 --> 0:14:34.480
sixth grade is okay.

232
0:14:34.480 --> 0:14:44.760
But a lot of us in engineering were trained to write in very formal, academic, dry tones

233
0:14:44.760 --> 0:14:50.480
of voice and even at the 16th grade level, at the 14th grade level.

234
0:14:50.480 --> 0:14:53.880
And that's hard for people to read, especially when they're in a hurry and trying to get

235
0:14:53.880 --> 0:14:54.960
something done.

236
0:14:54.960 --> 0:14:58.840
So if you simplify your writing that can make a big difference.

237
0:14:58.840 --> 0:15:05.080
This is a screenshot of a tool that I use called the Hemingway app and if you go and

238
0:15:05.080 --> 0:15:09.520
you put copy from your blog post in there, it'll tell you what grade level.

239
0:15:09.520 --> 0:15:14.200
It's written that and will give you some specific suggestions about how you can simplify your

240
0:15:14.200 --> 0:15:15.840
writing.

241
0:15:15.840 --> 0:15:18.520
And that assumes you're writing in English.

242
0:15:18.520 --> 0:15:22.000
I don't know if it has support for other languages.

243
0:15:22.000 --> 0:15:26.680
Other people are big fans of Grammarly and I'm glad you're here.

244
0:15:26.680 --> 0:15:30.280
And so absolutely recommend this.

245
0:15:30.280 --> 0:15:34.280
The other aspect of readability that I want to point out is I always recommend people

246
0:15:34.280 --> 0:15:37.760
write in a conversational tone of voice.

247
0:15:37.760 --> 0:15:46.320
Again, going back to how we were taught to write, it was very formal, pedantic even,

248
0:15:46.320 --> 0:15:48.760
official, academic.

249
0:15:48.760 --> 0:15:53.720
But actually when people are in a hurry, their brains are wired for conversation.

250
0:15:53.720 --> 0:15:59.160
So if you write in that easy, accessible conversational tone of voice, you're going to have more people

251
0:15:59.160 --> 0:16:00.800
recommending your blog post.

252
0:16:00.800 --> 0:16:04.600
You're going to have more people actually reading it versus just bouncing and leaving

253
0:16:04.600 --> 0:16:10.560
deciding oh this is too much work or the worst is I'll read this later, which of course most

254
0:16:10.560 --> 0:16:13.480
people don't ever do.

255
0:16:13.480 --> 0:16:18.040
So part of writing in a conversational tone of voice, like how do you do it?

256
0:16:18.040 --> 0:16:23.520
I always tell people to imagine that they're sitting over coffee and trying to explain

257
0:16:23.520 --> 0:16:28.880
to another engineer or developer how this thing works or whatever the topic is.

258
0:16:28.880 --> 0:16:32.080
And maybe that person is their best friend and they're going for a job interview and

259
0:16:32.080 --> 0:16:34.440
they really need to understand.

260
0:16:34.440 --> 0:16:38.600
How are you going to explain it to them so that it makes sense, so that they get it?

261
0:16:38.600 --> 0:16:43.600
That's the kind of conversational tone of voice that you want to employ.

262
0:16:43.600 --> 0:16:48.080
And then I also recommend people write in the second person you.

263
0:16:48.080 --> 0:16:52.280
And that's because your reader doesn't care about yourself.

264
0:16:52.280 --> 0:16:53.720
They don't care about the author.

265
0:16:53.720 --> 0:16:55.920
They care about themselves.

266
0:16:55.920 --> 0:17:01.520
So when you speak to you, when you write about you, and in the screenshot here I put like

267
0:17:01.520 --> 0:17:06.640
little I don't know if you can see them, oh yes you can, the yellow boxes around all the

268
0:17:06.640 --> 0:17:08.440
instances of the word you.

269
0:17:08.440 --> 0:17:12.500
And a lot of times in the first draft, the word you won't even show up.

270
0:17:12.500 --> 0:17:16.760
People will just say I, I, we, we, I'm doing this, this is all about me.

271
0:17:16.760 --> 0:17:20.440
Kind of like in the beginning of this talk when I introduced myself.

272
0:17:20.440 --> 0:17:21.440
Probably a lot of you didn't care.

273
0:17:21.440 --> 0:17:24.360
You just wanted to get to the meat of the topic.

274
0:17:24.360 --> 0:17:29.440
So speak to you and write in that conversational tone of voice.

275
0:17:29.440 --> 0:17:31.880
So I'm a big fan of Checklist.

276
0:17:31.880 --> 0:17:36.380
I don't know how many of you have read this wonderful book by Atul Gawande called The

277
0:17:36.380 --> 0:17:38.840
Checklist Manifesto.

278
0:17:38.840 --> 0:17:39.840
Anybody?

279
0:17:39.840 --> 0:17:42.040
Oh cool.

280
0:17:42.040 --> 0:17:43.040
I recommend it.

281
0:17:43.040 --> 0:17:48.000
It's a really wonderful book and it talks about using Checklist not just in his field

282
0:17:48.000 --> 0:17:54.600
which is medicine and surgery but also in other fields like airline pilots and people

283
0:17:54.600 --> 0:17:58.600
in charge of big masses like skyscraper construction projects.

284
0:17:58.600 --> 0:18:00.720
Anyway, so a big fan of Checklist.

285
0:18:00.720 --> 0:18:04.960
So here's a Checklist that summarizes the three things we just talked about regarding

286
0:18:04.960 --> 0:18:08.720
scanability, variety of formats, and readability.

287
0:18:08.720 --> 0:18:15.480
All right, and now we're going to pivot away from you and your frame of mind and empathy

288
0:18:15.480 --> 0:18:19.520
and talk about the edit cycle.

289
0:18:19.520 --> 0:18:24.680
So I think the first thing I tell people who are starting off blogging or even experts

290
0:18:24.680 --> 0:18:31.920
who are looking to get better is to just embrace the edit cycle and the iteration.

291
0:18:31.920 --> 0:18:33.920
You have to do the work.

292
0:18:33.920 --> 0:18:36.280
Now I suppose that's not true for everybody.

293
0:18:36.280 --> 0:18:42.560
I do know some people who are kind of famous and they can write really crappy blog posts

294
0:18:42.560 --> 0:18:49.760
and people are going to give it a plus one and promote it and they'll get a lot of traffic

295
0:18:49.760 --> 0:18:52.440
even though it's not actually very helpful, it's not actually very good, but they're

296
0:18:52.440 --> 0:18:55.360
famous and so they get that kind of benefit.

297
0:18:55.360 --> 0:19:01.120
But for most of us mere humans, we've got to do the work to make something usable by

298
0:19:01.120 --> 0:19:02.120
people.

299
0:19:02.120 --> 0:19:07.960
I'm a fan of this writer named David Perrell and I grabbed this screenshot of a tweet that

300
0:19:07.960 --> 0:19:12.960
he did and you don't really need to read the words, but the visual kind of tells the story

301
0:19:12.960 --> 0:19:18.680
that when you are creating a blog and probably the same is true for coding, you end up going

302
0:19:18.680 --> 0:19:22.840
down a lot of dead ends and that's what all those gray lines are meant to represent.

303
0:19:22.840 --> 0:19:26.360
They're things that you thought were going to be part of the blog, ways of explaining

304
0:19:26.360 --> 0:19:29.360
that you thought were going to be useful, but they weren't and you had to throw them

305
0:19:29.360 --> 0:19:30.360
away.

306
0:19:30.360 --> 0:19:36.920
And it's only in, and these are his words, good writing is only obvious in retrospect

307
0:19:36.920 --> 0:19:43.200
and so that purple line could not have been found without all those gray dead ends.

308
0:19:43.200 --> 0:19:47.080
And yeah, so you've got to edit.

309
0:19:47.080 --> 0:19:52.680
The other thing that is important is that it's okay for your first draft to suck.

310
0:19:52.680 --> 0:19:58.280
So especially with people who are creating blogs for the first time, they'll get a little

311
0:19:58.280 --> 0:20:03.320
bit stuck because they're not sure how to say it and they literally, their hands are

312
0:20:03.320 --> 0:20:09.820
frozen over the keyboard and you just have to recognize that dirty little secret that

313
0:20:09.820 --> 0:20:14.440
everybody's first drafts suck and that's okay.

314
0:20:14.440 --> 0:20:18.300
So if you get, once you give yourself permission to write something bad, then you're well on

315
0:20:18.300 --> 0:20:22.440
your way to having a good end result.

316
0:20:22.440 --> 0:20:28.240
So the other quote people often use is perfect is the enemy of the good.

317
0:20:28.240 --> 0:20:32.320
These images of these artists though are kind of interesting because when you think about

318
0:20:32.320 --> 0:20:39.320
artists, because their initial sketches are typically not shared with a team, they feel

319
0:20:39.320 --> 0:20:40.320
free.

320
0:20:40.320 --> 0:20:47.040
They don't have anybody judging them and they can go scribble and draw and experiment and

321
0:20:47.040 --> 0:20:53.600
create some really amazing things by exploring in ways that they wouldn't be able to do if

322
0:20:53.600 --> 0:20:56.860
they felt like they had an audience right there.

323
0:20:56.860 --> 0:21:01.200
So the technique that some people do is they just go, okay, I'm not going to share my first

324
0:21:01.200 --> 0:21:02.200
draft with anybody.

325
0:21:02.200 --> 0:21:06.320
I'm going to wait until it's a second draft and it's a little more refined and maybe that's

326
0:21:06.320 --> 0:21:07.760
what you have to tell yourself.

327
0:21:07.760 --> 0:21:12.400
I just write crappy first drafts and I'm not embarrassed by it because I know the end result

328
0:21:12.400 --> 0:21:15.240
is going to be really freaking good.

329
0:21:15.240 --> 0:21:17.960
All right, feedback is a gift.

330
0:21:17.960 --> 0:21:24.680
So if you find good reviewers, they're gold and say thank you and like have gratitude

331
0:21:24.680 --> 0:21:25.680
for it.

332
0:21:25.680 --> 0:21:31.280
I've worked with some brilliant bloggers in my career who if you ask them to review your

333
0:21:31.280 --> 0:21:33.920
post you'll get, oh yeah, it looks fine, looks pretty good.

334
0:21:33.920 --> 0:21:38.920
You got some typo in the fourth paragraph but other than that it looks good.

335
0:21:38.920 --> 0:21:44.840
That's generally not complete feedback and maybe they didn't even read the thing.

336
0:21:44.840 --> 0:21:50.800
So hopefully you can find people who will look at what's missing or who will give you

337
0:21:50.800 --> 0:21:57.840
specific actionable ideas for how you can improve it or flag the things that are confusing.

338
0:21:57.840 --> 0:22:02.520
Now one of the things I do, particularly when I'm working with folks who are super crazy

339
0:22:02.520 --> 0:22:08.240
busy and who I know are really carving out part of their weekend time or their evening

340
0:22:08.240 --> 0:22:13.460
time to give me feedback is I will ask them to focus on something specific.

341
0:22:13.460 --> 0:22:18.560
So like if you're giving some important post out to three engineers, give them each a different

342
0:22:18.560 --> 0:22:20.360
part, a different assignment.

343
0:22:20.360 --> 0:22:25.520
Hey Joe, I want you to look at the conclusion and make sure I didn't miss anything.

344
0:22:25.520 --> 0:22:30.000
Bertrand, can you look at the diagrams in the middle and make sure that they're clear?

345
0:22:30.000 --> 0:22:34.920
I'm just calling you guys out because you're on the back row so hello.

346
0:22:34.920 --> 0:22:38.140
So giving people those areas of focus can help.

347
0:22:38.140 --> 0:22:43.080
I don't know who to attribute this screenshot here but I have used it with people and it's

348
0:22:43.080 --> 0:22:44.080
super effective.

349
0:22:44.080 --> 0:22:52.800
I'll tell them to flag anything that's confusing, flag anything where their mind starts to wander

350
0:22:52.800 --> 0:22:57.800
because when their mind wanders then that means they're probably bored and I need to

351
0:22:57.800 --> 0:23:01.400
go cut or fix it or do something.

352
0:23:01.400 --> 0:23:07.440
To flag maybe the 10% that they love that I better not throw away in my next edit cycle

353
0:23:07.440 --> 0:23:10.160
and then scribble any ideas for what might be missing.

354
0:23:10.160 --> 0:23:15.340
And people have loved that technique and have said thank you to me for making it easy for

355
0:23:15.340 --> 0:23:17.120
them to help me.

356
0:23:17.120 --> 0:23:24.160
Okay, fifth tip in the edit cycle is just be willing to get your scissors out and to

357
0:23:24.160 --> 0:23:26.160
cut and to cut.

358
0:23:26.160 --> 0:23:30.680
Have any of you ever, are any of you Stephen King fans?

359
0:23:30.680 --> 0:23:36.600
One, two, three, four, half, four and a half.

360
0:23:36.600 --> 0:23:43.740
So Stephen King wrote, I'm actually not a big fan of his horror books but over the years

361
0:23:43.740 --> 0:23:47.760
I've found some of his books that I absolutely love and the one I love the most is called

362
0:23:47.760 --> 0:23:49.760
On Writing.

363
0:23:49.760 --> 0:23:54.320
And we all know if you work in engineering and you work with software that a big part

364
0:23:54.320 --> 0:23:56.160
of your job is communicating, right?

365
0:23:56.160 --> 0:23:58.680
It is explaining things to other people.

366
0:23:58.680 --> 0:24:02.480
So if you've ever wanted to get better at writing that is the book to read and it's

367
0:24:02.480 --> 0:24:08.480
part autobiographical and was written by, well he wrote it as he was recovering from

368
0:24:08.480 --> 0:24:14.280
an accident where he'd been hit by a car but it's part about the craft of writing.

369
0:24:14.280 --> 0:24:19.840
And in it he has a quote that says, kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it

370
0:24:19.840 --> 0:24:25.520
breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.

371
0:24:25.520 --> 0:24:26.720
And I just love that quote.

372
0:24:26.720 --> 0:24:31.880
A lot of people misquoted as kill your babies which I think is rather grotesque but the

373
0:24:31.880 --> 0:24:35.000
idea is you've got to be willing to throw stuff away.

374
0:24:35.000 --> 0:24:39.440
And if you can't bring yourself to throw stuff away and delete it, one of the things I do

375
0:24:39.440 --> 0:24:43.360
is I just put a section at the bottom of the document called the cutting room floor and

376
0:24:43.360 --> 0:24:45.200
I just move stuff down there.

377
0:24:45.200 --> 0:24:47.280
And then I somehow feel better about it.

378
0:24:47.280 --> 0:24:52.660
Like well I'll be able to go back and get it if I decide it really should be reinstated.

379
0:24:52.660 --> 0:24:53.660
That never happens.

380
0:24:53.660 --> 0:24:55.200
It never gets reinstated.

381
0:24:55.200 --> 0:25:01.480
But psychologically putting it in the cutting room floor for me is better than killing it.

382
0:25:01.480 --> 0:25:03.440
But you just got to be willing to cut.

383
0:25:03.440 --> 0:25:07.080
Otherwise people will get bored and they will leave your blog because it will be full of

384
0:25:07.080 --> 0:25:11.560
noise and you won't have enough signal to noise in that ratio.

385
0:25:11.560 --> 0:25:17.480
All right, number six, forking your blog post into several shorter blogs.

386
0:25:17.480 --> 0:25:24.160
So Andres Freund who some of you probably saw, he was here at Fosdom PG Day on Friday

387
0:25:24.160 --> 0:25:26.000
and he's probably around right now.

388
0:25:26.000 --> 0:25:29.120
No, he's probably on his way to the airport.

389
0:25:29.120 --> 0:25:33.440
I worked with him on some blog posts that he wrote over a year ago about connection

390
0:25:33.440 --> 0:25:35.480
scalability and post graphs.

391
0:25:35.480 --> 0:25:40.240
And when he shared the first draft with me, it was really freaking long.

392
0:25:40.240 --> 0:25:42.840
And I didn't even have to tell him that it was long.

393
0:25:42.840 --> 0:25:46.520
He started off with, yeah, maybe I should split this into two different posts.

394
0:25:46.520 --> 0:25:49.840
Well he ended up splitting it into three different posts.

395
0:25:49.840 --> 0:25:54.560
And I think all three of them hit front page hacker news and they all got a ton of traffic

396
0:25:54.560 --> 0:25:56.460
and they were all useful.

397
0:25:56.460 --> 0:26:02.440
And I would argue that having three shorter posts made the information more accessible

398
0:26:02.440 --> 0:26:03.940
to people.

399
0:26:03.940 --> 0:26:08.240
People tend to have shorter amounts of time available to read or to learn.

400
0:26:08.240 --> 0:26:14.320
So this is a technique that can work wonders for you in the edit cycle is to cut things

401
0:26:14.320 --> 0:26:15.360
apart.

402
0:26:15.360 --> 0:26:19.060
And then just keeping it simple, which is really hard to do, especially when you're

403
0:26:19.060 --> 0:26:23.920
trying to explain a concept that's complicated.

404
0:26:23.920 --> 0:26:27.120
But you can keep it simple in a lot of different ways.

405
0:26:27.120 --> 0:26:30.920
Like one of the things you can do is just move certain details into footnotes.

406
0:26:30.920 --> 0:26:35.200
So they're not cluttering your main points, but they're still there.

407
0:26:35.200 --> 0:26:40.340
You can also use analogies to help people understand a difficult concept to make it

408
0:26:40.340 --> 0:26:46.480
easier for them to put that concept that's new to them in a mental model that they already

409
0:26:46.480 --> 0:26:47.480
have.

410
0:26:47.480 --> 0:26:51.120
And then of course writing at that third or fifth grade level will help keep things simple

411
0:26:51.120 --> 0:26:53.200
as well.

412
0:26:53.200 --> 0:26:56.040
And then number eight, reading it out loud.

413
0:26:56.040 --> 0:27:02.440
So it's interesting when I read, and this is true for many people, when I read something

414
0:27:02.440 --> 0:27:08.480
silently in my head, if there's a mistake in it, my brain will self correct it.

415
0:27:08.480 --> 0:27:10.120
And I won't even notice the mistake.

416
0:27:10.120 --> 0:27:13.960
Like it's just, I'll be oblivious to it.

417
0:27:13.960 --> 0:27:16.800
But if I read it out loud, I hear it immediately.

418
0:27:16.800 --> 0:27:18.720
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

419
0:27:18.720 --> 0:27:19.940
I hear it.

420
0:27:19.940 --> 0:27:26.240
So reading out loud is a great way to find errors in what you've written or to find that

421
0:27:26.240 --> 0:27:28.640
it's confusing or long winded.

422
0:27:28.640 --> 0:27:32.680
You've almost run out of breath when you're reading it and you're like, oh, maybe I should

423
0:27:32.680 --> 0:27:35.600
simplify that or shorten it.

424
0:27:35.600 --> 0:27:41.440
It's also a good way to assess if you've written in that conversational tone of voice.

425
0:27:41.440 --> 0:27:46.160
If when you're reading it out loud, you're like, oh, I would never say that.

426
0:27:46.160 --> 0:27:51.480
Well then it's time to get your red pen out and go fix it to make it more conversational.

427
0:27:51.480 --> 0:27:53.200
All right.

428
0:27:53.200 --> 0:27:56.220
So then the nice tip is to optimize for SEO.

429
0:27:56.220 --> 0:28:00.280
So most of you know SEO stands for search engine optimization.

430
0:28:00.280 --> 0:28:06.600
And improving some basic SEO attributes of your post will make it more likely that your

431
0:28:06.600 --> 0:28:10.920
post will show up on that first page of search results.

432
0:28:10.920 --> 0:28:13.400
And you do not need to be an SEO expert at all.

433
0:28:13.400 --> 0:28:18.560
You just need a few very, very basic skills that you can learn today.

434
0:28:18.560 --> 0:28:21.680
And as long as you retain them, you're good to go.

435
0:28:21.680 --> 0:28:27.960
But I have to tell you first that all these few basic SEO tips are not worth your time

436
0:28:27.960 --> 0:28:30.040
if you don't have good content, right?

437
0:28:30.040 --> 0:28:36.360
If it's not scannable, if it's not readable, if you haven't written in a conversational

438
0:28:36.360 --> 0:28:40.240
tone of voice, then the SEO stuff's not going to help you at all.

439
0:28:40.240 --> 0:28:44.240
So starting with good content, there are a few things you can do.

440
0:28:44.240 --> 0:28:50.400
And the first is just to spend a few extra minutes, maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes on the

441
0:28:50.400 --> 0:28:52.600
title.

442
0:28:52.600 --> 0:28:58.760
The title is what's going to cause people to click or not click if they discover or

443
0:28:58.760 --> 0:29:03.720
see your blog post somewhere in search results.

444
0:29:03.720 --> 0:29:10.920
And also the keywords in the title are going to affect on what search results your blog

445
0:29:10.920 --> 0:29:13.040
is going to show up.

446
0:29:13.040 --> 0:29:15.040
Not just the keywords in the title.

447
0:29:15.040 --> 0:29:18.120
Obviously the search engines use a lot of factors.

448
0:29:18.120 --> 0:29:20.180
But it's very, very important.

449
0:29:20.180 --> 0:29:27.480
So what I've found is I have to create at least 15 bad titles to come up with one good

450
0:29:27.480 --> 0:29:28.480
title.

451
0:29:28.480 --> 0:29:33.280
So, and it's interesting because a lot of times when people on my team will create blogs,

452
0:29:33.280 --> 0:29:36.200
they'll literally just create one title.

453
0:29:36.200 --> 0:29:37.760
And that's just the starting point.

454
0:29:37.760 --> 0:29:40.440
They think they're at the finish point, but it's just the starting point.

455
0:29:40.440 --> 0:29:44.420
And then we riff from there to come up with other alternatives.

456
0:29:44.420 --> 0:29:50.520
So this is an example of a screenshot of 15 different titles that Mark Oslott and I were

457
0:29:50.520 --> 0:29:58.240
experimenting with and fiddling with for some blog last October about the Citus 11.1 open

458
0:29:58.240 --> 0:30:00.240
source release.

459
0:30:00.240 --> 0:30:01.840
And it looks like noise.

460
0:30:01.840 --> 0:30:06.160
I probably should have displayed these in categories, but there really is a method to

461
0:30:06.160 --> 0:30:07.480
the madness here.

462
0:30:07.480 --> 0:30:12.720
Like some of these titles use Postgres as well as Citus in the title.

463
0:30:12.720 --> 0:30:14.640
For people who don't know the connection.

464
0:30:14.640 --> 0:30:16.040
It's an important connection.

465
0:30:16.040 --> 0:30:19.720
So maybe the title had to include both.

466
0:30:19.720 --> 0:30:25.120
We were fiddling with different ways to talk about like without blocking rights or without

467
0:30:25.120 --> 0:30:31.420
interruption or how are the other ways, using create distributed table concurrently.

468
0:30:31.420 --> 0:30:34.680
So using different terms to express the same concept.

469
0:30:34.680 --> 0:30:35.800
15 minutes.

470
0:30:35.800 --> 0:30:38.720
I better talk faster, huh?

471
0:30:38.720 --> 0:30:39.720
Okay.

472
0:30:39.720 --> 0:30:40.760
I'll get going.

473
0:30:40.760 --> 0:30:45.760
So the bottom line is don't be afraid to generate a whole bunch of titles and fiddle and experiment

474
0:30:45.760 --> 0:30:49.000
to try to come up with what the right answer is.

475
0:30:49.000 --> 0:30:52.600
Now there's three techniques for assessing once you have a list.

476
0:30:52.600 --> 0:30:56.240
The first is are the most important terms in the first 60 characters.

477
0:30:56.240 --> 0:31:00.920
So on a Google search results page, they will truncate the title after 60 characters.

478
0:31:00.920 --> 0:31:05.040
So don't take the most important word and put it later in the title because then people

479
0:31:05.040 --> 0:31:09.240
are never going to see it and it's not going to cause them to click.

480
0:31:09.240 --> 0:31:12.480
Also just is it boring versus is it interesting?

481
0:31:12.480 --> 0:31:19.720
And I'll often use incognito browser searches to figure out, you know, what other things

482
0:31:19.720 --> 0:31:26.140
are popping up already for those particular search keywords and terms.

483
0:31:26.140 --> 0:31:29.840
And I definitely don't want to use a title that somebody else has already used.

484
0:31:29.840 --> 0:31:31.280
Like that would be a bad thing.

485
0:31:31.280 --> 0:31:35.720
So that's one reason to kind of compare to what's out there in the world.

486
0:31:35.720 --> 0:31:37.000
All right.

487
0:31:37.000 --> 0:31:42.880
And then a few more bullets here on the right-hand side of things to pay attention to.

488
0:31:42.880 --> 0:31:46.880
I will often advise people to avoid general terms like solution.

489
0:31:46.880 --> 0:31:47.960
I can't stand that one.

490
0:31:47.960 --> 0:31:54.480
Like why say solution when you could just say database or Postgres or Citus?

491
0:31:54.480 --> 0:31:58.640
I really pay attention to pronouns like it and this.

492
0:31:58.640 --> 0:32:00.920
A lot of us like to be efficient in our writing.

493
0:32:00.920 --> 0:32:06.440
And so using it makes things sound a little bit less repetitive and I get it.

494
0:32:06.440 --> 0:32:11.880
But almost always that pronoun introduces an ambiguity because it could be referring

495
0:32:11.880 --> 0:32:14.840
to this noun or maybe to that noun.

496
0:32:14.840 --> 0:32:18.640
And for somebody who's in a hurry, it stops them dead in their tracks to try to figure

497
0:32:18.640 --> 0:32:22.120
out what you're referring to and they're not quite sure what you meant.

498
0:32:22.120 --> 0:32:24.020
So that's another tip.

499
0:32:24.020 --> 0:32:31.920
And then I try to when you create hyperlinks, like it's a really bad idea to ever use like

500
0:32:31.920 --> 0:32:37.080
the word here as the anchor text for a hyperlink or anything generic.

501
0:32:37.080 --> 0:32:42.960
You want the anchor text that has the underline under it that links to wherever you're taking

502
0:32:42.960 --> 0:32:48.240
them off site to have very specific and relevant keywords to wherever you're taking them, not

503
0:32:48.240 --> 0:32:50.000
vague and general ones.

504
0:32:50.000 --> 0:32:54.120
And it's actually something that matters to the search engines.

505
0:32:54.120 --> 0:32:59.440
So those are some SEO tips, but I'm going to move on as quickly as I can because there's

506
0:32:59.440 --> 0:33:01.680
more to talk about.

507
0:33:01.680 --> 0:33:04.120
Alt text for graphics, I mentioned that earlier.

508
0:33:04.120 --> 0:33:09.280
And then Google actually also cares about this thing called EAT for author bios.

509
0:33:09.280 --> 0:33:15.460
And that stands for expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.

510
0:33:15.460 --> 0:33:21.280
And so on your blog platform, wherever you publish, make sure that there's a bio description

511
0:33:21.280 --> 0:33:22.520
for you.

512
0:33:22.520 --> 0:33:25.000
And it's always it's nice to make it fun.

513
0:33:25.000 --> 0:33:29.320
In my case, I would say that I love chocolate Labradors or I love sailing in Greece, but

514
0:33:29.320 --> 0:33:33.960
it's even more important to show your expertise and your trustworthiness.

515
0:33:33.960 --> 0:33:37.560
You know, the examples, let's see, do I have two examples here?

516
0:33:37.560 --> 0:33:38.560
Yeah.

517
0:33:38.560 --> 0:33:43.080
So in Marco's case, the second one down, you know, I showed that he has a PhD in distributed

518
0:33:43.080 --> 0:33:46.860
systems and that he's the lead engineer on the site of his database team.

519
0:33:46.860 --> 0:33:49.480
And also like what conferences he's spoken at.

520
0:33:49.480 --> 0:33:54.640
Apparently the EAT team of reviewers care a lot about conference talks.

521
0:33:54.640 --> 0:33:58.140
That's one of the ways they decide somebody is credible in a field.

522
0:33:58.140 --> 0:34:04.400
For Thomas Monroe, who's another Postgres engineer on our team, again, list what conferences

523
0:34:04.400 --> 0:34:09.920
that he spoke at and the fact that, you know, he's a core developer, et cetera, et cetera.

524
0:34:09.920 --> 0:34:12.320
OK, so again, another checklist.

525
0:34:12.320 --> 0:34:17.760
I will be publishing my slides afterwards, so you'll be able to grab these if you find

526
0:34:17.760 --> 0:34:20.040
them useful.

527
0:34:20.040 --> 0:34:26.400
And I think I've got all of the editing tips here as well as the SEO tips.

528
0:34:26.400 --> 0:34:27.480
Cool?

529
0:34:27.480 --> 0:34:32.480
So now we're done with content, both you as well as the edit cycle.

530
0:34:32.480 --> 0:34:36.920
And I want to talk for just a few minutes on distribution, which is kind of how do you

531
0:34:36.920 --> 0:34:37.920
publish?

532
0:34:37.920 --> 0:34:41.440
So first I want to ask a question, which is somebody said this to me once.

533
0:34:41.440 --> 0:34:45.680
We're going to know which blog posts are good by how much traffic they get.

534
0:34:45.680 --> 0:34:46.680
True?

535
0:34:46.680 --> 0:34:47.680
Show of hands?

536
0:34:47.680 --> 0:34:48.680
False.

537
0:34:48.680 --> 0:34:50.680
Show of hands.

538
0:34:50.680 --> 0:34:53.200
OK, so it's false.

539
0:34:53.200 --> 0:35:00.880
Like, typically how much traffic something gets is more a factor of how much was it shared?

540
0:35:00.880 --> 0:35:02.560
How much was it promoted?

541
0:35:02.560 --> 0:35:07.200
Did you actually distribute it and get it out into the world?

542
0:35:07.200 --> 0:35:11.160
Distribution trumps content almost all of the time.

543
0:35:11.160 --> 0:35:17.480
So there's two aspects of distribution, the publishing platform itself, which you need

544
0:35:17.480 --> 0:35:20.720
to be smart about that, but we're not going to talk about that today.

545
0:35:20.720 --> 0:35:25.080
We'll focus instead on how to promote your blog posts.

546
0:35:25.080 --> 0:35:30.520
So one pro tip I always share with people is as soon as you publish, but before you

547
0:35:30.520 --> 0:35:35.840
start sharing it, before anybody starts sharing it, double check what I call the unfurl of

548
0:35:35.840 --> 0:35:38.480
that URL.

549
0:35:38.480 --> 0:35:39.760
That might be a slack term.

550
0:35:39.760 --> 0:35:41.800
So I'm sure there's another term for it.

551
0:35:41.800 --> 0:35:47.400
But basically, when you share your URL on different platforms, the HTML metadata will

552
0:35:47.400 --> 0:35:48.400
get displayed, right?

553
0:35:48.400 --> 0:35:53.800
The HTML title, the HTML description, as is here, title, description, as well as the OG

554
0:35:53.800 --> 0:35:54.800
image, right?

555
0:35:54.800 --> 0:35:57.240
Or the social graphic, or the teaser graphic.

556
0:35:57.240 --> 0:36:00.480
Different blog platforms call it different things.

557
0:36:00.480 --> 0:36:03.960
And sometimes people have screwed up and they have the wrong graphic or they didn't fix

558
0:36:03.960 --> 0:36:05.200
their description.

559
0:36:05.200 --> 0:36:09.480
And then some of these social platforms cache the graphic in particular.

560
0:36:09.480 --> 0:36:14.960
So if you notice the mistake seconds after you tweet it out the first time, Twitter is

561
0:36:14.960 --> 0:36:20.040
going to cache that graphic for 24 to 48 hours and you can fix it, but people are still going

562
0:36:20.040 --> 0:36:21.920
to see the wrong one.

563
0:36:21.920 --> 0:36:25.760
So it's just worth double checking that before you start sharing.

564
0:36:25.760 --> 0:36:31.080
And then I always put a plug in for Planet Postgrass if your blog is about Postgrass

565
0:36:31.080 --> 0:36:37.700
and it complies with all of the Planet Postgrass policies, syndicating it there is a great

566
0:36:37.700 --> 0:36:43.480
way to get it into people's RSS feeds and also you'll see on the right here that there's

567
0:36:43.480 --> 0:36:48.600
a Planet Postgrass Twitter account and on Mastodon there's a Planet Postgrass unofficial

568
0:36:48.600 --> 0:36:50.200
bot account too.

569
0:36:50.200 --> 0:36:56.000
And so then you can, people follow that account on Mastodon or on Twitter and it's another

570
0:36:56.000 --> 0:36:57.400
way to reach people.

571
0:36:57.400 --> 0:36:59.400
So that's a fabulous way to reach people.

572
0:36:59.400 --> 0:37:02.880
And the bottom line thing is just go to where your readers are.

573
0:37:02.880 --> 0:37:07.840
And so what that means for me and our team is that we end up sharing our blog posts on

574
0:37:07.840 --> 0:37:14.880
pretty much all of these different social platforms because there's no one social platform

575
0:37:14.880 --> 0:37:16.840
that everybody subscribes to.

576
0:37:16.840 --> 0:37:18.880
And did I add Mastodon to this list?

577
0:37:18.880 --> 0:37:22.400
No, I need to update this and add Mastodon.

578
0:37:22.400 --> 0:37:24.840
I created this slide back in October.

579
0:37:24.840 --> 0:37:26.940
Things were a little bit different back then.

580
0:37:26.940 --> 0:37:33.060
But actually on most of these slides I have my Mastodon account is now listed.

581
0:37:33.060 --> 0:37:39.080
So Twitter is just the Claire Jordan a bit but I'm on hackyderm.io which I probably mispronounced.

582
0:37:39.080 --> 0:37:42.400
Okay, another tip, rinse, lather, repeat.

583
0:37:42.400 --> 0:37:46.920
And that just means if you're going to share it, don't be afraid to share it a few times,

584
0:37:46.920 --> 0:37:48.960
at different times of day.

585
0:37:48.960 --> 0:37:54.760
The Postgrass audience is global and something that you tweet in the morning in Europe is

586
0:37:54.760 --> 0:38:01.520
not going to reach people in California necessarily unless they're super night owls and vice versa.

587
0:38:01.520 --> 0:38:05.880
So I know a bunch of engineers were like, oh, I already tweeted it once.

588
0:38:05.880 --> 0:38:09.760
I don't want to pollute my profile with it more than once.

589
0:38:09.760 --> 0:38:15.200
But if you want to reach your friends, you're going to have to hit different time zones.

590
0:38:15.200 --> 0:38:20.200
And just keep in mind that only like one statistically, only one to 2% of your Twitter followers would

591
0:38:20.200 --> 0:38:21.600
see a given tweet.

592
0:38:21.600 --> 0:38:24.920
I don't actually know what that statistic is on Mastodon.

593
0:38:24.920 --> 0:38:27.600
Yeah, Devram, do you want me to go faster?

594
0:38:27.600 --> 0:38:35.400
Yeah, the number may be lower now.

595
0:38:35.400 --> 0:38:39.580
Things are definitely changing in the Twitter world.

596
0:38:39.580 --> 0:38:43.180
An example of rinse, lather, repeat too.

597
0:38:43.180 --> 0:38:48.040
Some of my colleagues, my boss actually, was interviewed on Azure Friday which is this

598
0:38:48.040 --> 0:38:53.960
wonderful video show put on by Scott Hanselman who I think is a fabulous human being.

599
0:38:53.960 --> 0:39:00.600
And the person in charge of the Azure Friday show tweeted about it multiple times but with

600
0:39:00.600 --> 0:39:03.720
different graphics each time and different words each time.

601
0:39:03.720 --> 0:39:07.920
And I actually think that's a good technique because the different graphics are bound to

602
0:39:07.920 --> 0:39:09.720
appeal to different people.

603
0:39:09.720 --> 0:39:16.080
I mean, I suppose it's not unlike Netflix having different graphics that they use to

604
0:39:16.080 --> 0:39:21.320
promote a movie and something that appeals to Boris is not necessarily going to be what

605
0:39:21.320 --> 0:39:22.560
appeals to me.

606
0:39:22.560 --> 0:39:27.000
So I bet we see different graphics for these various shows.

607
0:39:27.000 --> 0:39:31.400
All right, and you can keep your Twitter momentum by recycling tweets.

608
0:39:31.400 --> 0:39:33.400
The same is true on Mastodon as well.

609
0:39:33.400 --> 0:39:38.640
So just, you know, you can quote tweet on Twitter and not on Mastodon yet.

610
0:39:38.640 --> 0:39:42.520
Your mileage may vary but it's super effective.

611
0:39:42.520 --> 0:39:45.680
And also having other people on the team share it.

612
0:39:45.680 --> 0:39:52.440
So for example, let's see, I think Devroom took something that I tweeted recently and

613
0:39:52.440 --> 0:39:56.360
then he quote tweeted it and it reached a ton more people as a result.

614
0:39:56.360 --> 0:40:02.480
So just keep recycling it and eventually you will hit more people.

615
0:40:02.480 --> 0:40:05.560
On Reddit, it's super important to be there for the Q&A.

616
0:40:05.560 --> 0:40:10.200
Like most of the moderators will say that one-way promotion is considered advertising.

617
0:40:10.200 --> 0:40:14.920
They don't like that and then you can end up getting blocked by the mods explicitly

618
0:40:14.920 --> 0:40:18.880
or by the bots, you know, sometimes by mistake.

619
0:40:18.880 --> 0:40:22.520
And so, but if you go in there and you make a comment and you say, hey, we're here to

620
0:40:22.520 --> 0:40:28.600
answer questions, let's discuss this and you facilitate a conversation, that's quite welcome.

621
0:40:28.600 --> 0:40:31.600
And so, but then you have to be willing to participate.

622
0:40:31.600 --> 0:40:35.920
And there were a ton of questions on this particular topic when we open sourced Citus

623
0:40:35.920 --> 0:40:37.120
last year.

624
0:40:37.120 --> 0:40:40.800
And so Yelta had a lot of work to do to get answers to those questions.

625
0:40:40.800 --> 0:40:42.960
Five minutes left.

626
0:40:42.960 --> 0:40:45.520
Number seven is that Karma is a two-way street.

627
0:40:45.520 --> 0:40:52.160
So if you want your Postgres colleagues or people who work on the same team as you to

628
0:40:52.160 --> 0:41:00.280
help spread the word on some blog post that you've written, turn the table around and

629
0:41:00.280 --> 0:41:04.880
help them when they've got something new and that they're publishing and they're trying

630
0:41:04.880 --> 0:41:06.960
to get it out there.

631
0:41:06.960 --> 0:41:10.440
And that's something that I think we all should do more of.

632
0:41:10.440 --> 0:41:19.320
The more we help amplify each other's work on Postgres and on Citus, the more people

633
0:41:19.320 --> 0:41:24.200
will discover what's going on, learn about it, become an expert in it and join the community.

634
0:41:24.200 --> 0:41:26.640
Again, another set of tips.

635
0:41:26.640 --> 0:41:30.600
And here for promotion, your checklist, like your mileage is going to vary.

636
0:41:30.600 --> 0:41:35.060
So I didn't give an explicit checklist because what you want to do is going to be different

637
0:41:35.060 --> 0:41:38.720
based on whatever part of the database you're working on.

638
0:41:38.720 --> 0:41:42.160
So you'll have to create your own promotion checklist, but hopefully these tips will be

639
0:41:42.160 --> 0:41:43.280
helpful.

640
0:41:43.280 --> 0:41:48.480
And I put it all together here because the devil is in the details and there is a lot

641
0:41:48.480 --> 0:41:50.160
to do.

642
0:41:50.160 --> 0:41:54.880
And if there's one thing you're going to remember from this talk today, it should be to have

643
0:41:54.880 --> 0:41:55.880
empathy for your readers.

644
0:41:55.880 --> 0:42:00.520
And if you do that, you're more likely to write in a conversational tone of voice, speak

645
0:42:00.520 --> 0:42:07.680
to you, make things scannable, readable, simple, take the time to explain things, prioritize

646
0:42:07.680 --> 0:42:10.640
and care about your reader more than you care about yourself.

647
0:42:10.640 --> 0:42:15.240
There were a whole bunch of people who helped me and inspired me in writing this talk, so

648
0:42:15.240 --> 0:42:18.840
I had to throw that slide up there to thank them.

649
0:42:18.840 --> 0:42:24.160
And there is a feedback link for all of the talks here in the Postgres dev room.

650
0:42:24.160 --> 0:42:29.920
So if you go into FOSTEM.org, 2023 schedule, and you go to the Postgres dev room track,

651
0:42:29.920 --> 0:42:33.560
you can see all of our talks listed and you can click on any one of them.

652
0:42:33.560 --> 0:42:36.560
And in the bottom left, there's a submit feedback link.

653
0:42:36.560 --> 0:42:40.480
And I don't know how many of you generally give feedback on your FOSTEM talk.

654
0:42:40.480 --> 0:42:42.560
Show of hands.

655
0:42:42.560 --> 0:42:44.120
Okay.

656
0:42:44.120 --> 0:42:46.960
Let's try to increase that number this year.

657
0:42:46.960 --> 0:42:48.220
Because it's super helpful.

658
0:42:48.220 --> 0:42:52.560
People pour a lot of energy into creating these talks and organizing the dev room, and

659
0:42:52.560 --> 0:42:55.440
we would love to get your feedback.

660
0:42:55.440 --> 0:42:59.440
I put my addresses up there on Mastodon and on Twitter.

661
0:42:59.440 --> 0:43:04.680
If any of you want to follow me, I will be posting a link to the slides on both of those

662
0:43:04.680 --> 0:43:11.920
accounts and I put the CITIS GitHub repo on there, too, so that if it is something that

663
0:43:11.920 --> 0:43:15.640
you appreciate, you can be sure to drop it a star as well.

664
0:43:15.640 --> 0:43:18.000
And then I know that we need to move on to the next talk.

665
0:43:18.000 --> 0:43:19.480
I think I'm out of time.

666
0:43:19.480 --> 0:43:20.480
So I don't know.

667
0:43:20.480 --> 0:43:21.480
Do we have any time for questions?

668
0:43:21.480 --> 0:43:22.480
Okay.

669
0:43:22.480 --> 0:43:24.360
So we have a few minutes for questions.

670
0:43:24.360 --> 0:43:31.240
I also wanted to say that I have some Postgres and some CITIS database socks up here.

671
0:43:31.240 --> 0:43:32.240
I have 40 pairs.

672
0:43:32.240 --> 0:43:38.680
I also have a whole bunch of stickers of the CITIS open source mascot, too.

673
0:43:38.680 --> 0:43:43.280
So feel free to come and get them afterwards and wear them in good health.

674
0:43:43.280 --> 0:43:45.040
But first questions?

675
0:43:45.040 --> 0:43:46.040
Any?

676
0:43:46.040 --> 0:44:01.880
So, great talk.

677
0:44:01.880 --> 0:44:07.000
Many folks have strong opinions about certain things to a point like some people take religiously

678
0:44:07.000 --> 0:44:08.000
certain stuff.

679
0:44:08.000 --> 0:44:13.080
And when you are in the edit cycle, would you eliminate such pieces of information that

680
0:44:13.080 --> 0:44:20.400
will cause a sparking reaction from such folks, or would you let the disagreement ensue because

681
0:44:20.400 --> 0:44:23.200
knowing that disagreement is information?

682
0:44:23.200 --> 0:44:27.560
So what should one do in such certain situation when they want to have such pieces of information

683
0:44:27.560 --> 0:44:29.080
in their blog post?

684
0:44:29.080 --> 0:44:30.800
I think that's a really good question.

685
0:44:30.800 --> 0:44:35.800
So where's the line between having an opinion on something, right?

686
0:44:35.800 --> 0:44:41.520
An opinion that might be unique in your own and being offensive perhaps to other groups

687
0:44:41.520 --> 0:44:44.160
or hurtful or overly critical.

688
0:44:44.160 --> 0:44:48.240
And I kind of use the code of conduct as my guide.

689
0:44:48.240 --> 0:44:55.000
How far have I stepped from expressing my opinion into trashing somebody else's opinion?

690
0:44:55.000 --> 0:44:59.200
I think I'd fall back on that.

691
0:44:59.200 --> 0:45:02.480
Other questions?

692
0:45:02.480 --> 0:45:06.880
There's one behind you, Jimmy.

693
0:45:06.880 --> 0:45:12.760
It's a small question, but what's the different tips you can say about presenting something

694
0:45:12.760 --> 0:45:15.680
in your team to your colleagues, whatever?

695
0:45:15.680 --> 0:45:22.720
It's not blogging something, but still it's a lot of things you mentioned here and etc.

696
0:45:22.720 --> 0:45:25.760
Maybe you have some tips there as well to say.

697
0:45:25.760 --> 0:45:30.840
I do, but there's no way I could answer that question succinctly in the time that we have.

698
0:45:30.840 --> 0:45:36.160
But I will say that a lot of these same tips about communicating in the format of a blog

699
0:45:36.160 --> 0:45:42.120
also make a lot of sense in the format of a presentation, right?

700
0:45:42.120 --> 0:45:46.920
It's just, for example, the white space that I talked about in your blog, that breathing

701
0:45:46.920 --> 0:45:50.480
room, it's the pause when you're giving a talk.

702
0:45:50.480 --> 0:45:55.280
It's the taking a moment to speak slowly when you're giving a talk, for example.

703
0:45:55.280 --> 0:46:00.440
I also a big fan of spreading things out on multiple slides so that any one slide only

704
0:46:00.440 --> 0:46:03.600
says one thing versus having a lot of noise up there.

705
0:46:03.600 --> 0:46:07.880
So the signal to noise ratio lesson is the same in both too.

706
0:46:07.880 --> 0:46:09.200
Okay.

707
0:46:09.200 --> 0:46:10.200
Another question.

708
0:46:10.200 --> 0:46:11.200
Hey.

709
0:46:11.200 --> 0:46:14.960
Oh, and just be careful with the seats, people, when you sit down.

710
0:46:14.960 --> 0:46:16.360
It's very loud.

711
0:46:16.360 --> 0:46:17.360
Go for it.

712
0:46:17.360 --> 0:46:22.080
So I'm a personal blogger and let's say I don't have all the resources to promote on

713
0:46:22.080 --> 0:46:28.320
all the possible websites, radio, hacker news, post to Twitter.

714
0:46:28.320 --> 0:46:35.000
So if I can choose, let's say, two or three major promotion resources, what's your advice

715
0:46:35.000 --> 0:46:36.480
for choosing them?

716
0:46:36.480 --> 0:46:40.080
Which social platforms to pick if you only have time to publish on a few of them?

717
0:46:40.080 --> 0:46:41.080
Is that the question?

718
0:46:41.080 --> 0:46:42.080
Yeah.

719
0:46:42.080 --> 0:46:44.600
Like, shall I choose radio, hacker news, or things like that?

720
0:46:44.600 --> 0:46:46.280
I can't prescribe that for you.

721
0:46:46.280 --> 0:46:49.180
What I would recommend is that you experiment, right?

722
0:46:49.180 --> 0:46:54.560
Because it depends on where your friends are, who your customers and users are, where they

723
0:46:54.560 --> 0:46:55.560
are.

724
0:46:55.560 --> 0:47:00.640
And that advice about go to where your audience is, that's where you need to go.

725
0:47:00.640 --> 0:47:06.520
And so you might try these two first and then try these two another time.

726
0:47:06.520 --> 0:47:12.640
I also don't think I would just give a particular social platform one chance because it might

727
0:47:12.640 --> 0:47:17.080
be the right platform for you, but you post it at the wrong time of day or the wrong day

728
0:47:17.080 --> 0:47:18.200
of week.

729
0:47:18.200 --> 0:47:21.560
So I think you're just going to have to experiment a little bit there.

730
0:47:21.560 --> 0:47:23.160
Thank you.

731
0:47:23.160 --> 0:47:24.840
Any other questions or are we out of time, Jimmy?

732
0:47:24.840 --> 0:47:28.360
No, we've got three, two minutes?

733
0:47:28.360 --> 0:47:30.360
Okay.

734
0:47:30.360 --> 0:47:33.080
Karen has a question.

735
0:47:33.080 --> 0:47:37.760
I'll repeat the question if you want.

736
0:47:37.760 --> 0:47:40.920
Hey, thank you very much.

737
0:47:40.920 --> 0:47:47.040
I didn't manage to catch your talk last time you did it, so I'm really glad I was here

738
0:47:47.040 --> 0:47:48.040
today.

739
0:47:48.040 --> 0:47:52.920
Lots of us in IT, from speaking to many people, don't find it natural to promote ourselves

740
0:47:52.920 --> 0:48:01.240
or to put ourselves out there and write blog posts and promote our tweets and things.

741
0:48:01.240 --> 0:48:05.080
Have you got specific advice for that?

742
0:48:05.080 --> 0:48:06.640
That is a really good question.

743
0:48:06.640 --> 0:48:11.640
And I struggle with it because it's back to why I made that karma point, too.

744
0:48:11.640 --> 0:48:17.080
Sometimes people also have trouble promoting their teammates' work because that might be

745
0:48:17.080 --> 0:48:19.840
seen as too self-serving also.

746
0:48:19.840 --> 0:48:25.720
But the fact is, if we want the Postgres community to grow, if we want the information

747
0:48:25.720 --> 0:48:30.920
that we're sharing to get out there, then we kind of do have to promote it.

748
0:48:30.920 --> 0:48:38.280
And I don't know how to really address that concern except to suggest that you just have

749
0:48:38.280 --> 0:48:40.320
to let it go.

750
0:48:40.320 --> 0:48:41.400
We just have to do it.

751
0:48:41.400 --> 0:48:43.880
You have to see it as part of the job.

752
0:48:43.880 --> 0:48:46.560
It does become more comfortable over time.

753
0:48:46.560 --> 0:48:50.040
It's not unlike anything with practice.

754
0:48:50.040 --> 0:48:51.440
And you know what will happen?

755
0:48:51.440 --> 0:48:56.120
When you promote something and you get the feedback from someone, Pavlo sends you a note

756
0:48:56.120 --> 0:48:58.400
and says, hey, that was really useful.

757
0:48:58.400 --> 0:49:00.920
I especially like the bit about this.

758
0:49:00.920 --> 0:49:05.080
And then your brain starts to connect the dots like, oh, Pavlo wouldn't have even known

759
0:49:05.080 --> 0:49:07.200
about it if I hadn't shared it.

760
0:49:07.200 --> 0:49:09.320
Okay, maybe sharing is a good thing.

761
0:49:09.320 --> 0:49:10.320
I don't know.

762
0:49:10.320 --> 0:49:14.800
So you get the positive validation and that might help.

763
0:49:14.800 --> 0:49:16.880
Any other questions?

764
0:49:16.880 --> 0:49:19.520
Very, very quick.

765
0:49:19.520 --> 0:49:23.640
How to cope with imposter syndrome?

766
0:49:23.640 --> 0:49:27.040
Because it's something I feel and I think about Brian.

767
0:49:27.040 --> 0:49:30.120
How to cope with imposter syndrome is the question.

768
0:49:30.120 --> 0:49:32.200
And it's a really good question.

769
0:49:32.200 --> 0:49:38.160
I think a lot more people feel imposter syndrome than we realize.

770
0:49:38.160 --> 0:49:42.840
I bet there's a lot of speakers here at FOSDIM who are experts in their field that maybe

771
0:49:42.840 --> 0:49:47.640
felt like imposters as they were walking into the building today and wondering why they're

772
0:49:47.640 --> 0:49:50.000
the ones giving the talk.

773
0:49:50.000 --> 0:49:54.160
I'm not a psychologist, so I don't think I have a good answer except to say that you're

774
0:49:54.160 --> 0:49:55.760
not alone.

775
0:49:55.760 --> 0:50:01.400
And everybody has a story to tell and everybody has a unique point of view and lessons and

776
0:50:01.400 --> 0:50:24.100
ria and just share.
