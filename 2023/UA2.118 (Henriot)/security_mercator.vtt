WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Hi there, I'm a technology information security

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
enthusiast. I start my career as an information security

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
ninja defending information against cyber threat using my

00:26.000 --> 00:30.760
out at night, that of a beloved hacker, I love using my skills to support the value

00:30.760 --> 00:34.240
of open source and fairly believe in it.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.240
I believe that technology can be used to improve people's life, but it can only be done if

00:39.240 --> 00:42.720
we work together and share our knowledge.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.440
That's why I'm also a strong advocate of collaboration and openness in the technology industry.

00:48.440 --> 00:53.760
So may the open source be with you.

00:53.760 --> 00:59.440
I will present a project we have made at the hospital where I work during the COVID crisis.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.080
Hospital information system is really complex.

01:02.080 --> 01:09.200
It's more than 3,000 applications, 4,000 virtual machines, 2,000 people working in

01:09.200 --> 01:16.000
a critical infrastructure, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day to save people's lives.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.760
To secure this environment, we need a global view of all elements that compose the information

01:20.760 --> 01:26.480
system to obtain a better readability and thus a better control.

01:26.480 --> 01:32.080
So we start to build a cartography based on the NC guide mapping the information system.

01:32.080 --> 01:38.760
But when we look at four tools, we didn't find one that fills our needs.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.760
Then the COVID crisis comes, all IT projects were stopped or at least slowed down.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.520
So we took this time to work these tools Mercator.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.560
Mercator helps organizations mapping the information system in order for them to meet the operational

01:52.560 --> 01:55.080
requirements of cybersecurity.

01:55.080 --> 01:58.560
It helps to build a map in five simple practical steps.

01:58.560 --> 02:05.880
It can be used by any organization irrespective of the type, size, maturity, in terms of cybersecurity

02:05.880 --> 02:09.120
or complexity of the information system.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.120
It's an open source.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.800
It can be used by any organization in public or private sector alike.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
So what is Mercator?

02:16.800 --> 02:20.680
Mercator is a web application that allows you to manage the mapping or the information

02:20.680 --> 02:26.200
system as described in the information system mapping guide from the NC.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
What is mapping?

02:27.200 --> 02:32.240
Mapping is a way to represent the information system of an organization as well as its connection

02:32.240 --> 02:35.440
with the outside world.

02:35.440 --> 02:41.200
The term mapping refers to a schematic representation of a set of informations.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.280
Mapping is different from inventory.

02:43.280 --> 02:49.080
Typically, you manage your assets in different inventory, but you don't know the relations

02:49.080 --> 02:54.000
between them and the importance of relations between all the information.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.360
In mapping, we will try to have a complete view from the outside world, from business

02:59.360 --> 03:05.040
requirements, down to your application, your servers, and your physical inventories and

03:05.040 --> 03:08.080
your IT rooms.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
So Mercator is a cartographer.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.560
Mercator is a author of the Mercator projection, which is a conformal projection.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
It keeps angles.

03:14.560 --> 03:20.320
It's very useful in the sailing in the safety centers.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
Why mapping?

03:21.320 --> 03:24.880
Mapping is essential to control the information system.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.520
It's allowed to have a knowledge of all the components of your information system and

03:28.520 --> 03:34.280
to obtain a better understanding of it by presenting it in the different view.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.240
It's allowed to fulfill the fourth challenge of digital security.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.440
It's to control the information system.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.280
The cartography allows you to have a common and shared vision of the information system

03:44.280 --> 03:46.560
within the organization.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.920
It protects the information system.

03:48.920 --> 03:54.320
Mercator mapping makes it possible to identify the most critical and most exposed system,

03:54.320 --> 03:58.920
to anticipate possible attack paths on this system, and to implement an adequate measure

03:58.920 --> 04:01.760
to ensure their protections.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.760
The defense of the information systems, mapping makes a more effective response in an event

04:06.760 --> 04:11.960
of an incident or a digital attack to qualify the impact and predict the consequence of

04:11.960 --> 04:14.760
the different actions taken.

04:14.760 --> 04:19.640
And then the information system resilience, mapping make it possible to identify the organization's

04:19.640 --> 04:27.120
key activities to define the business continuity plan and use essential tools for crazies management

04:27.120 --> 04:34.040
whether they are digital or not.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.480
The map is composed of three main assets.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.400
It's defined in different view.

04:40.400 --> 04:46.920
First, you have your ecosystem view that represents the entities of the system which use the information

04:46.920 --> 04:49.120
interact to fulfill these functions.

04:49.120 --> 04:55.280
These are your providers, your partners, your customers.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.280
Then you have the business view of the information system that presents the information through

04:59.280 --> 05:01.240
the main process and information.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.680
So, then all your processes, your activities, your actors.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.440
Then you have the application view that describes the software components of this information

05:09.440 --> 05:15.160
system, the service they provide, and the flow of information between them.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.680
Then you have the administration view.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.560
This is the list of scope and privilege of users and administrators.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.520
You have the infrastructure, the logical infrastructure view illustrates network partitioning, including

05:27.520 --> 05:32.000
the definitions for IP address, VLANs, filtering and routing functions.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.720
And then you have the physical infrastructure that describes the physical equipment that

05:35.720 --> 05:39.800
are used by the information system.

05:39.800 --> 05:46.400
Your mapping can be built in three steps.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.840
And each of these steps, they have a level of granularity which will fulfill some of

05:51.840 --> 05:54.440
this information or some of these objects.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.640
To be migrated to level one, you have also initial element essential for digital operations,

05:59.640 --> 06:01.440
for security operations.

06:01.440 --> 06:07.400
At level two, the second level of granularity, you have the digital security oriented for

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
the mapping.

06:08.400 --> 06:14.280
The digital information system must have a mapping which is at minimum at this level.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.120
And at level three, you have the fine ability.

06:16.120 --> 06:23.680
You have a comprehensive data mapping that incorporates all digital security requirements.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.000
This is the main screen of the applications.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.760
We have on the top the different materials or three materials levels.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.200
You have a breakdown of all your object by domain.

06:32.200 --> 06:39.640
And then you have all global proportional view of all those assets of your cartography.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.800
We have on the left on the top your subpanel.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.560
Top on the top panel your views, previous documentation.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.920
And on the left panel, all the data entry.

06:48.920 --> 06:53.080
Mercator computes the maturity level.

06:53.080 --> 06:59.960
An item, an asset in the cartography is complete if we have all the information, all the related

06:59.960 --> 07:04.560
information within them with other assets.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.440
For example, an asset in the cartography is not confirmed.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.040
There is no distribution, no responsibility, no type.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.440
Or there is no link between other assets.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.920
For example, an entity without relations, a process without operation.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.440
An application does not support any process or a server without applications.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.440
They need to compute the maturity level, that is, the conforming asset divided by the total

07:28.440 --> 07:29.840
number of assets.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.120
And the percentage represents the effort to be compliant.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.360
So the more, the better.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.520
So we have a lot of lists.

07:38.520 --> 07:42.800
In the asset, we have about 20 different types of assets.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.600
And you can show all types of assets.

07:44.600 --> 07:49.240
You can sort, export them, hide and colon, copy.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.000
You have a lot of form to fulfill.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.120
So which form is the STF?

07:55.120 --> 07:56.720
You can define the link between object.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.480
There is a role management within that is implemented within Mercator.

08:00.480 --> 08:08.080
You find that you can define within your IT team the obligation to fulfill the cartography

08:08.080 --> 08:09.080
in different teams.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.160
For example, you have the network team that will fulfill all the information that is related

08:13.160 --> 08:14.160
to the server.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.080
But you have the operating system team that will fulfill the virtual server.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.440
And the application manager that will explain the application and where they are installed.

08:22.440 --> 08:28.440
And so you can divide this different role within the applications.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.760
There is a history of change.

08:29.760 --> 08:34.040
Whenever something is changed, it's automatically traced in the applications.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.120
So this is a data model.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.920
So you have your entities and your relations.

08:38.920 --> 08:44.920
And entities support different processes that define business in macroprocessors and activities,

08:44.920 --> 08:50.840
operations, process use operations.

08:50.840 --> 08:54.240
You have at the middle here is the application that is divided in group, application and

08:54.240 --> 08:56.080
state on virtual servers.

08:56.080 --> 09:00.560
And these virtual servers are on physical servers.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.040
Mercator drives the dependencies between the object.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.400
It was object in a irrational view.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.480
You can view your macroprocess, your process, your activity, which also why your network

09:10.480 --> 09:16.400
and your server within this villain, but also view the physical infrastructure, the building,

09:16.400 --> 09:22.080
the rooms, the servers, the physical servers on the bay.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.040
Mercator draws also the physical network schema.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.320
You can define the physical link between the different elements.

09:28.320 --> 09:32.040
And you can view where they are installed.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.040
You can also explore the cartography.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
You select an object.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.880
You double click on the object and it pops all links between all these objects.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.720
And you can explore all your cartography and view what are the different links between

09:43.720 --> 09:47.680
all your assets.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.160
The main interest in the cartography is to generate reports.

09:51.160 --> 09:56.680
So the first major report that the cartography can do is the information system mapping report.

09:56.680 --> 10:03.400
It's a complete work document where you have all your assets of your information system.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.720
My hospital is 600 pages, imagine.

10:06.720 --> 10:11.800
And in this report, you can explore the cartography by clicking on the link.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.800
You have an application.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.200
You can view who uses this application or where the application is installed, on which

10:16.200 --> 10:20.000
virtual server it is installed, on the physical server, on which building, and you can follow

10:20.000 --> 10:22.960
the link within the word document.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.240
You can generate a list of supported entities and their application.

10:26.240 --> 10:33.640
You have all your entities and what applications they are using.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.640
Application by group.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.360
You have all your application by group.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.880
You can view is it a web application, is it a external application, who supports, where

10:39.880 --> 10:44.760
is it installed, on which physical server, and you have a list of all your applications.

10:44.760 --> 10:51.280
Your list of all your physical servers, what is the size of the server, where is it installed,

10:51.280 --> 10:56.840
how many disks, RAM is it using, and you can also make projections year by year and see

10:56.840 --> 10:59.240
how is it growing.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.760
You can analyze your security needs on different objects.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.600
It's a list.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.360
So this application denormalized the link between macro process, process application

11:08.360 --> 11:09.680
database, and information.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.200
You have this on the list.

11:11.200 --> 11:16.360
You can view here if you have correctly placed your security need in terms of confidentiality,

11:16.360 --> 11:21.880
integrity, traceability, and availability by denormalizing it.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.880
You can view your logical server configurations.

11:23.880 --> 11:28.680
List of logical server with a configuration, what operating system, what is installed on

11:28.680 --> 11:33.080
this logical server, who is responsible of it, and so on.

11:33.080 --> 11:38.320
And you finally have the inventory of all your physical infrastructure, a list of all

11:38.320 --> 11:39.840
your physical equipment.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.680
You can take this list, go in the IT room and check if it's correctly installed in the

11:44.680 --> 11:51.480
correct place and correctly labeled if you have information that are not in the list.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.080
So this is an example of information system mapping report.

11:55.080 --> 12:02.040
With a table of contents, you have your schema, and you can start browsing through the information

12:02.040 --> 12:04.600
system.

12:04.600 --> 12:09.040
This is an example of the physical inventory with your site, your room, your building,

12:09.040 --> 12:11.000
and your examples.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.240
This is an analysis of your security needs.

12:14.240 --> 12:19.000
So you denormalize, a link between macro process, process application database, and you can

12:19.000 --> 12:25.320
analyze difference in the requirement between each object.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.320
You can try to transmit to the characteristics of the last three months.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.920
You can track the update of the Mac.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.480
You can demonstrate to an auditor.com that your mapping is updated.

12:35.480 --> 12:41.000
For example, if you have in December some new application.com, you should have seen

12:41.000 --> 12:44.600
some change in the category by the different teams.

12:44.600 --> 12:53.040
May the category help you in the ISO 27001 certifications for the inventory of assets,

12:53.040 --> 12:57.960
for the ownership of assets, for the labeling of information, location protection of assets,

12:57.960 --> 13:05.920
management, you can see why a change impact other assets, which other assets does it impact.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.720
Capacity management, you have a view every year.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.080
You can take a view every year of what is your capacity.

13:11.080 --> 13:15.720
You can do vulnerability management because you know what type of operating system application

13:15.720 --> 13:20.920
you are using, and you can share from C-search and CVU what types of these vulnerabilities

13:20.920 --> 13:23.960
present in your inventory.

13:23.960 --> 13:29.120
You can do segregation of networks, security and supplier agreements, assessment of human

13:29.120 --> 13:30.840
security events.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.200
In case you have a security event, you can quickly search in your cartography.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.480
I heard about this, and you can directly search on journey cartography.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.480
You type a word.

13:39.480 --> 13:45.560
If this word appears in the name descriptions of type of equipment, automatically you get

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
the information.

13:46.560 --> 13:53.600
availability of information processing resource, you know how many servers are using what application

13:53.600 --> 13:57.120
so on, so you can do it really easily.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.160
The application is available on GitHub.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.560
It's under open source.

14:01.560 --> 14:06.680
It's used in three hospitals in Luxembourg and ten hospitals in France, three as myself

14:06.680 --> 14:08.400
and French municipalities.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.320
In fact, for the moment, ten contributors.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.120
We have a roadmap.

14:13.120 --> 14:21.680
We have tons of ID for the extension of Mercator, or main ID for the moment, treatment plan,

14:21.680 --> 14:26.120
treatment registry, it's an obligation by GDPR.

14:26.120 --> 14:30.240
You have all the treatment that must be in a registry.

14:30.240 --> 14:34.960
Crisis directory, whenever you have an incident, you would like if Mercator is not available

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
because there is an incident.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.280
Have it on a paper, have it on paper.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.280
What are the essential assets?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.440
What are the call phone number of your provider?

14:43.440 --> 14:47.640
What are their email address?

14:47.640 --> 14:54.440
We plan to make a link with Monark, Monark is Luxembourg-ish risk analysis methodology,

14:54.440 --> 14:59.880
so we can start by your asset and extract a model for risk analysis to analyze correctly

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
your risk.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.920
Okay, so thank you.

15:05.920 --> 15:30.280
Do we have some questions in the room?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.280
Thank you.

15:31.280 --> 15:36.480
I have a question related to application and operating specific assets and files.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.520
You've mentioned vulnerability management.

15:39.520 --> 15:45.960
I wanted to ask, are you consuming software materials in this specific tool?

15:45.960 --> 15:49.480
Second question, in addition to that, would be how do you consume that data?

15:49.480 --> 15:54.320
If so, thank you.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.560
For the moment, you have to enter all your assets by hand.

15:58.560 --> 16:04.200
There is no automatic tools that can explain who are your provider, what are your main

16:04.200 --> 16:10.000
business process, what are your inventory or physical inventory.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.880
There is no automatic tools or artificial intelligence that can do it for you.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.480
So for the moment, you have to enter it by hand.

16:17.480 --> 16:25.000
If you have already some Excel sheet with this document, there is an API, a REST API,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.160
which you can use to enter or extract the information.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.520
I don't remember the second question.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.200
Did I open it to both?

16:34.200 --> 16:38.240
Any other questions, Alvaro?

16:38.240 --> 16:44.280
I saw some question on metrics asking what was the URI for Mercator.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
It's there.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
UL?

16:47.280 --> 16:54.360
They were using for URI, so I'm a universal resource identificator.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.400
I don't know what context.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.360
So no other questions?

17:01.360 --> 17:03.360
Another one, okay.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.360
Hi.

17:04.360 --> 17:08.680
First of all, thank you for the talk.

17:08.680 --> 17:14.320
It's not much of a question, but more like a comment, following what the other guy asked

17:14.320 --> 17:20.960
or talked about, because basically the issue I see is how to populate the application.

17:20.960 --> 17:27.680
So basically you need to connect somehow Mercator with your CMDB or to explore your network.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.320
I don't know, for instance, if it could be with Blue Hunt or whatever.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.320
I don't know.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.720
OSCRE could help also.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.560
So how do you see that kind of connection?

17:38.560 --> 17:43.760
How could you bind Mercator with those tools that are already existing?

17:43.760 --> 17:50.600
Is there a way or are you already thinking to create some API or I don't know what could

17:50.600 --> 17:55.200
be like some magical way to interconnect those things?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
Yes.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.640
So for the moment we have a REST API.

17:58.640 --> 18:05.240
You can fulfill any table that are in the Mercator database with any inventory you already

18:05.240 --> 18:06.600
have in place.

18:06.600 --> 18:10.720
So we can make the link and update these tables automatically.

18:10.720 --> 18:16.160
For the moment we use it, for example, for the configures of our virtual machine.

18:16.160 --> 18:20.760
Every few months we update Mercator with the configuration of actual machines.

18:20.760 --> 18:29.600
So we don't have to do it manually because this is a boring task that has not a lot of

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
value.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.880
But most of the time you have to do it manually because this information exists nowhere.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.960
For example, how many users is it in this application?

18:37.960 --> 18:39.600
Is it a critical application?

18:39.600 --> 18:41.240
What kind of application is it?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.240
Who uses it?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.320
What is the FTO or FPO of these applications?

18:45.320 --> 18:49.240
All these questions have to be fulfilled manually and it's really important information you

18:49.240 --> 18:52.280
have to enter because you want to know them.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.440
What are my critical applications?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.440
What are my critical business processes?

18:56.440 --> 19:00.360
This is a critical process but you choose non-critical applications.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.360
Is it normal?

19:01.360 --> 19:09.120
You have to think about it to build this complete view of your information system using a cartography.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.160
Okay.

19:10.160 --> 19:23.480
So one more question.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.680
One question which is related to the other one.

19:25.680 --> 19:31.800
There are available open source inventory tools that you can use to automatically populate

19:31.800 --> 19:40.000
hardware and software inventory by just installing an agent on computers or just using a computer

19:40.000 --> 19:46.880
or using one agent which does remote inventory and use these agents and push the information

19:46.880 --> 19:49.280
into your tool.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.280
Are you considering using this kind of software?

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
Yes.

19:53.280 --> 20:01.920
There are so many tools that does network inventories and tools that we do not plan

20:01.920 --> 20:06.880
to for the moment to build our self-connectors with these tools.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.480
We try for the moment to improve the Mercator tools by itself.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.360
But as I say, there is an API.

20:13.360 --> 20:19.280
If you have an inventory and you want to populate this in Mercator, there is a REST API so only

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
push.

20:20.280 --> 20:26.640
We have in the documentation a few examples of usage of the API in C, in Python, in Bash

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
and so on.

20:27.640 --> 20:32.640
So it's really simple to build the scripts from your inventory you have to populate the

20:32.640 --> 20:33.640
Mercator database.

20:33.640 --> 20:39.200
But as I say, there are so many tools that you don't want to be linked with the tools,

20:39.200 --> 20:43.800
with specific automated tools to fulfill the Mercator.

20:43.800 --> 20:50.920
And also, these automatic tools fulfill less than 10% of the job you have to do to complete

20:50.920 --> 20:56.280
your cartography because most of the work you have to do is probably things you do not

20:56.280 --> 20:57.280
have already.

20:57.280 --> 21:04.640
And you cannot automate this process of completing the cartography.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.680
You cannot, there is no artificial intelligence that can explain to you what are your critical

21:08.680 --> 21:13.800
processes, what are your critical entities, what is the relation you have with them, what

21:13.800 --> 21:17.760
are your critical applications, what is the RTO and FPO of these applications.

21:17.760 --> 21:21.720
So something you have to do by hand.

21:21.720 --> 21:28.440
Okay, some more questions or we can enter earlier.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.000
So thank you for your talk.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Thank you.

21:31.000 --> 22:00.600
I don't know why it goes so fast.
