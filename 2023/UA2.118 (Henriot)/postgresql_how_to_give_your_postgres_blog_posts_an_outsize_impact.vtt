00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Hello.

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh, that works.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Cool.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
So, welcome to the PostgresQL dev room.

00:10.000 --> 00:23.440
If you just got here, you missed all the early morning excitement.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.000
These guys know.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.120
Can I please ask you, because this is a very loud room, take care with the seats, because

00:31.120 --> 00:35.040
they're very loud, and please silence your phones.

00:35.040 --> 00:43.280
Now, can we please welcome Claire Giordano, who's going to speak about Postgres blog posts

00:43.280 --> 00:47.120
and how to give them an outside impact.

00:47.120 --> 00:57.480
I have to get my phone so that I can take a selfie at some point in this talk.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
All right.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.480
So, how many of you, is it your first day of FOSDAM or your second?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.800
How many of you are here for your first day of FOSDAM?

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
Okay.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.560
Most of you were here yesterday.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
Yeah.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.120
And I love that it's not freezing cold this year.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.320
It's actually comfortable.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
All right.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.600
Well, I thank you for coming.

01:16.600 --> 01:23.160
This is my third FOSDAM, my second time giving a talk here in the Postgres dev room.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.680
Boris, I promise to stay in the proper range now.

01:26.680 --> 01:27.680
Okay.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
Am I good?

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
All right.

01:29.680 --> 01:38.920
So, I'm here to talk to you about how to give your Postgres blog posts an outside impact.

01:38.920 --> 01:45.560
And I'm really happy to talk about it, because sharing information about Postgres and our

01:45.560 --> 01:52.480
projects, new features, new capabilities is just super important to growing the community

01:52.480 --> 01:57.160
and having more people learn about it, use it, become developers on it.

01:57.160 --> 02:03.240
So, before I dive in a bit about my background, I started my career as an engineer in the

02:03.240 --> 02:05.920
developer tools group at Sun Microsystems.

02:05.920 --> 02:11.760
I worked on a predecessor to a predecessor to modern day GitHub and Git.

02:11.760 --> 02:16.720
And then I spent many years as an engineering manager in the kernel group at Sun.

02:16.720 --> 02:21.880
Before moving into product management, product marketing roles, I think of myself as a writer.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.600
That's why I care about blogging.

02:24.600 --> 02:29.200
And about six years ago, I joined a small startup in San Francisco.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.640
Well, not so small, but a startup nonetheless called Citus Data.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.760
Have any of you heard of Citus?

02:35.760 --> 02:36.760
Okay.

02:36.760 --> 02:41.140
So, some of you didn't raise your hands, but I know you've heard of Citus.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.400
And then after a couple of years, we were acquired by Microsoft.

02:44.400 --> 02:51.960
So I work at Microsoft, and this is a screenshot of the GitHub repo for the Citus database

02:51.960 --> 02:58.120
extension, which is an open source extension that I spend most of my days working on.

02:58.120 --> 03:03.040
And I put the screenshot there with the stars over on the right, because I'm on a mission

03:03.040 --> 03:09.640
to make sure people who know it, use it, like it, our supporters of it actually do go and

03:09.640 --> 03:15.120
give it a star so I can bump that number up and get some validation.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.280
So the reason I created this talk is I ran across this quote somewhere where somebody

03:20.280 --> 03:26.120
said about Postgres that it's not just open source, it's open engineering.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.480
And I'm looking at Joe Conway.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.840
Did that quote come from you?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.680
Or was it Peter Eisen trout?

03:30.680 --> 03:33.760
I'm not sure who it was, but it's a fabulous quote.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.120
And so I thought about, well, why not share the techniques and the best practices that

03:38.120 --> 03:45.680
we use, not just in engineering, but in engineering the blog posts and the content that we create.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.840
Now before I dive in, I have to give you a warning.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.600
There's a lot of dog illustrations in this talk.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.920
And that's because I'm here in Brussels and back home in California is my chocolate labrador

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
named Zuka.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.360
So I don't know, I had to inspire myself to think of her as I was working on it.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.840
Now the talk is going to have two parts.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.160
The first is what you write.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.400
The actual kind of drafting of the blog post.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.680
And the second is where you send it, who you send it to.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.480
And in marketing speak, that means we're going to talk about content and then we're going

04:16.480 --> 04:19.480
to talk about distribution.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.040
Now let's dive into content first.

04:22.040 --> 04:26.880
And in this area, I want to start with you in your frame of mind when you're creating

04:26.880 --> 04:28.440
these blog posts.

04:28.440 --> 04:34.360
And then we'll talk a bit about the edit cycle after that, which is also super important.

04:34.360 --> 04:40.320
And I think my first tip for you when you're creating a blog is to write with a specific

04:40.320 --> 04:41.960
reader in mind.

04:41.960 --> 04:46.280
Now, and think of who's this person that you want to read it?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.080
What kind of skills do they have?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.360
What kind of problems?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.880
See those are those, sorry.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.760
The seats are really loud in here, aren't they?

04:53.760 --> 04:54.760
Yeah, welcome.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.760
I'm glad you're here.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.280
Who do you want to read it?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
What are their skills?

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
What are their interests?

05:00.280 --> 05:02.520
And write to that individual.

05:02.520 --> 05:09.440
This may seem obvious, but for a lot of us, when we try to write to this vague, big, amorphous

05:09.440 --> 05:15.040
world out there, the blog post kind of ends up like hotel food.

05:15.040 --> 05:20.240
And I mean bad, boring hotel food where it's trying to appeal to everybody and doesn't

05:20.240 --> 05:25.480
dare have any strong flavors or strong spices and ends up being very bland.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.840
So write to that specific person as you're creating it.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.240
And then the second tip is also obvious.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.040
Make good topics.

05:34.040 --> 05:38.240
But I put it up there because in many, well there have been many conversations I've had

05:38.240 --> 05:41.720
with people where they've said, you know, I want to start blogging, I want to start

05:41.720 --> 05:45.680
sharing my expertise, but I don't know what to write about.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.880
And so I just want to tell you that the world, the internet is full of inspiration of what

05:51.880 --> 05:52.880
to write about.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.080
And every time you send an internal email answering a question or somebody comes, if

05:58.080 --> 06:03.160
you're working in an office or with a team of people in person, someone comes in and

06:03.160 --> 06:05.000
asks you a question.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.760
Maybe your answer is good fodder for a post.

06:08.760 --> 06:14.120
Maybe more than that person has that question and it should be shared more broadly.

06:14.120 --> 06:21.760
So whether it's Stack Overflow as well or the Postgres Slack, the IRC channel, Reddit,

06:21.760 --> 06:25.200
there's a lot of, there's different subreddits.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.760
There's one for Postgres, but there's other ones that deal with databases and distributed

06:28.760 --> 06:30.160
systems as well.

06:30.160 --> 06:35.400
There's questions that come up there that might make a good blog topic too.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.640
And then just make sure those blogs are interesting.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.880
Like, again, not bland, not boring.

06:40.880 --> 06:46.240
Okay, and the third tip when you think about your frame of mind is to have empathy for

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
your reader.

06:47.240 --> 06:53.000
That's probably the most important takeaway from this talk is to have empathy.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.920
And so what does empathy mean?

06:54.920 --> 06:56.560
It does not mean sympathy.

06:56.560 --> 07:04.160
I love this cartoon from Human Cloud of Gaping Void and on the left he describes empathy

07:04.160 --> 07:06.840
as I feel your pain.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.640
I physically feel how you feel.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.600
I really understand and have empathy for your situation.

07:13.600 --> 07:20.080
Whereas sympathy is just, oh, I'm sorry that you're in pain, which is kind of just words.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.320
It doesn't have the same impact.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.880
So the goal is to have empathy be your true north.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.120
And that means you're going to care about the reader more than you care about yourself.

07:31.120 --> 07:36.840
That means you're going to put in some extra effort in creating the blog post and recognize

07:36.840 --> 07:41.600
that they're busy, they're in a hurry, so you should write and create this post so that

07:41.600 --> 07:45.440
it's easy for them to quickly get answers to their questions.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.260
And just remember that they don't know what you know.

07:48.260 --> 07:52.920
So when you work with a team of people who have similar knowledge, expertise, and skills,

07:52.920 --> 07:54.640
we use a lot of shortcuts.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.680
Like we use acronyms and we don't have to define or explain concepts.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.000
We all understand.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.640
Anybody who works with Citus understands what sharding is, for example.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.560
But the reader doesn't necessarily know what you know, so taking a few moments to define

08:09.560 --> 08:15.360
a term or explain a concept or link to a background blog is super helpful to them.

08:15.360 --> 08:22.840
All right, so let's dive into specific tactics that you can use to apply empathy and really

08:22.840 --> 08:24.360
care about your readers.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.440
And the first is to make your blog posts scannable.

08:27.440 --> 08:33.700
I grabbed these two big, chunky, dense paragraphs from the internet as an example of what you

08:33.700 --> 08:35.400
should not do.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.440
I can't even bring myself to read them.

08:37.440 --> 08:43.220
They're in my talk and I've not read those paragraphs because it's just blah, blah, blah.

08:43.220 --> 08:48.080
My brain cannot embrace whatever they're trying to tell me.

08:48.080 --> 08:53.280
So because people are in a hurry, you've got to make it easy for them to find the part

08:53.280 --> 08:56.120
of the post that will help them.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.080
And one mistake a lot of people make is they...

09:00.080 --> 09:01.080
It's okay.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.160
It's totally okay.

09:03.160 --> 09:08.200
They assume someone's going to read the whole post from the beginning to the end, but they're

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
not.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
They're going to jump around.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.800
Maybe they'll start in the middle.

09:11.800 --> 09:17.080
And so when I think about how to make things scannable, there's a bunch of techniques that

09:17.080 --> 09:20.440
I just wanted to point out that are super useful.

09:20.440 --> 09:26.760
The first is to have section headlines that break up the post, H2s, if you will.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.600
But they should not be subject titles, and we'll talk about that in a moment.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.640
They should actually be headlines, like headlines you'd see in a newspaper.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.640
Use bullets.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.680
Bullets are fabulous for scanning.

09:36.680 --> 09:41.600
If the bullets are multi-line bullets, put a bold font prefix at the beginning of each

09:41.600 --> 09:45.600
one, just like two, three words, that tells them what that bullet is about.

09:45.600 --> 09:50.080
And then most people will just read those bold font prefixes, and they may not read

09:50.080 --> 09:53.360
the rest of it if it's not what they're looking for.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.840
Short sentences and short paragraphs are your friend.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.640
White space is also a big friend.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.360
And then tables are super helpful, too.

10:02.360 --> 10:06.600
I was reviewing a blog post with someone once, and they were sharing just three or four pieces

10:06.600 --> 10:12.000
of performance benchmark data, but they were doing it in sentences, like in the copy.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.960
And when we took those numbers out and we put them in a super small, like, two-by-three

10:15.960 --> 10:21.160
table, all of a sudden the conclusion just popped, whereas before it was hidden in the

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
paragraphs.

10:22.160 --> 10:29.320
So I just said we'd talk about the section headlines, the H2s, a few seconds ago.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.240
So here's a couple examples.

10:31.240 --> 10:35.520
And these are actual examples from actual blogs that I worked on with people.

10:35.520 --> 10:41.800
And in this first example, literally the H2 said example, which is nice.

10:41.800 --> 10:47.120
It tells you, okay, we're going to look at something that will help show me what we're

10:47.120 --> 10:48.320
talking about.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.960
But in fact, it's much better if it were to say a real-world example, a multi-tenant to-do

10:52.960 --> 10:54.520
application.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.880
It gives more specifics about what's going to be in that section.

10:57.880 --> 11:04.000
Similarly, I was working on a blog post with, I don't even remember who it was with, and

11:04.000 --> 11:06.360
the H2 just said PG Bouncer, which is great.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.880
It tells you that section is about PG Bouncer.

11:08.880 --> 11:09.960
That's useful.

11:09.960 --> 11:14.920
But it's even more useful if we tell you in the H2 that this is about how to set up PG

11:14.920 --> 11:15.920
Bouncer.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.640
And oh, by the way, it's our preferred connection puller.

11:18.640 --> 11:25.440
So just being more specific can help the reader, and it primes their brain as to what they're

11:25.440 --> 11:30.000
going to get or tells them whether to even read that section.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.280
Okay.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.200
Now not everybody is a reader.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.440
So I already said people aren't going to read the whole thing.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.760
They're going to bounce around.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.520
But people's brains process information differently.

11:41.520 --> 11:47.000
So how many of you think of yourselves as being visual in how you process information?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.280
Okay.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.360
And how many of you, when you're explaining something to a colleague, the first thing you

11:51.360 --> 11:54.840
do is jump up to a whiteboard and start sketching diagrams?

11:54.840 --> 11:55.840
Yeah.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.400
Okay.

11:57.400 --> 12:03.120
So to make your blog post more accessible to more people, it shouldn't just be paragraphs

12:03.120 --> 12:04.720
and words and sentences.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.160
But obviously a picture speaks a thousand words, so including a diagram in there and

12:09.160 --> 12:15.560
taking the time to figure out what should that diagram be can make a world of difference.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.640
I gave you the example of tables before.

12:17.640 --> 12:22.560
Those are super helpful when you're sharing numeric information.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.020
For those of us who work on cloud services, sometimes having that screenshot of whatever

12:27.020 --> 12:30.520
is going on in the UI can be really helpful.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.660
And then code blocks as well.

12:32.660 --> 12:35.900
Particularly when you're talking about some new capability or trying to show someone how

12:35.900 --> 12:39.180
to use something, that code block is huge.

12:39.180 --> 12:42.040
So the variety of formats can help.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.440
I took this screenshot, don't worry about it, from a blog post that David Rowley wrote

12:47.440 --> 12:52.680
last year about speeding up sort performance in Postgres 15.

12:52.680 --> 12:58.040
He's one of the Postgres contributors that works on my team at Microsoft.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.840
And without this chart, the blog post would have been nice.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.920
It would have been good.

13:02.920 --> 13:09.040
But it was so much more powerful when you show visually what the results were and how

13:09.040 --> 13:13.000
sort performance was sped up.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.600
And when you do include diagrams or charts, it's important to remember to put alt text

13:19.600 --> 13:25.800
in there, not just because we care about people who are visually impaired and are using screen

13:25.800 --> 13:32.680
readers, but also it influences how your blog post will get ranked on search engines.

13:32.680 --> 13:37.680
Because alt text is one of the factors and things that the search engines look for.

13:37.680 --> 13:41.020
Using H2s as well can also help screen readers.

13:41.020 --> 13:45.040
So don't just, when you have those section headlines we talked about earlier, don't just

13:45.040 --> 13:49.960
put a bold font in and make it a bigger font size, actually change the paragraph format

13:49.960 --> 13:55.680
to H2 or section header or whatever it's called in your platform.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.680
And that will help those screen readers too.

13:58.680 --> 14:03.040
The other thing I'll say about this chart is it looked totally different at first.

14:03.040 --> 14:08.400
We iterated on it to try to figure out how do we make the story pop.

14:08.400 --> 14:13.760
We ended up pivoting it by 90 degrees, changing the title, changing how we labeled things

14:13.760 --> 14:17.520
and doing our best to make it drop dead easy to understand.

14:17.520 --> 14:27.040
All right, the third technique in the empathy area that I want to point out is readability.

14:27.040 --> 14:32.560
And I always recommend to people that you write at the third or fifth grade level, maybe

14:32.560 --> 14:34.480
sixth grade is okay.

14:34.480 --> 14:44.760
But a lot of us in engineering were trained to write in very formal, academic, dry tones

14:44.760 --> 14:50.480
of voice and even at the 16th grade level, at the 14th grade level.

14:50.480 --> 14:53.880
And that's hard for people to read, especially when they're in a hurry and trying to get

14:53.880 --> 14:54.960
something done.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.840
So if you simplify your writing that can make a big difference.

14:58.840 --> 15:05.080
This is a screenshot of a tool that I use called the Hemingway app and if you go and

15:05.080 --> 15:09.520
you put copy from your blog post in there, it'll tell you what grade level.

15:09.520 --> 15:14.200
It's written that and will give you some specific suggestions about how you can simplify your

15:14.200 --> 15:15.840
writing.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.520
And that assumes you're writing in English.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.000
I don't know if it has support for other languages.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.680
Other people are big fans of Grammarly and I'm glad you're here.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.280
And so absolutely recommend this.

15:30.280 --> 15:34.280
The other aspect of readability that I want to point out is I always recommend people

15:34.280 --> 15:37.760
write in a conversational tone of voice.

15:37.760 --> 15:46.320
Again, going back to how we were taught to write, it was very formal, pedantic even,

15:46.320 --> 15:48.760
official, academic.

15:48.760 --> 15:53.720
But actually when people are in a hurry, their brains are wired for conversation.

15:53.720 --> 15:59.160
So if you write in that easy, accessible conversational tone of voice, you're going to have more people

15:59.160 --> 16:00.800
recommending your blog post.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.600
You're going to have more people actually reading it versus just bouncing and leaving

16:04.600 --> 16:10.560
deciding oh this is too much work or the worst is I'll read this later, which of course most

16:10.560 --> 16:13.480
people don't ever do.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.040
So part of writing in a conversational tone of voice, like how do you do it?

16:18.040 --> 16:23.520
I always tell people to imagine that they're sitting over coffee and trying to explain

16:23.520 --> 16:28.880
to another engineer or developer how this thing works or whatever the topic is.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.080
And maybe that person is their best friend and they're going for a job interview and

16:32.080 --> 16:34.440
they really need to understand.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.600
How are you going to explain it to them so that it makes sense, so that they get it?

16:38.600 --> 16:43.600
That's the kind of conversational tone of voice that you want to employ.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.080
And then I also recommend people write in the second person you.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.280
And that's because your reader doesn't care about yourself.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.720
They don't care about the author.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.920
They care about themselves.

16:55.920 --> 17:01.520
So when you speak to you, when you write about you, and in the screenshot here I put like

17:01.520 --> 17:06.640
little I don't know if you can see them, oh yes you can, the yellow boxes around all the

17:06.640 --> 17:08.440
instances of the word you.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.500
And a lot of times in the first draft, the word you won't even show up.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.760
People will just say I, I, we, we, I'm doing this, this is all about me.

17:16.760 --> 17:20.440
Kind of like in the beginning of this talk when I introduced myself.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.440
Probably a lot of you didn't care.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.360
You just wanted to get to the meat of the topic.

17:24.360 --> 17:29.440
So speak to you and write in that conversational tone of voice.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.880
So I'm a big fan of Checklist.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.380
I don't know how many of you have read this wonderful book by Atul Gawande called The

17:36.380 --> 17:38.840
Checklist Manifesto.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
Anybody?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.040
Oh cool.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
I recommend it.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.000
It's a really wonderful book and it talks about using Checklist not just in his field

17:48.000 --> 17:54.600
which is medicine and surgery but also in other fields like airline pilots and people

17:54.600 --> 17:58.600
in charge of big masses like skyscraper construction projects.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.720
Anyway, so a big fan of Checklist.

18:00.720 --> 18:04.960
So here's a Checklist that summarizes the three things we just talked about regarding

18:04.960 --> 18:08.720
scanability, variety of formats, and readability.

18:08.720 --> 18:15.480
All right, and now we're going to pivot away from you and your frame of mind and empathy

18:15.480 --> 18:19.520
and talk about the edit cycle.

18:19.520 --> 18:24.680
So I think the first thing I tell people who are starting off blogging or even experts

18:24.680 --> 18:31.920
who are looking to get better is to just embrace the edit cycle and the iteration.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.920
You have to do the work.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.280
Now I suppose that's not true for everybody.

18:36.280 --> 18:42.560
I do know some people who are kind of famous and they can write really crappy blog posts

18:42.560 --> 18:49.760
and people are going to give it a plus one and promote it and they'll get a lot of traffic

18:49.760 --> 18:52.440
even though it's not actually very helpful, it's not actually very good, but they're

18:52.440 --> 18:55.360
famous and so they get that kind of benefit.

18:55.360 --> 19:01.120
But for most of us mere humans, we've got to do the work to make something usable by

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
people.

19:02.120 --> 19:07.960
I'm a fan of this writer named David Perrell and I grabbed this screenshot of a tweet that

19:07.960 --> 19:12.960
he did and you don't really need to read the words, but the visual kind of tells the story

19:12.960 --> 19:18.680
that when you are creating a blog and probably the same is true for coding, you end up going

19:18.680 --> 19:22.840
down a lot of dead ends and that's what all those gray lines are meant to represent.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.360
They're things that you thought were going to be part of the blog, ways of explaining

19:26.360 --> 19:29.360
that you thought were going to be useful, but they weren't and you had to throw them

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
away.

19:30.360 --> 19:36.920
And it's only in, and these are his words, good writing is only obvious in retrospect

19:36.920 --> 19:43.200
and so that purple line could not have been found without all those gray dead ends.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.080
And yeah, so you've got to edit.

19:47.080 --> 19:52.680
The other thing that is important is that it's okay for your first draft to suck.

19:52.680 --> 19:58.280
So especially with people who are creating blogs for the first time, they'll get a little

19:58.280 --> 20:03.320
bit stuck because they're not sure how to say it and they literally, their hands are

20:03.320 --> 20:09.820
frozen over the keyboard and you just have to recognize that dirty little secret that

20:09.820 --> 20:14.440
everybody's first drafts suck and that's okay.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.300
So if you get, once you give yourself permission to write something bad, then you're well on

20:18.300 --> 20:22.440
your way to having a good end result.

20:22.440 --> 20:28.240
So the other quote people often use is perfect is the enemy of the good.

20:28.240 --> 20:32.320
These images of these artists though are kind of interesting because when you think about

20:32.320 --> 20:39.320
artists, because their initial sketches are typically not shared with a team, they feel

20:39.320 --> 20:40.320
free.

20:40.320 --> 20:47.040
They don't have anybody judging them and they can go scribble and draw and experiment and

20:47.040 --> 20:53.600
create some really amazing things by exploring in ways that they wouldn't be able to do if

20:53.600 --> 20:56.860
they felt like they had an audience right there.

20:56.860 --> 21:01.200
So the technique that some people do is they just go, okay, I'm not going to share my first

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
draft with anybody.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.320
I'm going to wait until it's a second draft and it's a little more refined and maybe that's

21:06.320 --> 21:07.760
what you have to tell yourself.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.400
I just write crappy first drafts and I'm not embarrassed by it because I know the end result

21:12.400 --> 21:15.240
is going to be really freaking good.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.960
All right, feedback is a gift.

21:17.960 --> 21:24.680
So if you find good reviewers, they're gold and say thank you and like have gratitude

21:24.680 --> 21:25.680
for it.

21:25.680 --> 21:31.280
I've worked with some brilliant bloggers in my career who if you ask them to review your

21:31.280 --> 21:33.920
post you'll get, oh yeah, it looks fine, looks pretty good.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.920
You got some typo in the fourth paragraph but other than that it looks good.

21:38.920 --> 21:44.840
That's generally not complete feedback and maybe they didn't even read the thing.

21:44.840 --> 21:50.800
So hopefully you can find people who will look at what's missing or who will give you

21:50.800 --> 21:57.840
specific actionable ideas for how you can improve it or flag the things that are confusing.

21:57.840 --> 22:02.520
Now one of the things I do, particularly when I'm working with folks who are super crazy

22:02.520 --> 22:08.240
busy and who I know are really carving out part of their weekend time or their evening

22:08.240 --> 22:13.460
time to give me feedback is I will ask them to focus on something specific.

22:13.460 --> 22:18.560
So like if you're giving some important post out to three engineers, give them each a different

22:18.560 --> 22:20.360
part, a different assignment.

22:20.360 --> 22:25.520
Hey Joe, I want you to look at the conclusion and make sure I didn't miss anything.

22:25.520 --> 22:30.000
Bertrand, can you look at the diagrams in the middle and make sure that they're clear?

22:30.000 --> 22:34.920
I'm just calling you guys out because you're on the back row so hello.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.140
So giving people those areas of focus can help.

22:38.140 --> 22:43.080
I don't know who to attribute this screenshot here but I have used it with people and it's

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
super effective.

22:44.080 --> 22:52.800
I'll tell them to flag anything that's confusing, flag anything where their mind starts to wander

22:52.800 --> 22:57.800
because when their mind wanders then that means they're probably bored and I need to

22:57.800 --> 23:01.400
go cut or fix it or do something.

23:01.400 --> 23:07.440
To flag maybe the 10% that they love that I better not throw away in my next edit cycle

23:07.440 --> 23:10.160
and then scribble any ideas for what might be missing.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.340
And people have loved that technique and have said thank you to me for making it easy for

23:15.340 --> 23:17.120
them to help me.

23:17.120 --> 23:24.160
Okay, fifth tip in the edit cycle is just be willing to get your scissors out and to

23:24.160 --> 23:26.160
cut and to cut.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.680
Have any of you ever, are any of you Stephen King fans?

23:30.680 --> 23:36.600
One, two, three, four, half, four and a half.

23:36.600 --> 23:43.740
So Stephen King wrote, I'm actually not a big fan of his horror books but over the years

23:43.740 --> 23:47.760
I've found some of his books that I absolutely love and the one I love the most is called

23:47.760 --> 23:49.760
On Writing.

23:49.760 --> 23:54.320
And we all know if you work in engineering and you work with software that a big part

23:54.320 --> 23:56.160
of your job is communicating, right?

23:56.160 --> 23:58.680
It is explaining things to other people.

23:58.680 --> 24:02.480
So if you've ever wanted to get better at writing that is the book to read and it's

24:02.480 --> 24:08.480
part autobiographical and was written by, well he wrote it as he was recovering from

24:08.480 --> 24:14.280
an accident where he'd been hit by a car but it's part about the craft of writing.

24:14.280 --> 24:19.840
And in it he has a quote that says, kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it

24:19.840 --> 24:25.520
breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.720
And I just love that quote.

24:26.720 --> 24:31.880
A lot of people misquoted as kill your babies which I think is rather grotesque but the

24:31.880 --> 24:35.000
idea is you've got to be willing to throw stuff away.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.440
And if you can't bring yourself to throw stuff away and delete it, one of the things I do

24:39.440 --> 24:43.360
is I just put a section at the bottom of the document called the cutting room floor and

24:43.360 --> 24:45.200
I just move stuff down there.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.280
And then I somehow feel better about it.

24:47.280 --> 24:52.660
Like well I'll be able to go back and get it if I decide it really should be reinstated.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.660
That never happens.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.200
It never gets reinstated.

24:55.200 --> 25:01.480
But psychologically putting it in the cutting room floor for me is better than killing it.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.440
But you just got to be willing to cut.

25:03.440 --> 25:07.080
Otherwise people will get bored and they will leave your blog because it will be full of

25:07.080 --> 25:11.560
noise and you won't have enough signal to noise in that ratio.

25:11.560 --> 25:17.480
All right, number six, forking your blog post into several shorter blogs.

25:17.480 --> 25:24.160
So Andres Freund who some of you probably saw, he was here at Fosdom PG Day on Friday

25:24.160 --> 25:26.000
and he's probably around right now.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.120
No, he's probably on his way to the airport.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.440
I worked with him on some blog posts that he wrote over a year ago about connection

25:33.440 --> 25:35.480
scalability and post graphs.

25:35.480 --> 25:40.240
And when he shared the first draft with me, it was really freaking long.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.840
And I didn't even have to tell him that it was long.

25:42.840 --> 25:46.520
He started off with, yeah, maybe I should split this into two different posts.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.840
Well he ended up splitting it into three different posts.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.560
And I think all three of them hit front page hacker news and they all got a ton of traffic

25:54.560 --> 25:56.460
and they were all useful.

25:56.460 --> 26:02.440
And I would argue that having three shorter posts made the information more accessible

26:02.440 --> 26:03.940
to people.

26:03.940 --> 26:08.240
People tend to have shorter amounts of time available to read or to learn.

26:08.240 --> 26:14.320
So this is a technique that can work wonders for you in the edit cycle is to cut things

26:14.320 --> 26:15.360
apart.

26:15.360 --> 26:19.060
And then just keeping it simple, which is really hard to do, especially when you're

26:19.060 --> 26:23.920
trying to explain a concept that's complicated.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.120
But you can keep it simple in a lot of different ways.

26:27.120 --> 26:30.920
Like one of the things you can do is just move certain details into footnotes.

26:30.920 --> 26:35.200
So they're not cluttering your main points, but they're still there.

26:35.200 --> 26:40.340
You can also use analogies to help people understand a difficult concept to make it

26:40.340 --> 26:46.480
easier for them to put that concept that's new to them in a mental model that they already

26:46.480 --> 26:47.480
have.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.120
And then of course writing at that third or fifth grade level will help keep things simple

26:51.120 --> 26:53.200
as well.

26:53.200 --> 26:56.040
And then number eight, reading it out loud.

26:56.040 --> 27:02.440
So it's interesting when I read, and this is true for many people, when I read something

27:02.440 --> 27:08.480
silently in my head, if there's a mistake in it, my brain will self correct it.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.120
And I won't even notice the mistake.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.960
Like it's just, I'll be oblivious to it.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.800
But if I read it out loud, I hear it immediately.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.720
It's like nails on a chalkboard.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.940
I hear it.

27:19.940 --> 27:26.240
So reading out loud is a great way to find errors in what you've written or to find that

27:26.240 --> 27:28.640
it's confusing or long winded.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.680
You've almost run out of breath when you're reading it and you're like, oh, maybe I should

27:32.680 --> 27:35.600
simplify that or shorten it.

27:35.600 --> 27:41.440
It's also a good way to assess if you've written in that conversational tone of voice.

27:41.440 --> 27:46.160
If when you're reading it out loud, you're like, oh, I would never say that.

27:46.160 --> 27:51.480
Well then it's time to get your red pen out and go fix it to make it more conversational.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.200
All right.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.220
So then the nice tip is to optimize for SEO.

27:56.220 --> 28:00.280
So most of you know SEO stands for search engine optimization.

28:00.280 --> 28:06.600
And improving some basic SEO attributes of your post will make it more likely that your

28:06.600 --> 28:10.920
post will show up on that first page of search results.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.400
And you do not need to be an SEO expert at all.

28:13.400 --> 28:18.560
You just need a few very, very basic skills that you can learn today.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.680
And as long as you retain them, you're good to go.

28:21.680 --> 28:27.960
But I have to tell you first that all these few basic SEO tips are not worth your time

28:27.960 --> 28:30.040
if you don't have good content, right?

28:30.040 --> 28:36.360
If it's not scannable, if it's not readable, if you haven't written in a conversational

28:36.360 --> 28:40.240
tone of voice, then the SEO stuff's not going to help you at all.

28:40.240 --> 28:44.240
So starting with good content, there are a few things you can do.

28:44.240 --> 28:50.400
And the first is just to spend a few extra minutes, maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes on the

28:50.400 --> 28:52.600
title.

28:52.600 --> 28:58.760
The title is what's going to cause people to click or not click if they discover or

28:58.760 --> 29:03.720
see your blog post somewhere in search results.

29:03.720 --> 29:10.920
And also the keywords in the title are going to affect on what search results your blog

29:10.920 --> 29:13.040
is going to show up.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
Not just the keywords in the title.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.120
Obviously the search engines use a lot of factors.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.180
But it's very, very important.

29:20.180 --> 29:27.480
So what I've found is I have to create at least 15 bad titles to come up with one good

29:27.480 --> 29:28.480
title.

29:28.480 --> 29:33.280
So, and it's interesting because a lot of times when people on my team will create blogs,

29:33.280 --> 29:36.200
they'll literally just create one title.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.760
And that's just the starting point.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.440
They think they're at the finish point, but it's just the starting point.

29:40.440 --> 29:44.420
And then we riff from there to come up with other alternatives.

29:44.420 --> 29:50.520
So this is an example of a screenshot of 15 different titles that Mark Oslott and I were

29:50.520 --> 29:58.240
experimenting with and fiddling with for some blog last October about the Citus 11.1 open

29:58.240 --> 30:00.240
source release.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.840
And it looks like noise.

30:01.840 --> 30:06.160
I probably should have displayed these in categories, but there really is a method to

30:06.160 --> 30:07.480
the madness here.

30:07.480 --> 30:12.720
Like some of these titles use Postgres as well as Citus in the title.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.640
For people who don't know the connection.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.040
It's an important connection.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.720
So maybe the title had to include both.

30:19.720 --> 30:25.120
We were fiddling with different ways to talk about like without blocking rights or without

30:25.120 --> 30:31.420
interruption or how are the other ways, using create distributed table concurrently.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.680
So using different terms to express the same concept.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.800
15 minutes.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.720
I better talk faster, huh?

30:38.720 --> 30:39.720
Okay.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.760
I'll get going.

30:40.760 --> 30:45.760
So the bottom line is don't be afraid to generate a whole bunch of titles and fiddle and experiment

30:45.760 --> 30:49.000
to try to come up with what the right answer is.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.600
Now there's three techniques for assessing once you have a list.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.240
The first is are the most important terms in the first 60 characters.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.920
So on a Google search results page, they will truncate the title after 60 characters.

31:00.920 --> 31:05.040
So don't take the most important word and put it later in the title because then people

31:05.040 --> 31:09.240
are never going to see it and it's not going to cause them to click.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.480
Also just is it boring versus is it interesting?

31:12.480 --> 31:19.720
And I'll often use incognito browser searches to figure out, you know, what other things

31:19.720 --> 31:26.140
are popping up already for those particular search keywords and terms.

31:26.140 --> 31:29.840
And I definitely don't want to use a title that somebody else has already used.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.280
Like that would be a bad thing.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.720
So that's one reason to kind of compare to what's out there in the world.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.000
All right.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.880
And then a few more bullets here on the right-hand side of things to pay attention to.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.880
I will often advise people to avoid general terms like solution.

31:46.880 --> 31:47.960
I can't stand that one.

31:47.960 --> 31:54.480
Like why say solution when you could just say database or Postgres or Citus?

31:54.480 --> 31:58.640
I really pay attention to pronouns like it and this.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.920
A lot of us like to be efficient in our writing.

32:00.920 --> 32:06.440
And so using it makes things sound a little bit less repetitive and I get it.

32:06.440 --> 32:11.880
But almost always that pronoun introduces an ambiguity because it could be referring

32:11.880 --> 32:14.840
to this noun or maybe to that noun.

32:14.840 --> 32:18.640
And for somebody who's in a hurry, it stops them dead in their tracks to try to figure

32:18.640 --> 32:22.120
out what you're referring to and they're not quite sure what you meant.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.020
So that's another tip.

32:24.020 --> 32:31.920
And then I try to when you create hyperlinks, like it's a really bad idea to ever use like

32:31.920 --> 32:37.080
the word here as the anchor text for a hyperlink or anything generic.

32:37.080 --> 32:42.960
You want the anchor text that has the underline under it that links to wherever you're taking

32:42.960 --> 32:48.240
them off site to have very specific and relevant keywords to wherever you're taking them, not

32:48.240 --> 32:50.000
vague and general ones.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.120
And it's actually something that matters to the search engines.

32:54.120 --> 32:59.440
So those are some SEO tips, but I'm going to move on as quickly as I can because there's

32:59.440 --> 33:01.680
more to talk about.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.120
Alt text for graphics, I mentioned that earlier.

33:04.120 --> 33:09.280
And then Google actually also cares about this thing called EAT for author bios.

33:09.280 --> 33:15.460
And that stands for expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness.

33:15.460 --> 33:21.280
And so on your blog platform, wherever you publish, make sure that there's a bio description

33:21.280 --> 33:22.520
for you.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.000
And it's always it's nice to make it fun.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.320
In my case, I would say that I love chocolate Labradors or I love sailing in Greece, but

33:29.320 --> 33:33.960
it's even more important to show your expertise and your trustworthiness.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.560
You know, the examples, let's see, do I have two examples here?

33:37.560 --> 33:38.560
Yeah.

33:38.560 --> 33:43.080
So in Marco's case, the second one down, you know, I showed that he has a PhD in distributed

33:43.080 --> 33:46.860
systems and that he's the lead engineer on the site of his database team.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.480
And also like what conferences he's spoken at.

33:49.480 --> 33:54.640
Apparently the EAT team of reviewers care a lot about conference talks.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.140
That's one of the ways they decide somebody is credible in a field.

33:58.140 --> 34:04.400
For Thomas Monroe, who's another Postgres engineer on our team, again, list what conferences

34:04.400 --> 34:09.920
that he spoke at and the fact that, you know, he's a core developer, et cetera, et cetera.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.320
OK, so again, another checklist.

34:12.320 --> 34:17.760
I will be publishing my slides afterwards, so you'll be able to grab these if you find

34:17.760 --> 34:20.040
them useful.

34:20.040 --> 34:26.400
And I think I've got all of the editing tips here as well as the SEO tips.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.480
Cool?

34:27.480 --> 34:32.480
So now we're done with content, both you as well as the edit cycle.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.920
And I want to talk for just a few minutes on distribution, which is kind of how do you

34:36.920 --> 34:37.920
publish?

34:37.920 --> 34:41.440
So first I want to ask a question, which is somebody said this to me once.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.680
We're going to know which blog posts are good by how much traffic they get.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
True?

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
Show of hands?

34:47.680 --> 34:48.680
False.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.680
Show of hands.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.200
OK, so it's false.

34:53.200 --> 35:00.880
Like, typically how much traffic something gets is more a factor of how much was it shared?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.560
How much was it promoted?

35:02.560 --> 35:07.200
Did you actually distribute it and get it out into the world?

35:07.200 --> 35:11.160
Distribution trumps content almost all of the time.

35:11.160 --> 35:17.480
So there's two aspects of distribution, the publishing platform itself, which you need

35:17.480 --> 35:20.720
to be smart about that, but we're not going to talk about that today.

35:20.720 --> 35:25.080
We'll focus instead on how to promote your blog posts.

35:25.080 --> 35:30.520
So one pro tip I always share with people is as soon as you publish, but before you

35:30.520 --> 35:35.840
start sharing it, before anybody starts sharing it, double check what I call the unfurl of

35:35.840 --> 35:38.480
that URL.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.760
That might be a slack term.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.800
So I'm sure there's another term for it.

35:41.800 --> 35:47.400
But basically, when you share your URL on different platforms, the HTML metadata will

35:47.400 --> 35:48.400
get displayed, right?

35:48.400 --> 35:53.800
The HTML title, the HTML description, as is here, title, description, as well as the OG

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
image, right?

35:54.800 --> 35:57.240
Or the social graphic, or the teaser graphic.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.480
Different blog platforms call it different things.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.960
And sometimes people have screwed up and they have the wrong graphic or they didn't fix

36:03.960 --> 36:05.200
their description.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.480
And then some of these social platforms cache the graphic in particular.

36:09.480 --> 36:14.960
So if you notice the mistake seconds after you tweet it out the first time, Twitter is

36:14.960 --> 36:20.040
going to cache that graphic for 24 to 48 hours and you can fix it, but people are still going

36:20.040 --> 36:21.920
to see the wrong one.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.760
So it's just worth double checking that before you start sharing.

36:25.760 --> 36:31.080
And then I always put a plug in for Planet Postgrass if your blog is about Postgrass

36:31.080 --> 36:37.700
and it complies with all of the Planet Postgrass policies, syndicating it there is a great

36:37.700 --> 36:43.480
way to get it into people's RSS feeds and also you'll see on the right here that there's

36:43.480 --> 36:48.600
a Planet Postgrass Twitter account and on Mastodon there's a Planet Postgrass unofficial

36:48.600 --> 36:50.200
bot account too.

36:50.200 --> 36:56.000
And so then you can, people follow that account on Mastodon or on Twitter and it's another

36:56.000 --> 36:57.400
way to reach people.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.400
So that's a fabulous way to reach people.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.880
And the bottom line thing is just go to where your readers are.

37:02.880 --> 37:07.840
And so what that means for me and our team is that we end up sharing our blog posts on

37:07.840 --> 37:14.880
pretty much all of these different social platforms because there's no one social platform

37:14.880 --> 37:16.840
that everybody subscribes to.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.880
And did I add Mastodon to this list?

37:18.880 --> 37:22.400
No, I need to update this and add Mastodon.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.840
I created this slide back in October.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.940
Things were a little bit different back then.

37:26.940 --> 37:33.060
But actually on most of these slides I have my Mastodon account is now listed.

37:33.060 --> 37:39.080
So Twitter is just the Claire Jordan a bit but I'm on hackyderm.io which I probably mispronounced.

37:39.080 --> 37:42.400
Okay, another tip, rinse, lather, repeat.

37:42.400 --> 37:46.920
And that just means if you're going to share it, don't be afraid to share it a few times,

37:46.920 --> 37:48.960
at different times of day.

37:48.960 --> 37:54.760
The Postgrass audience is global and something that you tweet in the morning in Europe is

37:54.760 --> 38:01.520
not going to reach people in California necessarily unless they're super night owls and vice versa.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.880
So I know a bunch of engineers were like, oh, I already tweeted it once.

38:05.880 --> 38:09.760
I don't want to pollute my profile with it more than once.

38:09.760 --> 38:15.200
But if you want to reach your friends, you're going to have to hit different time zones.

38:15.200 --> 38:20.200
And just keep in mind that only like one statistically, only one to 2% of your Twitter followers would

38:20.200 --> 38:21.600
see a given tweet.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.920
I don't actually know what that statistic is on Mastodon.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.600
Yeah, Devram, do you want me to go faster?

38:27.600 --> 38:35.400
Yeah, the number may be lower now.

38:35.400 --> 38:39.580
Things are definitely changing in the Twitter world.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.180
An example of rinse, lather, repeat too.

38:43.180 --> 38:48.040
Some of my colleagues, my boss actually, was interviewed on Azure Friday which is this

38:48.040 --> 38:53.960
wonderful video show put on by Scott Hanselman who I think is a fabulous human being.

38:53.960 --> 39:00.600
And the person in charge of the Azure Friday show tweeted about it multiple times but with

39:00.600 --> 39:03.720
different graphics each time and different words each time.

39:03.720 --> 39:07.920
And I actually think that's a good technique because the different graphics are bound to

39:07.920 --> 39:09.720
appeal to different people.

39:09.720 --> 39:16.080
I mean, I suppose it's not unlike Netflix having different graphics that they use to

39:16.080 --> 39:21.320
promote a movie and something that appeals to Boris is not necessarily going to be what

39:21.320 --> 39:22.560
appeals to me.

39:22.560 --> 39:27.000
So I bet we see different graphics for these various shows.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.400
All right, and you can keep your Twitter momentum by recycling tweets.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.400
The same is true on Mastodon as well.

39:33.400 --> 39:38.640
So just, you know, you can quote tweet on Twitter and not on Mastodon yet.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.520
Your mileage may vary but it's super effective.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.680
And also having other people on the team share it.

39:45.680 --> 39:52.440
So for example, let's see, I think Devroom took something that I tweeted recently and

39:52.440 --> 39:56.360
then he quote tweeted it and it reached a ton more people as a result.

39:56.360 --> 40:02.480
So just keep recycling it and eventually you will hit more people.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.560
On Reddit, it's super important to be there for the Q&A.

40:05.560 --> 40:10.200
Like most of the moderators will say that one-way promotion is considered advertising.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.920
They don't like that and then you can end up getting blocked by the mods explicitly

40:14.920 --> 40:18.880
or by the bots, you know, sometimes by mistake.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.520
And so, but if you go in there and you make a comment and you say, hey, we're here to

40:22.520 --> 40:28.600
answer questions, let's discuss this and you facilitate a conversation, that's quite welcome.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.600
And so, but then you have to be willing to participate.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.920
And there were a ton of questions on this particular topic when we open sourced Citus

40:35.920 --> 40:37.120
last year.

40:37.120 --> 40:40.800
And so Yelta had a lot of work to do to get answers to those questions.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.960
Five minutes left.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.520
Number seven is that Karma is a two-way street.

40:45.520 --> 40:52.160
So if you want your Postgres colleagues or people who work on the same team as you to

40:52.160 --> 41:00.280
help spread the word on some blog post that you've written, turn the table around and

41:00.280 --> 41:04.880
help them when they've got something new and that they're publishing and they're trying

41:04.880 --> 41:06.960
to get it out there.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.440
And that's something that I think we all should do more of.

41:10.440 --> 41:19.320
The more we help amplify each other's work on Postgres and on Citus, the more people

41:19.320 --> 41:24.200
will discover what's going on, learn about it, become an expert in it and join the community.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.640
Again, another set of tips.

41:26.640 --> 41:30.600
And here for promotion, your checklist, like your mileage is going to vary.

41:30.600 --> 41:35.060
So I didn't give an explicit checklist because what you want to do is going to be different

41:35.060 --> 41:38.720
based on whatever part of the database you're working on.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.160
So you'll have to create your own promotion checklist, but hopefully these tips will be

41:42.160 --> 41:43.280
helpful.

41:43.280 --> 41:48.480
And I put it all together here because the devil is in the details and there is a lot

41:48.480 --> 41:50.160
to do.

41:50.160 --> 41:54.880
And if there's one thing you're going to remember from this talk today, it should be to have

41:54.880 --> 41:55.880
empathy for your readers.

41:55.880 --> 42:00.520
And if you do that, you're more likely to write in a conversational tone of voice, speak

42:00.520 --> 42:07.680
to you, make things scannable, readable, simple, take the time to explain things, prioritize

42:07.680 --> 42:10.640
and care about your reader more than you care about yourself.

42:10.640 --> 42:15.240
There were a whole bunch of people who helped me and inspired me in writing this talk, so

42:15.240 --> 42:18.840
I had to throw that slide up there to thank them.

42:18.840 --> 42:24.160
And there is a feedback link for all of the talks here in the Postgres dev room.

42:24.160 --> 42:29.920
So if you go into FOSTEM.org, 2023 schedule, and you go to the Postgres dev room track,

42:29.920 --> 42:33.560
you can see all of our talks listed and you can click on any one of them.

42:33.560 --> 42:36.560
And in the bottom left, there's a submit feedback link.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.480
And I don't know how many of you generally give feedback on your FOSTEM talk.

42:40.480 --> 42:42.560
Show of hands.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.120
Okay.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.960
Let's try to increase that number this year.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.220
Because it's super helpful.

42:48.220 --> 42:52.560
People pour a lot of energy into creating these talks and organizing the dev room, and

42:52.560 --> 42:55.440
we would love to get your feedback.

42:55.440 --> 42:59.440
I put my addresses up there on Mastodon and on Twitter.

42:59.440 --> 43:04.680
If any of you want to follow me, I will be posting a link to the slides on both of those

43:04.680 --> 43:11.920
accounts and I put the CITIS GitHub repo on there, too, so that if it is something that

43:11.920 --> 43:15.640
you appreciate, you can be sure to drop it a star as well.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.000
And then I know that we need to move on to the next talk.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.480
I think I'm out of time.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.480
So I don't know.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
Do we have any time for questions?

43:21.480 --> 43:22.480
Okay.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.360
So we have a few minutes for questions.

43:24.360 --> 43:31.240
I also wanted to say that I have some Postgres and some CITIS database socks up here.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.240
I have 40 pairs.

43:32.240 --> 43:38.680
I also have a whole bunch of stickers of the CITIS open source mascot, too.

43:38.680 --> 43:43.280
So feel free to come and get them afterwards and wear them in good health.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.040
But first questions?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
Any?

43:46.040 --> 44:01.880
So, great talk.

44:01.880 --> 44:07.000
Many folks have strong opinions about certain things to a point like some people take religiously

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
certain stuff.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.080
And when you are in the edit cycle, would you eliminate such pieces of information that

44:13.080 --> 44:20.400
will cause a sparking reaction from such folks, or would you let the disagreement ensue because

44:20.400 --> 44:23.200
knowing that disagreement is information?

44:23.200 --> 44:27.560
So what should one do in such certain situation when they want to have such pieces of information

44:27.560 --> 44:29.080
in their blog post?

44:29.080 --> 44:30.800
I think that's a really good question.

44:30.800 --> 44:35.800
So where's the line between having an opinion on something, right?

44:35.800 --> 44:41.520
An opinion that might be unique in your own and being offensive perhaps to other groups

44:41.520 --> 44:44.160
or hurtful or overly critical.

44:44.160 --> 44:48.240
And I kind of use the code of conduct as my guide.

44:48.240 --> 44:55.000
How far have I stepped from expressing my opinion into trashing somebody else's opinion?

44:55.000 --> 44:59.200
I think I'd fall back on that.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.480
Other questions?

45:02.480 --> 45:06.880
There's one behind you, Jimmy.

45:06.880 --> 45:12.760
It's a small question, but what's the different tips you can say about presenting something

45:12.760 --> 45:15.680
in your team to your colleagues, whatever?

45:15.680 --> 45:22.720
It's not blogging something, but still it's a lot of things you mentioned here and etc.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.760
Maybe you have some tips there as well to say.

45:25.760 --> 45:30.840
I do, but there's no way I could answer that question succinctly in the time that we have.

45:30.840 --> 45:36.160
But I will say that a lot of these same tips about communicating in the format of a blog

45:36.160 --> 45:42.120
also make a lot of sense in the format of a presentation, right?

45:42.120 --> 45:46.920
It's just, for example, the white space that I talked about in your blog, that breathing

45:46.920 --> 45:50.480
room, it's the pause when you're giving a talk.

45:50.480 --> 45:55.280
It's the taking a moment to speak slowly when you're giving a talk, for example.

45:55.280 --> 46:00.440
I also a big fan of spreading things out on multiple slides so that any one slide only

46:00.440 --> 46:03.600
says one thing versus having a lot of noise up there.

46:03.600 --> 46:07.880
So the signal to noise ratio lesson is the same in both too.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.200
Okay.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.200
Another question.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.200
Hey.

46:11.200 --> 46:14.960
Oh, and just be careful with the seats, people, when you sit down.

46:14.960 --> 46:16.360
It's very loud.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
Go for it.

46:17.360 --> 46:22.080
So I'm a personal blogger and let's say I don't have all the resources to promote on

46:22.080 --> 46:28.320
all the possible websites, radio, hacker news, post to Twitter.

46:28.320 --> 46:35.000
So if I can choose, let's say, two or three major promotion resources, what's your advice

46:35.000 --> 46:36.480
for choosing them?

46:36.480 --> 46:40.080
Which social platforms to pick if you only have time to publish on a few of them?

46:40.080 --> 46:41.080
Is that the question?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
Yeah.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.600
Like, shall I choose radio, hacker news, or things like that?

46:44.600 --> 46:46.280
I can't prescribe that for you.

46:46.280 --> 46:49.180
What I would recommend is that you experiment, right?

46:49.180 --> 46:54.560
Because it depends on where your friends are, who your customers and users are, where they

46:54.560 --> 46:55.560
are.

46:55.560 --> 47:00.640
And that advice about go to where your audience is, that's where you need to go.

47:00.640 --> 47:06.520
And so you might try these two first and then try these two another time.

47:06.520 --> 47:12.640
I also don't think I would just give a particular social platform one chance because it might

47:12.640 --> 47:17.080
be the right platform for you, but you post it at the wrong time of day or the wrong day

47:17.080 --> 47:18.200
of week.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.560
So I think you're just going to have to experiment a little bit there.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.160
Thank you.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.840
Any other questions or are we out of time, Jimmy?

47:24.840 --> 47:28.360
No, we've got three, two minutes?

47:28.360 --> 47:30.360
Okay.

47:30.360 --> 47:33.080
Karen has a question.

47:33.080 --> 47:37.760
I'll repeat the question if you want.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.920
Hey, thank you very much.

47:40.920 --> 47:47.040
I didn't manage to catch your talk last time you did it, so I'm really glad I was here

47:47.040 --> 47:48.040
today.

47:48.040 --> 47:52.920
Lots of us in IT, from speaking to many people, don't find it natural to promote ourselves

47:52.920 --> 48:01.240
or to put ourselves out there and write blog posts and promote our tweets and things.

48:01.240 --> 48:05.080
Have you got specific advice for that?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.640
That is a really good question.

48:06.640 --> 48:11.640
And I struggle with it because it's back to why I made that karma point, too.

48:11.640 --> 48:17.080
Sometimes people also have trouble promoting their teammates' work because that might be

48:17.080 --> 48:19.840
seen as too self-serving also.

48:19.840 --> 48:25.720
But the fact is, if we want the Postgres community to grow, if we want the information

48:25.720 --> 48:30.920
that we're sharing to get out there, then we kind of do have to promote it.

48:30.920 --> 48:38.280
And I don't know how to really address that concern except to suggest that you just have

48:38.280 --> 48:40.320
to let it go.

48:40.320 --> 48:41.400
We just have to do it.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.880
You have to see it as part of the job.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.560
It does become more comfortable over time.

48:46.560 --> 48:50.040
It's not unlike anything with practice.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.440
And you know what will happen?

48:51.440 --> 48:56.120
When you promote something and you get the feedback from someone, Pavlo sends you a note

48:56.120 --> 48:58.400
and says, hey, that was really useful.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.920
I especially like the bit about this.

49:00.920 --> 49:05.080
And then your brain starts to connect the dots like, oh, Pavlo wouldn't have even known

49:05.080 --> 49:07.200
about it if I hadn't shared it.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.320
Okay, maybe sharing is a good thing.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.320
I don't know.

49:10.320 --> 49:14.800
So you get the positive validation and that might help.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.880
Any other questions?

49:16.880 --> 49:19.520
Very, very quick.

49:19.520 --> 49:23.640
How to cope with imposter syndrome?

49:23.640 --> 49:27.040
Because it's something I feel and I think about Brian.

49:27.040 --> 49:30.120
How to cope with imposter syndrome is the question.

49:30.120 --> 49:32.200
And it's a really good question.

49:32.200 --> 49:38.160
I think a lot more people feel imposter syndrome than we realize.

49:38.160 --> 49:42.840
I bet there's a lot of speakers here at FOSDIM who are experts in their field that maybe

49:42.840 --> 49:47.640
felt like imposters as they were walking into the building today and wondering why they're

49:47.640 --> 49:50.000
the ones giving the talk.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.160
I'm not a psychologist, so I don't think I have a good answer except to say that you're

49:54.160 --> 49:55.760
not alone.

49:55.760 --> 50:01.400
And everybody has a story to tell and everybody has a unique point of view and lessons and

50:01.400 --> 50:24.100
ria and just share.
