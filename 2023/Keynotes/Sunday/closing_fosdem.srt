1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.440
So, that was a blast.

2
0:00:09.440 --> 0:00:11.500
And we are finally back in person.

3
0:00:11.500 --> 0:00:16.160
And also I'm going to take a picture because we are finally in person.

4
0:00:16.160 --> 0:00:21.880
Once again, if you leave, please be quiet because it is extremely loud up here.

5
0:00:21.880 --> 0:00:26.000
And no, you're not special enough that you should keep talking.

6
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:29.480
Thank you very much.

7
0:00:29.480 --> 0:00:43.520
So it's a wrap.

8
0:00:43.520 --> 0:00:47.480
Random stats because stats are fun and easy to make.

9
0:00:47.480 --> 0:00:49.800
Sometimes it was a little bit of a rush.

10
0:00:49.800 --> 0:00:55.600
Our peak this time was 1.5 gigs in concurrent outgoing streams.

11
0:00:55.600 --> 0:00:59.600
Once again, please quiet if you decide to leave.

12
0:00:59.600 --> 0:01:03.840
Last year we had 1.65 gigabits peak and that was fully online.

13
0:01:03.840 --> 0:01:09.720
So that gives you a rough idea of how many people still chose to consume offsite even

14
0:01:09.720 --> 0:01:16.280
though we have a relatively full foster but not as packed as 2020 we think, we estimate.

15
0:01:16.280 --> 0:01:26.760
35 rooms, 800 concurrent viewers and roughly 20K unique viewers on the streams.

16
0:01:26.760 --> 0:01:31.320
We have a total of almost 400 hours of scheduled video for the ones tracking the numbers over

17
0:01:31.320 --> 0:01:36.360
the years that is less than the last two years because physical ULB has less space and less

18
0:01:36.360 --> 0:01:43.240
staff rooms than fully virtual but still we managed to fit quite some stuff in.

19
0:01:43.240 --> 0:01:49.320
We already have 53 released videos online and 21 are currently being reviewed and or

20
0:01:49.320 --> 0:01:54.760
transcoding for a total of almost one full day of video.

21
0:01:54.760 --> 0:02:00.760
Speaking of video, if you are a speaker or if you are a deaf room manager, please, please,

22
0:02:00.760 --> 0:02:03.920
please, please, please with sugar on top.

23
0:02:03.920 --> 0:02:08.280
You get those emails and you do what is in those emails and please help us review them

24
0:02:08.280 --> 0:02:13.560
because if you don't do it as a speaker, it falls on the deaf room managers to do it and

25
0:02:13.560 --> 0:02:18.640
if the deaf room managers don't do it, it falls on staff to do it and it's a lot of

26
0:02:18.640 --> 0:02:21.840
work and a lot of video because 400 hours of video is a lot.

27
0:02:21.840 --> 0:02:25.560
So please, if you are a speaker, if you are a deaf room manager, those emails are important.

28
0:02:25.560 --> 0:02:26.560
Do not ignore them.

29
0:02:26.560 --> 0:02:32.920
If you have any issues, email video at Fosdomorg and they come from no reply at Fosdomorg.

30
0:02:32.920 --> 0:02:37.040
Matrix also dropped because obviously a lot of people are in person but still we had quite

31
0:02:37.040 --> 0:02:43.440
some online participation slash online synchronisation while people were rocking the hallway track

32
0:02:43.440 --> 0:02:46.320
and attending talks and such.

33
0:02:46.320 --> 0:02:47.440
We sold out of Schwag.

34
0:02:47.440 --> 0:02:49.240
We weren't fully certain.

35
0:02:49.240 --> 0:02:53.000
We didn't know what we have a fully packed UOB, what we have almost nothing, anything

36
0:02:53.000 --> 0:02:56.960
in between but we managed to sell out so that's good.

37
0:02:56.960 --> 0:02:59.080
And we also had 130 advance orders.

38
0:02:59.080 --> 0:03:05.800
For those who don't know, we will continue to give you the ability to order Schwag beforehand

39
0:03:05.800 --> 0:03:09.360
which means you just get a voucher and you get a password and you get to front desk and

40
0:03:09.360 --> 0:03:10.440
you get it immediately.

41
0:03:10.440 --> 0:03:12.880
We don't have to do the payment, dance, everything.

42
0:03:12.880 --> 0:03:17.940
And also maybe depending on how the timeline works out, maybe we even can start ordering

43
0:03:17.940 --> 0:03:23.160
specifically for you as you do advance orders.

44
0:03:23.160 --> 0:03:24.600
There was a lot of food consumed.

45
0:03:24.600 --> 0:03:29.280
There's actually two slides.

46
0:03:29.280 --> 0:03:32.280
It's a lot.

47
0:03:32.280 --> 0:03:46.920
And it's not even a full number because this is as of 1530 local.

48
0:03:46.920 --> 0:03:50.520
Once again, thank you, it's really loud.

49
0:03:50.520 --> 0:03:53.880
Network we stopped checking Mac addresses for various reasons.

50
0:03:53.880 --> 0:03:57.920
Network was a little bit of a mess this year because a lot of things broke which we thought

51
0:03:57.920 --> 0:04:03.880
remotely were fine but the Macs concurrent we saw for IPv6 addresses being assigned was

52
0:04:03.880 --> 0:04:09.280
over 30K and the total amount which we gave out was 53K.

53
0:04:09.280 --> 0:04:11.880
People switched from one network to the other, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

54
0:04:11.880 --> 0:04:18.000
So it's not a fully scientific method and also privacy extensions which keep basically

55
0:04:18.000 --> 0:04:24.840
messing up all our stats but it's at least not a little.

56
0:04:24.840 --> 0:04:32.400
Also UAB has some traffic analysis on their controllers we don't for obvious privacy reasons.

57
0:04:32.400 --> 0:04:37.560
So you can guess what for the first time since they installed that stuff was the top website

58
0:04:37.560 --> 0:04:43.880
or the top site accessed by total volume of data going to and back.

59
0:04:43.880 --> 0:04:44.880
Any guesses?

60
0:04:44.880 --> 0:05:02.400
Obviously.

61
0:05:02.400 --> 0:05:04.080
We also had some stats.

62
0:05:04.080 --> 0:05:08.400
Initially we kept them at 2.5 but we switched from one gig to 10 gig over the weekend because

63
0:05:08.400 --> 0:05:10.480
that's how we rock.

64
0:05:10.480 --> 0:05:15.960
And we actually managed to consume more than the one gigabit which we had before.

65
0:05:15.960 --> 0:05:19.760
Going forward hopefully next year we will maybe even have two times 10 gig.

66
0:05:19.760 --> 0:05:22.560
We'll see.

67
0:05:22.560 --> 0:05:27.800
If you are and I keep telling people this every year if you are still using 2.4 gigahertz

68
0:05:27.800 --> 0:05:30.560
please don't.

69
0:05:30.560 --> 0:05:37.920
Get hardware which does 5G, 5 gigahertz, well 5G, no, 5 gigahertz, of course you will have

70
0:05:37.920 --> 0:05:38.920
less contention.

71
0:05:38.920 --> 0:05:43.040
You won't have zero contention but you will have less contention if you have hardware

72
0:05:43.040 --> 0:05:44.840
with 5 gigahertz.

73
0:05:44.840 --> 0:05:49.160
It's generally nicer so if you buy your next laptop your next would ever consider spending

74
0:05:49.160 --> 0:05:52.920
a little bit more money on 5 gigahertz.

75
0:05:52.920 --> 0:05:53.920
We come to thank yous.

76
0:05:53.920 --> 0:06:05.920
First of all the matrix and element people.

77
0:06:05.920 --> 0:06:10.080
Who asked to not be named just like so listed.

78
0:06:10.080 --> 0:06:19.720
Also Libera chat staff.

79
0:06:19.720 --> 0:06:31.080
And also sponsors without whose this wouldn't be possible.

80
0:06:31.080 --> 0:06:37.480
As per usual as I call out the next groups if you wear a colored T-shirt of the appropriate

81
0:06:37.480 --> 0:06:41.760
color, please come up front and take your applause.

82
0:06:41.760 --> 0:06:43.240
I'm not crying again.

83
0:06:43.240 --> 0:06:44.240
I'll see.

84
0:06:44.240 --> 0:06:45.240
All the volunteers.

85
0:06:45.240 --> 0:06:46.240
Come.

86
0:06:46.240 --> 0:07:02.040
All the volunteers.

87
0:07:02.040 --> 0:07:17.840
All the volunteers.

88
0:07:17.840 --> 0:07:44.600
I also see at least one green and one orange shirt which is not up front which is a big

89
0:07:44.600 --> 0:07:49.040
mistake.

90
0:07:49.040 --> 0:08:02.720
If you don't have the shirt on but you did volunteering,

91
0:08:02.720 --> 0:08:22.000
and whatever, please come up front.

92
0:08:22.000 --> 0:08:43.240
We have a few staff who are also supposed to come up front now.

93
0:08:43.240 --> 0:08:44.240
And thank you.

94
0:08:44.240 --> 0:09:01.200
As per always, please send feedback.

95
0:09:01.200 --> 0:09:03.800
We really rely on this feedback and we actually take it to heart.

96
0:09:03.800 --> 0:09:06.200
So please send any and all feedback which you have.

97
0:09:06.200 --> 0:09:12.360
We cannot always accommodate it but we read everything and we really do take it to heart.

98
0:09:12.360 --> 0:09:21.760
Thank you.

99
0:09:21.760 --> 0:09:24.240
That should be helping, not feedback, whatever.

100
0:09:24.240 --> 0:09:26.520
If you see trash, here, anywhere else.

101
0:09:26.520 --> 0:09:30.880
Congratulations, this is your trash now.

102
0:09:30.880 --> 0:09:32.120
And I'm being serious.

103
0:09:32.120 --> 0:09:36.820
It is an immense amount of work to build up in basically half a day on Friday and also

104
0:09:36.820 --> 0:09:40.620
to tear down within two to four hours on Sunday.

105
0:09:40.620 --> 0:09:45.160
So anything you see, please just take it with you, throw it in the trash, whatever, but

106
0:09:45.160 --> 0:09:47.200
please help us clean.

107
0:09:47.200 --> 0:09:50.920
Also speaking of cleaning, if you have some time, we would highly appreciate it if you

108
0:09:50.920 --> 0:09:53.960
just stayed around a little bit, helped us clean up.

109
0:09:53.960 --> 0:09:58.440
If you gather here, we will tell you what to do and it will take a little bit until

110
0:09:58.440 --> 0:10:00.220
we have all you segmented.

111
0:10:00.220 --> 0:10:06.560
But we can use every single hand for the network cabling which you tear out under guidance.

112
0:10:06.560 --> 0:10:09.080
You can keep the network cable.

113
0:10:09.080 --> 0:10:12.960
And also for the ones who stay until the very end and help until the very end, we will feed

114
0:10:12.960 --> 0:10:14.440
you in cabling at the end.

115
0:10:14.440 --> 0:10:18.520
So please consider just coming up front to help.

116
0:10:18.520 --> 0:10:22.280
Yes, after the thing, obviously.

117
0:10:22.280 --> 0:10:23.280
And that's it.

118
0:10:23.280 --> 0:10:24.680
So see you next year.

119
0:10:24.680 --> 0:10:39.000
And as is tradition.

120
0:10:39.000 --> 0:10:40.880
And as is tradition.

121
0:10:40.880 --> 0:10:43.320
So A, I forgot all the speakers who are in here.

122
0:10:43.320 --> 0:10:46.000
They also are supposed to be on stage if they so choose.

123
0:10:46.000 --> 0:10:48.560
So now is the time to come on stage if you want to.

124
0:10:48.560 --> 0:10:53.800
And as is tradition, we are ending Fostom with the Fostom dance.

125
0:10:53.800 --> 0:10:56.000
My knee is kind of broken.

126
0:10:56.000 --> 0:10:57.760
So I'm not going to lead the dance.

127
0:10:57.760 --> 0:11:00.240
Wouter is going to lead the dance.

128
0:11:00.240 --> 0:11:02.160
And with that, thank you.

129
0:11:02.160 --> 0:11:10.920
See you next year.

130
0:11:10.920 --> 0:11:14.440
I don't know who among you has done the Fostom dance before.

131
0:11:14.440 --> 0:11:18.480
It's actually quite difficult.

132
0:11:18.480 --> 0:11:19.680
But not really.

133
0:11:19.680 --> 0:11:22.760
We start like this.

134
0:11:22.760 --> 0:11:25.760
And it's difficult because you have to balance on one leg.

135
0:11:25.760 --> 0:11:27.920
But I'm sure you can all do that, right?

136
0:11:27.920 --> 0:11:34.960
So bear with me, and then we lift the one leg.

137
0:11:34.960 --> 0:11:39.080
And then we start moving.

138
0:11:39.080 --> 0:11:40.080
Everybody move.

139
0:11:40.080 --> 0:11:41.080
And we go faster.

140
0:11:41.080 --> 0:11:42.080
And there we go.

141
0:11:42.080 --> 0:11:43.080
We're dancing.

142
0:11:43.080 --> 0:11:44.080
Thank you.

143
0:11:44.080 --> 0:12:01.080
That was the official Fostom dance.

144
0:12:14.080 --> 0:12:15.080
Thank you.
