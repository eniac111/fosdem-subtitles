0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:18.560
I am a software engineer at Colabora.

2
0:00:18.560 --> 0:00:22.240
I just recently joined them.

3
0:00:22.240 --> 0:00:28.960
This is my first conference and I am not very good in English, so forgive me if I say something

4
0:00:28.960 --> 0:00:29.960
wrong.

5
0:00:29.960 --> 0:00:36.920
I will speak about the footnotes in multi column sections.

6
0:00:36.920 --> 0:00:45.000
I worked on this last year, a year ago.

7
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:49.160
I thought it can be an interesting problem.

8
0:00:49.160 --> 0:00:55.120
Oh, I had to go back.

9
0:00:55.120 --> 0:01:02.960
So I got a back ticket to a fix and it was a very simple ticket at first sight.

10
0:01:02.960 --> 0:01:10.160
It was only just one line text and some way the writer displayed it as two pages and why

11
0:01:10.160 --> 0:01:14.880
the word was displayed just one page.

12
0:01:14.880 --> 0:01:21.160
Beside the one line text there was a footnote and its section has two columns and there

13
0:01:21.160 --> 0:01:24.400
was a continuous section break.

14
0:01:24.400 --> 0:01:32.280
First I thought it was a problem about the section break, some way it changed to a page

15
0:01:32.280 --> 0:01:33.920
break or something like that.

16
0:01:33.920 --> 0:01:36.000
But that was an instinct.

17
0:01:36.000 --> 0:01:43.640
It was a strange thing why the footnote and the column were needed.

18
0:01:43.640 --> 0:01:53.760
If I deleted any of them, then the writer changed to one page and it was okay.

19
0:01:53.760 --> 0:01:56.100
It was changed why it is needed.

20
0:01:56.100 --> 0:02:06.760
So I started to debug to find where it's become two page and I found the problem in the layout

21
0:02:06.760 --> 0:02:18.320
in calculation and there was even a comment about it stating that the footnote container

22
0:02:18.320 --> 0:02:22.960
causes to maximize size in this case.

23
0:02:22.960 --> 0:02:37.480
This function to maximize function will calculate if we have to maximize the column frame, the

24
0:02:37.480 --> 0:02:41.240
whole section frame to the whole page.

25
0:02:41.240 --> 0:02:50.840
And it has several conditions like is footnote at end and is end note at end.

26
0:02:50.840 --> 0:03:03.160
They are check boxes on the GUI named collect at end of text and call at end of section

27
0:03:03.160 --> 0:03:04.160
for end notes.

28
0:03:04.160 --> 0:03:07.160
They are diverse falls in this case.

29
0:03:07.160 --> 0:03:11.480
Oh, the hasfollow isn't matter now.

30
0:03:11.480 --> 0:03:14.360
It was falls in this case too.

31
0:03:14.360 --> 0:03:20.680
But there was another function that contains footnote container.

32
0:03:20.680 --> 0:03:31.160
I checked this function and this function just blindly check if the section have column

33
0:03:31.160 --> 0:03:38.520
frame tried that has a footnote container frame tried and if it has one, then it returned

34
0:03:38.520 --> 0:03:40.560
the first one it found.

35
0:03:40.560 --> 0:03:48.540
So it seems the function was directly righted like this way.

36
0:03:48.540 --> 0:03:56.400
So the question was why do we want to break a page in this case?

37
0:03:56.400 --> 0:04:02.720
I even checked the git who changed it or something like that.

38
0:04:02.720 --> 0:04:13.040
But it was in the very first commit I could reach in the initial import at 2000 years.

39
0:04:13.040 --> 0:04:15.440
And nobody changed it.

40
0:04:15.440 --> 0:04:21.760
And I was even wonder why this many condition is needed.

41
0:04:21.760 --> 0:04:30.400
Not just the first one I found, but the note collect at end is still needed for it.

42
0:04:30.400 --> 0:04:36.720
For this I had to analyze the frames how they work.

43
0:04:36.720 --> 0:04:43.960
So I listed the frames related to footnote some case.

44
0:04:43.960 --> 0:04:49.280
The footnote frame is for one footnote entity.

45
0:04:49.280 --> 0:04:53.600
It can contain a text frame.

46
0:04:53.600 --> 0:04:59.640
And this can be in a footnote container frame.

47
0:04:59.640 --> 0:05:07.040
And that frame contains a list of footnotes.

48
0:05:07.040 --> 0:05:10.440
It's important it's not two-dimensional list.

49
0:05:10.440 --> 0:05:14.840
It's just a simple list that it can display.

50
0:05:14.840 --> 0:05:24.960
And this footnote container frame can be in a page frame or a column frame.

51
0:05:24.960 --> 0:05:33.880
So what is important in it that the footnote container frame does not really support columns.

52
0:05:33.880 --> 0:05:39.920
It just a I could say just one column of footnotes and that's all.

53
0:05:39.920 --> 0:05:46.680
But we can put this container frame in any of the column frame event.

54
0:05:46.680 --> 0:05:55.720
So if we put this container frames in every column frame then it will seems like if we

55
0:05:55.720 --> 0:06:05.680
support oh sorry it's like we support multi columns.

56
0:06:05.680 --> 0:06:13.960
So in one case we want footnote like multi columns as like it in the word.

57
0:06:13.960 --> 0:06:21.480
In the other case we want if we don't check the collected and text we want the footnote

58
0:06:21.480 --> 0:06:23.040
to be at the page end.

59
0:06:23.040 --> 0:06:29.680
In the other case we want the footnote to be in the columns end in physical as we say

60
0:06:29.680 --> 0:06:31.120
in the display.

61
0:06:31.120 --> 0:06:36.620
And it can be true only if the column end is equal to the page end.

62
0:06:36.620 --> 0:06:42.920
So that's why they maximize the size of the column to the page size.

63
0:06:42.920 --> 0:06:52.640
In our case it's not a good idea because in my test case there was only one footnote

64
0:06:52.640 --> 0:06:58.460
and it doesn't need to be multi columns.

65
0:06:58.460 --> 0:07:13.480
But if we wouldn't do this what I showed in the previous slide there could be a contradiction

66
0:07:13.480 --> 0:07:17.760
like I made a test document.

67
0:07:17.760 --> 0:07:19.040
There is two section.

68
0:07:19.040 --> 0:07:28.520
I checked the collected end of text which means I want the footnote be after the section

69
0:07:28.520 --> 0:07:29.520
end.

70
0:07:29.520 --> 0:07:35.120
There is two column at the first section and three column at the second section.

71
0:07:35.120 --> 0:07:42.960
It's very good in this way but if we would change the collected end of text we would

72
0:07:42.960 --> 0:07:44.280
uncheck this.

73
0:07:44.280 --> 0:07:54.200
I mean we want all of this footnote at the end of the page then how many columns we want?

74
0:07:54.200 --> 0:07:55.200
It's a contradiction.

75
0:07:55.200 --> 0:08:07.020
We can't say that two or three because any of them could be wrong.

76
0:08:07.020 --> 0:08:17.400
So what we should need we should be able to have column children for the container frame

77
0:08:17.400 --> 0:08:31.200
because it's not should be, it must be, it just should be like words able to have indifferent

78
0:08:31.200 --> 0:08:36.040
number of columns at page as many as in the text.

79
0:08:36.040 --> 0:08:44.320
So we should have the ability for the users to choose how many columns we want in the

80
0:08:44.320 --> 0:09:13.920
footnote but we should keep the ability to, that's all, okay, sorry, it's almost end.
