00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Okay, I think we can start.

00:10.920 --> 00:16.480
Hello, my name is Shuman Kwas and I work for Collabora Productivity.

00:16.480 --> 00:22.320
Today I would like to talk about the LibreOffice kit.

00:22.320 --> 00:30.480
I named this presentation Bridge between your application and LibreOffice because LibreOffice

00:30.480 --> 00:38.680
kit is simply an API which provides a possibility to render the preview of the document.

00:38.680 --> 00:47.360
So if you want to build an app which requires rendering of some documents, you can use that.

00:47.360 --> 00:55.440
So that's the API which provides not only rendering of the documents but also we can

00:55.440 --> 01:02.040
manipulate the documents and also it gives us access to the UI components.

01:02.040 --> 01:09.120
We use LibreOffice kit in Collabora Online but also in the LibreOffice repository there

01:09.120 --> 01:17.520
is some sample application called gtki-tiled-viewer where we can see it in action.

01:17.520 --> 01:27.400
It renders the document from tiles and also allows us to do some simple modifications.

01:27.400 --> 01:35.620
The APIs are in LibreOffice kit directory and most of the crucial implementation is

01:35.620 --> 01:38.380
in desktop module.

01:38.380 --> 01:50.120
The most important part is class LibreOffice kit document which we can use to access all

01:50.120 --> 01:53.960
the functionality.

01:53.960 --> 02:03.120
Also when we get some notification from the LibreOffice code, some events because for

02:03.120 --> 02:13.240
example selection has been changed, we got the callbacks listed in LibreOffice kit.

02:13.240 --> 02:28.040
This should be completely transparent when we talk about rendering because it should

02:28.040 --> 02:33.000
be completely transparent when we compare to normal desktop application but sometimes

02:33.000 --> 02:34.480
it's not possible.

02:34.480 --> 02:42.200
So we use some conditional code for LibreOffice kit behind the Comp Helper LibreOffice kit

02:42.200 --> 02:44.280
is active flag.

02:44.280 --> 02:50.840
For example calling this mentioned callbacks is behind this guard.

02:50.840 --> 02:56.440
In this talk I would like to present some improvements in LibreOffice kit mostly in

02:56.440 --> 02:59.280
rendering the tiles.

02:59.280 --> 03:07.720
The biggest thing is the master page mode because there was a problem.

03:07.720 --> 03:14.800
In Impress we can open slides in edit mode but also we can design slides, how they look

03:14.800 --> 03:19.560
and this is called master page mode.

03:19.560 --> 03:26.560
There was a problem when we had multiple users in the same presentation and some of them

03:26.560 --> 03:37.920
were watching the master page and some of them were just editing the presentation.

03:37.920 --> 03:50.120
Sometimes we got the mixed tiles because in our API there was no explicit way to say that

03:50.120 --> 03:55.200
we want to render a tile for master page or for the normal mode.

03:55.200 --> 04:03.280
So depending on which view we selected for rendering it was completely not deterministic.

04:03.280 --> 04:10.760
So I introduced that parameter to our API so now we are sure that we will not mix tiles

04:10.760 --> 04:15.920
between different modes.

04:15.920 --> 04:21.360
Other problem I noticed was in CALC.

04:21.360 --> 04:29.680
Again it was not deterministic when we were rendering some piece of the spreadsheet because

04:29.680 --> 04:41.240
when we had two users editing content in a similar area which was covered by one tile,

04:41.240 --> 04:50.520
when one of these cells was overflowing because we had too much content to fit into the cell,

04:50.520 --> 04:57.320
it was rendered only when the view selected for rendering was the actual editor.

04:57.320 --> 05:08.040
But when other users were typing we sometimes refreshed the given fragment of the spreadsheet

05:08.040 --> 05:09.240
without that.

05:09.240 --> 05:17.400
So it was flickering and sometimes we got the right view and sometimes we got view without

05:17.400 --> 05:19.080
overflowing content.

05:19.080 --> 05:28.600
So I fixed that and now we are rendering always the same way, the same tile.

05:28.600 --> 05:37.400
So we got overflowing content in both cases and like we can see here there are two different

05:37.400 --> 05:41.720
views and both have the same content.

05:41.720 --> 05:53.080
It's very important because then client application can catch the tiles and they are the same.

05:53.080 --> 06:00.960
Other thing I improved was rendering the slide previews because in previews we don't want

06:00.960 --> 06:08.480
to attach any selections or draft changes in text fields.

06:08.480 --> 06:13.360
We want to just play plain preview of a slide.

06:13.360 --> 06:21.720
In the old code we always used one view, the first one for rendering this but it was not

06:21.720 --> 06:30.040
correct because when first user was typing something, for example in the text box, it

06:30.040 --> 06:39.520
was visible as well in the preview for other users.

06:39.520 --> 06:48.280
So now I modified the algorithm which selects a view for drawing and we prefer views which

06:48.280 --> 06:54.000
are not editing currently.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.800
Other functions which get improvements was render shape selection which is responsible

07:01.800 --> 07:12.200
for rendering the shape or image of element which is currently selected in the document.

07:12.200 --> 07:26.040
We used that for example for showing the rotation result in the real time so when user starts

07:26.040 --> 07:33.520
to drag something or rotate he see the potential results.

07:33.520 --> 07:41.720
The problem here was that when we selected some image with very very large size it was

07:41.720 --> 07:53.000
rendering the original image so it was taking sometimes few seconds and was sending megabytes

07:53.000 --> 07:55.960
just to render a preview.

07:55.960 --> 08:04.200
I optimized that a bit by setting maximal resolution we used for previews because they

08:04.200 --> 08:11.080
don't have to be as big as original images.

08:11.080 --> 08:21.200
And also from other things in the LibreOffice kit I added was exposing the formula bar widget

08:21.200 --> 08:24.120
which is present in calc.

08:24.120 --> 08:33.880
Now it sends all the events like selections or cursor movements to the client application

08:33.880 --> 08:38.880
so it can be handled there correctly because previously in Color

08:38.880 --> 08:48.960
Brown line we were using the tunneled pixel based formula bar which is not perfect for

08:48.960 --> 08:52.040
user experience.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.480
And that's all from me.

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
Thank you.

08:54.480 --> 09:04.900
