1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.240
So, welcome again. The next speaker is Bernard Puttering, known for system D, post-alveo

2
0:00:11.240 --> 0:00:16.760
and other fundamental projects. And, yeah, he will talk about his journey and learnings

3
0:00:16.760 --> 0:00:26.000
of fusing TPMs and how that is working with four image-based Linux operating systems,

4
0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:32.080
rendering boots and so on. Hi. Yeah, what he said. So, I'm going to

5
0:00:32.080 --> 0:00:36.080
talk about image-based Linux and TPMs. We don't have much time. I think it's just 20

6
0:00:36.080 --> 0:00:40.560
minutes and it's a complex topic. I already know right now that I'm not going to be able

7
0:00:40.560 --> 0:00:45.600
to finish, but, yeah, that's not too bad. I hope the slides should be online sooner or

8
0:00:45.600 --> 0:00:50.320
later. So, if we don't finish, it's not too bad. So, let's jump right in. What's an image-based

9
0:00:50.320 --> 0:00:54.360
Linux? I don't think I have to say too much about that because Luca already gave an introduction

10
0:00:54.360 --> 0:01:00.200
about this. But, yeah, it's really about having a core file system images instead of fine-grained

11
0:01:00.200 --> 0:01:03.880
images. Many benefits. I'm not going to go into detail. Here we'll focus simply on the

12
0:01:03.880 --> 0:01:10.520
relevance for building trusted systems. These images we now call DDIs. Luca had that on

13
0:01:10.520 --> 0:01:14.640
the slides as well, which is like discover a little disk image. It just means that there's

14
0:01:14.640 --> 0:01:19.400
a DPT partition table which describes what's on it and usually has a variety and things

15
0:01:19.400 --> 0:01:24.920
like that. The other thing in the title of my talk was a TPM. Yeah, I hope some of you

16
0:01:24.920 --> 0:01:29.920
have a rough idea what a TPM is. It's a security chip. Traditionally, it's a discrete one,

17
0:01:29.920 --> 0:01:33.680
but nowadays it can also be in firmware or even in software. It's a cryptographic scope

18
0:01:33.680 --> 0:01:37.600
process in a way that usually people then think, oh, it must be something fast, but

19
0:01:37.600 --> 0:01:44.040
it's usually not. It's actually terribly slow usually. But it's not what it's supposed to

20
0:01:44.040 --> 0:01:49.920
be. It's standardized, widely available, all your laptops in particular. The business laptops

21
0:01:49.920 --> 0:01:54.080
usually have it as a discrete chip. The cheaper ones nowadays have it in firmware. It's pretty

22
0:01:54.080 --> 0:01:59.160
universal. Conceptually similar to smart cards and fighter keys, right? It's a storage for

23
0:01:59.160 --> 0:02:06.640
keys, but it's also very different. Supposedly, TampaProve can store at least one key securely.

24
0:02:06.640 --> 0:02:11.600
Actually more than this, but yes, the primary purpose is there's a seed key stored on it

25
0:02:11.600 --> 0:02:16.320
and then everything else can be derived from this. That key cannot be extracted. That's

26
0:02:16.320 --> 0:02:21.280
the fun part about it. So ideally you have to have that specific chip or if you don't

27
0:02:21.280 --> 0:02:27.680
have that chip, then yeah, you can't retrieve the keys. You can do lots of things with these

28
0:02:27.680 --> 0:02:31.960
things. Most interesting, I think, is one that you can ask the TPM to encrypt and decrypt

29
0:02:31.960 --> 0:02:39.640
data ultimately with that seed key that's stored on it. So that basically means while

30
0:02:39.640 --> 0:02:46.320
you don't have that much storage on the TPM, you can see me store as many keys as you want

31
0:02:46.320 --> 0:02:52.240
with the TPM simply by wrapping that key as they say, by taking any secret key you have,

32
0:02:52.240 --> 0:02:56.360
passing it to the TPM so that it encrypts it with its own built-in seed key or some

33
0:02:56.360 --> 0:03:00.920
key derived of that. And then you get it back and you store it on disk. And so you basically

34
0:03:00.920 --> 0:03:09.560
have infinite ways how to bind keys to the TPM. What's fun about this part is that this

35
0:03:09.560 --> 0:03:15.480
encryption can involve policy. Policy basically means that you can make restrictions about

36
0:03:15.480 --> 0:03:20.800
how the key can be decrypted. For example, you can require that also pin is provided,

37
0:03:20.800 --> 0:03:24.680
right? Like a human typed in pin. Pin just means password by the way. It doesn't mean

38
0:03:24.680 --> 0:03:29.480
it has to be a number. It can also imply that system has to be in a specific state for the

39
0:03:29.480 --> 0:03:35.120
key to be decrypted. State means, for example, that specific software firmware bootloader

40
0:03:35.120 --> 0:03:42.720
runs, that the system is in a specific boot phase, that the specific disk encryption volume

41
0:03:42.720 --> 0:03:46.880
key has been used and things like that. It's via a concept called PCR. It's more about

42
0:03:46.880 --> 0:03:50.360
that. It's probably mostly we're going to actually talk about that point. It can also

43
0:03:50.360 --> 0:03:55.760
mean you can bind policy to time, right? Like so that it can specify time window when a

44
0:03:55.760 --> 0:04:01.720
key can be decrypted and prohibited otherwise. It's actually a useful feature. Sounds crazy,

45
0:04:01.720 --> 0:04:08.080
but it's actually pretty useful. Hopefully we can quickly talk about that later. The

46
0:04:08.080 --> 0:04:12.200
prior slide, that's just the TBM stuff that I find interesting that we're going to touch

47
0:04:12.200 --> 0:04:17.280
in this talk, but there's a lot more about it. Like it has an RNG. You can actually do

48
0:04:17.280 --> 0:04:22.320
store stuff there. Dictionary, tech protection, like millions of things you cannot just encrypt.

49
0:04:22.320 --> 0:04:27.400
You can sign. I don't know. I'm not going to go into detail with that. Only 20 minutes.

50
0:04:27.400 --> 0:04:31.360
These PCR policies, I want to go into detail. It's the most interesting type of access policy

51
0:04:31.360 --> 0:04:39.600
and most people who deal with TPMs have encrypted their hard disk and linked it to the TPM usually

52
0:04:39.600 --> 0:04:43.380
just played around with the PCR policies. That's something PCR is short for platform

53
0:04:43.380 --> 0:04:49.200
configuration registers. They're basically just registers like little data variables

54
0:04:49.200 --> 0:04:54.800
on the chip. Usually you have 24 of those. Initially they boot up at zero. You cannot

55
0:04:54.800 --> 0:04:59.720
set them to anything you like. The only thing you can do is you can pass some data to the

56
0:04:59.720 --> 0:05:05.720
PCR and then it's going to execute this. It will update the PCR with the number n. You

57
0:05:05.720 --> 0:05:12.640
have 24. That's 0 to 23. It will calculate a hash value of the old value plus concatenate

58
0:05:12.640 --> 0:05:18.800
with the new data. I said that it's SHA-256 because it's effectively what people use these

59
0:05:18.800 --> 0:05:24.360
days, but it actually can be anything. That's the only operation it does. That basically

60
0:05:24.360 --> 0:05:31.360
means if you pass data and later data and later data, it's going to come up with a value

61
0:05:31.360 --> 0:05:38.040
and this value is derived from all the data you pass to it. This is a way of how we can

62
0:05:38.040 --> 0:05:43.040
implement a chain of trust. This operation where you send the data to the PCR is called

63
0:05:43.040 --> 0:05:48.220
extension of the PCR or you can also say the measurement of the data depending which way

64
0:05:48.220 --> 0:05:56.460
you look. How are these PCR used on most of the laptops that you have? The firmware already

65
0:05:56.460 --> 0:06:00.760
starts writing data to it. What data does it actually write to it? Usually all the code

66
0:06:00.760 --> 0:06:05.400
it executes right before it executes it and also all the configuration for that code right

67
0:06:05.400 --> 0:06:13.520
before it makes use of this. Afterwards, the PCR has a specific value and this value you

68
0:06:13.520 --> 0:06:19.800
can then use to prove that the system went through certain stages because every part

69
0:06:19.800 --> 0:06:26.600
of the system always measures the next thing so that if every element in the chain originally

70
0:06:26.600 --> 0:06:32.320
was trusted, then it will pass on the trust and so on and so on. Nobody can change the

71
0:06:32.320 --> 0:06:38.120
past but only the future and that's how you implement a chain of trust for the formatted

72
0:06:38.120 --> 0:06:46.160
boot. The other good thing is that if you know the elements of that chain that you're

73
0:06:46.160 --> 0:06:51.960
going to measure in advance, you can pre-calculate PCR values. You can basically say offline,

74
0:06:51.960 --> 0:06:58.800
okay I'm using this firmware, this boot loader and this kernel. I can tell you what the PCR

75
0:06:58.800 --> 0:07:03.200
is going to look like ahead of time because I can actually calculate this hash operation

76
0:07:03.200 --> 0:07:11.480
myself in a very, very trivial way. You can pre-calculate PCR values. This is awesome

77
0:07:11.480 --> 0:07:18.760
because if you can pre-calculate the PCR values and these PCR values can be used in policy

78
0:07:18.760 --> 0:07:25.640
and secrets on keys that encrypt with the TPM, then you basically can say with that

79
0:07:25.640 --> 0:07:31.960
that keys can only be decrypted if the system booted up with software that I actually trust.

80
0:07:31.960 --> 0:07:41.520
That's what is kind of useful about PCR. You can do even other stuff with that but this

81
0:07:41.520 --> 0:07:50.840
is like the key takeaway. If we can bind the decryption of secrets by the TPM to the state

82
0:07:50.840 --> 0:07:57.840
of these PCR values, we can protect the secrets so that only on very specific systems running

83
0:07:57.840 --> 0:08:05.040
specific software, running specific configuration, these secrets can be recovered. For disk encryption

84
0:08:05.040 --> 0:08:14.040
that's the primary use case. Image-based OSes have this benefit that they can be measured

85
0:08:14.040 --> 0:08:22.680
as a whole. If you have the entire OS in an image, it's very easy to calculate the hash

86
0:08:22.680 --> 0:08:27.240
value of it and then it's very easy if you take that hash value and pass it to the TPM

87
0:08:27.240 --> 0:08:33.200
to know in advance what the PCR is going to be at the end when the system is fully booted

88
0:08:33.200 --> 0:08:37.320
up. This is systematically different if you have a package-based OS. In package-based

89
0:08:37.320 --> 0:08:43.280
OS, locally you create a file system. Locally you unpack all these packages and sometimes

90
0:08:43.280 --> 0:08:48.040
you update them at this time and sometimes you update them in another time. In package-based

91
0:08:48.040 --> 0:08:52.920
OSes, you would end up as a file system that is going to be widely different from everybody

92
0:08:52.920 --> 0:08:57.560
else who installed the same OS. Image-based OSes have this vulnerability because they

93
0:08:57.560 --> 0:09:02.000
are cores, they update as a whole, you can do these pre-calculations and they're going

94
0:09:02.000 --> 0:09:06.640
to have the same hash values in every single system and hence the same PCR values in every

95
0:09:06.640 --> 0:09:15.520
single system. What's also great is it's not just about hash values in the PCRs that

96
0:09:15.520 --> 0:09:20.240
eventually will show up because that sucks a little bit because it basically means that

97
0:09:20.240 --> 0:09:26.160
if you have a secret that you bind to a specific hash value and then you update the image that

98
0:09:26.160 --> 0:09:30.280
you ultimately calculated this from, then all these hash values will change. That sucks

99
0:09:30.280 --> 0:09:33.400
because it basically means that you can't update your software anymore because if you

100
0:09:33.400 --> 0:09:38.720
do, you lose access to all your secrets. Nonetheless, this is what Windows actually does. But we

101
0:09:38.720 --> 0:09:46.080
can do better and actually assign these things because if we can pre-calculate them, we know

102
0:09:46.080 --> 0:09:51.320
that this OS version is going to end up with these PCR values, then we can actually sign

103
0:09:51.320 --> 0:10:01.800
them on like the vendor can do this and provide the user both with the OS itself plus information

104
0:10:01.800 --> 0:10:09.240
about what the expected PCR is plus the signature for it, then you can actually use the TPM

105
0:10:09.240 --> 0:10:13.160
and link secrets instead to the hash values, can link them to the public key that belongs

106
0:10:13.160 --> 0:10:17.320
to the signature that you will get. This is awesome because it basically means that you

107
0:10:17.320 --> 0:10:21.800
can update as many as you want, you will not lose access to your secrets. Now I'm going

108
0:10:21.800 --> 0:10:28.720
to talk about SysTomy because I'm the SysTomy guy. Quick overview about all the TPM stuff

109
0:10:28.720 --> 0:10:33.440
we now have in the most current system dewort and it actually covers the unreleased version

110
0:10:33.440 --> 0:10:39.280
that's coming up, two, five, three. But yeah, SysTomy stub, it's a stub that like a UFI

111
0:10:39.280 --> 0:10:42.840
stub that you can glue in front of a kernel and it does measurements of the kernel that's

112
0:10:42.840 --> 0:10:47.200
about the boot. It does lots of other things but this is, yeah, for this context about

113
0:10:47.200 --> 0:10:52.320
TPMs, this is what I find interesting about it. It still runs in UFI mode before Linux

114
0:10:52.320 --> 0:10:58.520
is invoked and then passes control to Linux. There's a service system to call SysTomy PCR

115
0:10:58.520 --> 0:11:05.560
phase. What that does, it measures certain strings at specific times of the boot into

116
0:11:05.560 --> 0:11:12.080
a specific PCR. What's the purpose of this? Sometimes or I guess always it's kind of useful

117
0:11:12.080 --> 0:11:17.200
that for example the encryption key for the root volume can only be unlocked in the inner

118
0:11:17.200 --> 0:11:21.880
ID but not after. And that's an awesome property because it basically means that when somebody

119
0:11:21.880 --> 0:11:27.880
exploits your system after the root file system is actually activated, then they can't talk

120
0:11:27.880 --> 0:11:32.880
to the TPM to get the password back because basically these phaser stuff can destroy the

121
0:11:32.880 --> 0:11:37.320
PCRs and because the PCRs are now used for the policy, yeah, the key is inaccessible

122
0:11:37.320 --> 0:11:42.560
until a reboot is done and we end up in the inner ID again. There's SysTomy PCRFS. What

123
0:11:42.560 --> 0:11:47.720
that measures is like FS identity, like file system identity. That's UUIDs of the file

124
0:11:47.720 --> 0:11:52.360
system. The thinking about that is that there should be PCR where you can basically say,

125
0:11:52.360 --> 0:12:01.560
okay, that identifies a specific installation that I have. Do we use PCR15 for this? So

126
0:12:01.560 --> 0:12:06.080
basically that you can guarantee, yeah, my laptop is going to have that value there.

127
0:12:06.080 --> 0:12:11.160
My laptop is definitely going to have a different one. So it's about being able to bind policy

128
0:12:11.160 --> 0:12:16.480
to specific installations. There's SysTomy PCR machine that measures Etsy machinities.

129
0:12:16.480 --> 0:12:20.880
Etsy machinities is just an explicit system ID that we introduced a while back. SysTomy

130
0:12:20.880 --> 0:12:26.560
Crypt Setup is now something that can consume all this stuff that I was talking about there.

131
0:12:26.560 --> 0:12:31.720
These things measure. This one then actually is able to unlock disk secrets based on these

132
0:12:31.720 --> 0:12:40.640
PCR policies. There's something, yeah, it's, Crypt Setup is actually not just about making

133
0:12:40.640 --> 0:12:47.520
use of the PCR policies. It also measures a hash derived from the volume key of the

134
0:12:47.520 --> 0:12:52.040
root file system, for example, or actually can measure any volume key with that. So the

135
0:12:52.040 --> 0:12:56.080
identity, the idea is basically that the secret is also measured to DPM and that this gives

136
0:12:56.080 --> 0:13:02.720
a much stronger protection of the PCR15 stuff that I was talking about. In future, we probably

137
0:13:02.720 --> 0:13:07.680
also add something similar to SysTomy variety so that basically, yeah, you can very protect

138
0:13:07.680 --> 0:13:14.800
file systems and have the top level hash measured. Yeah, Crypt Setup can consume this. Then there's

139
0:13:14.800 --> 0:13:18.840
also SysTomy CREDS in the service manager. That's the concept we recently added SysTomy

140
0:13:18.840 --> 0:13:24.520
is basically how we can pass secrets into services and they can be encrypted via TPM

141
0:13:24.520 --> 0:13:27.840
stuff and things like that. So it's kind of useful that you basically can say, I want

142
0:13:27.840 --> 0:13:36.600
my X509 secret key encrypted in a way that it can only be unlocked on my specific server

143
0:13:36.600 --> 0:13:42.400
running my specific OS during the InnoDartie brute phase but not later or something like

144
0:13:42.400 --> 0:13:50.360
this. SysTomy measure is a tool that can pre-calculate expected PCR values for UKIs. UKI is the unified

145
0:13:50.360 --> 0:13:54.360
kernel images. We had talked about that before so I'm not going to explain that. You can also

146
0:13:54.360 --> 0:13:59.480
sign them so that you can basically have a UKI that carries both like the signature along

147
0:13:59.480 --> 0:14:05.000
with it so that then later people can just make use of this to unlock their volumes.

148
0:14:05.000 --> 0:14:13.920
There's a recently added tool, UKifi, I don't know how we supposed to pronounce that yet.

149
0:14:13.920 --> 0:14:18.160
But anyway, it builds on SysTomy matter and a couple of other tools and you give it just

150
0:14:18.160 --> 0:14:23.040
the components, it builds the UKI stuff, signs it with security, it signs it with the SysTomy

151
0:14:23.040 --> 0:14:27.080
measure and then you have this one blob that you can ultimately deploy. The net result

152
0:14:27.080 --> 0:14:36.280
of this is three relevant PCRs. In 11 we're going to America the kernel and the root file

153
0:14:36.280 --> 0:14:40.320
system into. In PCR 12 there's going to be basically the configuration you pass to the

154
0:14:40.320 --> 0:14:46.080
kernel that's primarily kernel and parameters and things like that but it's also more like

155
0:14:46.080 --> 0:14:49.880
we have this credentials concept that I mentioned is going to measure it into that if they are

156
0:14:49.880 --> 0:14:57.600
passed into the system and we'll have soon something called sys cfg which is like a secure

157
0:14:57.600 --> 0:15:03.760
way how you can manage Etsy stuff. It's also going to be measured into that. Then PCR 15

158
0:15:03.760 --> 0:15:09.360
I mentioned it's kind of the identity of the local system. Then you can consume this and

159
0:15:09.360 --> 0:15:13.080
I mentioned this already with system decrypt and roll. There where you can basically say

160
0:15:13.080 --> 0:15:20.000
now this disk can only be unlocked on a system that has physical access to this very TPM,

161
0:15:20.000 --> 0:15:25.520
so to hardware, that can only be locked if it's booted with properly signed OS, UKIs and

162
0:15:25.520 --> 0:15:32.480
OS, DDIs by a specific render. I can say I install Fedora here and this secret key shell

163
0:15:32.480 --> 0:15:38.320
only be unlocked ever if it's actually Fedora that is booted but not if hacker OS or something

164
0:15:38.320 --> 0:15:48.480
is booted. I can say, if linked to the configuration, I can say that secrets can only be available

165
0:15:48.480 --> 0:15:52.680
during a specific boot phase. For example, in the NERD but not later. So that you know

166
0:15:52.680 --> 0:15:58.520
that if you leave your booted up laptop somewhere in your hotel room or something like that

167
0:15:58.520 --> 0:16:03.240
and you're not supervising it, that at least they'll not be able to get your root volume

168
0:16:03.240 --> 0:16:12.480
encryption key via directly talking to TPM. You can also add a pin, you can do rate limiting

169
0:16:12.480 --> 0:16:16.480
and things like that so that there's a dictionary attack protection so that people cannot just

170
0:16:16.480 --> 0:16:21.280
go and hammer the TPM trying a couple of things, trying a couple of pins or something like

171
0:16:21.280 --> 0:16:25.400
that because the TPM eventually says no, you have to wait or something or you have to provide

172
0:16:25.400 --> 0:16:34.480
an unlock pin. I'm good at time actually. So far so good. PCRs are really useful stuff

173
0:16:34.480 --> 0:16:39.720
and you're probably going to extend users them all across the system before other things.

174
0:16:39.720 --> 0:16:43.120
They have other users like remote attestation, like you can use them to basically remotely

175
0:16:43.120 --> 0:16:49.200
say like verify that a system in a specific state. People usually use that for servers

176
0:16:49.200 --> 0:16:53.480
and stuff so that if you have a cloud and you have lots of nodes that before you give

177
0:16:53.480 --> 0:16:57.440
a workload to a specific server, you can verify that still running exactly the software that

178
0:16:57.440 --> 0:17:03.320
it should be and nobody hacked with it and booted something else and things like that.

179
0:17:03.320 --> 0:17:10.520
It's also useful actually, back to the hotel situation, I leave my laptop in the hotel,

180
0:17:10.520 --> 0:17:16.520
I come back and I can use the remote attestation so that this device can prove to me that it's

181
0:17:16.520 --> 0:17:21.520
actually my device running my software as I intended and not something else. So yeah,

182
0:17:21.520 --> 0:17:29.360
configuration and images I already mentioned, credentials I already mentioned briefly. Yeah,

183
0:17:29.360 --> 0:17:32.120
last thing, Sakeboot and MagicBoot, people shouldn't confuse. MagicBoot is whatever

184
0:17:32.120 --> 0:17:36.000
I was just talking about with all the measurements like this chain of PCRs and things like that.

185
0:17:36.000 --> 0:17:40.000
There's also Sakeboot and UFI. Usually you do both, but they have different purposes,

186
0:17:40.000 --> 0:17:45.000
right? Like one is ahead of time stuff where it doesn't even allow software to boot that

187
0:17:45.000 --> 0:17:48.280
isn't signed properly. The MagicBoot is two differently, like the software can all run

188
0:17:48.280 --> 0:17:53.800
but it will not get access to secrets if it's the wrong software. Anyway, we don't have

189
0:17:53.800 --> 0:17:58.080
much time anymore. I would like to take at least some questions, so let's do that.

190
0:17:58.080 --> 0:18:06.760
Hello, so all these measurements, are they going to be an TPM event log for systemd2

191
0:18:06.760 --> 0:18:09.200
where I can debug that stuff?

192
0:18:09.200 --> 0:18:18.040
That's a good question. So yeah, we currently mentioned this to the login framework, like

193
0:18:18.040 --> 0:18:23.360
the regular Lexus log and the journal. We do not write a TPM event log. I know that

194
0:18:23.360 --> 0:18:29.200
there's a specification for actually writing a TPM event log. We totally should, but I

195
0:18:29.200 --> 0:18:33.680
didn't want to implement this Tcg spec for that yet. I didn't find a good library doing

196
0:18:33.680 --> 0:18:38.640
this that I wanted to use. But ultimately, for the remote attestation case, we absolutely

197
0:18:38.640 --> 0:18:46.720
need this. Eventually I want to get to this world where we can, before we run any service,

198
0:18:46.720 --> 0:18:51.240
any container or any VM or something, we can measure ahead of time what we do and we write

199
0:18:51.240 --> 0:18:55.880
that result to that event log and then people can consume the event log. So I think systemd

200
0:18:55.880 --> 0:18:56.880
should write that.

201
0:18:56.880 --> 0:19:02.760
I'm not a dihad fan of the format 2 work, but if you implement that stuff, we have now

202
0:19:02.760 --> 0:19:06.800
three event logs. We have the UFO one, we have the IMA one, and then now we have the

203
0:19:06.800 --> 0:19:11.280
systemd one. So it's kind of a kernel thing that actually the kernel should provide, I

204
0:19:11.280 --> 0:19:12.280
think.

205
0:19:12.280 --> 0:19:16.200
Well, I mean, it can grow indefinitely. I'm not sure you want the kernel to write stuff

206
0:19:16.200 --> 0:19:18.520
indefinitely. I don't know.

207
0:19:18.520 --> 0:19:20.800
Where is that?

208
0:19:20.800 --> 0:19:24.000
If you care about these things, I don't think we should come up with our own standard for

209
0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:29.640
this. If we write anything, it probably should be the Tcg one. But I don't know. I didn't

210
0:19:29.640 --> 0:19:32.640
look into details like rotation or whatever else.

211
0:19:32.640 --> 0:19:34.800
Okay, thanks.

212
0:19:34.800 --> 0:19:45.560
So right at the moment, systemd-crypton-role has a least privileged problem in that whenever

213
0:19:45.560 --> 0:19:49.320
you're handling cryptographic materials, you should always expose them to the least number

214
0:19:49.320 --> 0:19:55.720
of subsystems. And the problem is that systemd-crypton-role is unwrapping the TPM key and then passing

215
0:19:55.720 --> 0:20:00.880
the unwrapped key down into the kernel. But the kernel itself has a system for handling

216
0:20:00.880 --> 0:20:05.600
the unwrapping of TPM keys. So what we should be doing is passing the TPM key straight into

217
0:20:05.600 --> 0:20:10.080
the kernel and allowing the kernel to unwrap it. Are there any plans to actually implement

218
0:20:10.080 --> 0:20:11.080
that?

219
0:20:11.080 --> 0:20:15.960
I didn't know this existed. So I don't know. Is it documented anywhere?

220
0:20:15.960 --> 0:20:18.560
Yeah, it's called the trusted key subsystem.

221
0:20:18.560 --> 0:20:24.440
Yeah, I mean, yeah. So far, we don't really make much use of the curing thing because

222
0:20:24.440 --> 0:20:30.280
of complex beasts. But if it exists, I see no reason why we wouldn't use it.

223
0:20:30.280 --> 0:20:32.280
Okay, thanks.

224
0:20:32.280 --> 0:20:43.440
I have a talk on that tomorrow on trusted keys if you are interested. My question is

225
0:20:43.440 --> 0:20:48.080
about something else. You know about systems where the TPM2 communication is encrypted

226
0:20:48.080 --> 0:20:54.200
and authenticated to avoid someone disordering the TPM and missing with it.

227
0:20:54.200 --> 0:20:58.960
We do parameter encryption. And originally, it was just bound to the pin and then the

228
0:20:58.960 --> 0:21:03.680
recent version, there's some solving going on. But I think we are like, you know, the

229
0:21:03.680 --> 0:21:08.560
good thing is that nowadays, even the TPM2 SS maintainers themselves send us all the

230
0:21:08.560 --> 0:21:12.680
patches to fix these things. So I think we're pretty like, at least we're way better than

231
0:21:12.680 --> 0:21:19.440
what Windows currently does. And we keep on improving.

232
0:21:19.440 --> 0:21:31.760
Hi. How to integrate this into a GRUB boot process? So you always need so as far as I

233
0:21:31.760 --> 0:21:40.480
see, you always need an initial run file system to set up or to process all these TPM functionality

234
0:21:40.480 --> 0:21:46.480
and then initializing a looks key store and then switch route into the root file system.

235
0:21:46.480 --> 0:21:51.560
So is there a better way? You're asking me if GRUB is a better way

236
0:21:51.560 --> 0:21:59.560
for anything? You're right. We're asking the wrong guy. I think GRUB, yeah, I'm not going

237
0:21:59.560 --> 0:22:05.360
to say bad things. But you know, we have this other bootloader, like S-Sysdb. I mean, it's

238
0:22:05.360 --> 0:22:11.760
not a bootloader, it's just a boot menu, but Sdboot. And I am not a fan of GRUB and these

239
0:22:11.760 --> 0:22:16.840
things. And I systematically think it's really, really stupid to do disk encryption in GRUB

240
0:22:16.840 --> 0:22:23.440
because it's not what you want there. You want authentication, not encryption. And so

241
0:22:23.440 --> 0:22:29.120
I don't know. It's like to build a trusted boot, I'm not convinced that GRUB should be

242
0:22:29.120 --> 0:22:35.560
part of the solution. It should just like, you know, an EFI system at least if you use

243
0:22:35.560 --> 0:22:40.240
S

244
0:22:40.240 --> 0:22:44.160
another way of protecting things. I know that many distributions, if they want to, like

245
0:22:44.160 --> 0:22:48.360
because they use unencrypted, like they want to use encrypted slash boot, which I think

246
0:22:48.360 --> 0:22:54.640
is stupid, but if they do this, then yeah, of course you need to add a disk encryption

247
0:22:54.640 --> 0:22:58.720
support to GRUB. But I think the problem is you shouldn't have an encrypted boot. You

248
0:22:58.720 --> 0:23:03.520
should use UKI's and things like that. And then have your secrets come in once the internet

249
0:23:03.520 --> 0:23:08.200
already initializes and tells the system what to do. So if you ask me, is there a better

250
0:23:08.200 --> 0:23:15.200
way? No, what you're proposing is the worst way. This is the better way. So yeah.

251
0:23:15.200 --> 0:23:26.720
Thank you for your talk. Quick question. You didn't talk a lot about recovery. And I'm

252
0:23:26.720 --> 0:23:34.520
more interested in through your test, have your encounter TPM2 wearing and TPM2 dying?

253
0:23:34.520 --> 0:23:40.840
And what can happen in those situation regarding field recovery, disaster recovery and so on?

254
0:23:40.840 --> 0:23:46.080
So you know, in all the stuff we're doing, like the TPM stuff is just one option among

255
0:23:46.080 --> 0:23:52.320
many, right? Like we have multiple key slots and luck stuff. And so we added actually to

256
0:23:52.320 --> 0:23:56.520
system decrypter enroll, high level support for its concept, like recovery keys, which

257
0:23:56.520 --> 0:24:01.960
are just regular passwords. The only difference is they're generated by the system instead

258
0:24:01.960 --> 0:24:08.160
of selected by users. So they have high entropy and should be good quality. But I would say,

259
0:24:08.160 --> 0:24:11.920
yeah, if like, it's what everybody else does too, right? Like on MacOS, you can have a

260
0:24:11.920 --> 0:24:16.000
recovery key and on Windows, you can have a recovery key. And this is what we should

261
0:24:16.000 --> 0:24:22.120
do here as well, right? Like use TPMs, absolutely. And then hide entropy recovery keys, things

262
0:24:22.120 --> 0:24:27.480
are fucked up, things are fucked up. But yeah, it's a matter ultimately for the distributions

263
0:24:27.480 --> 0:24:32.400
to have a nice UI for this, right? With all of this, I kind of want to push into that

264
0:24:32.400 --> 0:24:38.200
direction that the TPM stuff is the default. And then if you want something else, like

265
0:24:38.200 --> 0:24:45.760
FIDO or whatever else you enrolled in addition to that, and that's, yeah, anyway. Thank you

266
0:24:45.760 --> 0:24:59.760
very much.
