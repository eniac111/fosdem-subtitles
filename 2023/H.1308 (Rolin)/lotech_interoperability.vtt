Hello everyone, I'm Saar Perakhtimish and I work for Collateral Productivity.

00:11.200 --> 00:20.360
This talk will be about any interoperability improvements in LibreOffice Impress Tables.

00:20.360 --> 00:26.040
So this is a screenshot from the bug report and let's talk about what was the problem

00:26.040 --> 00:30.520
on the surface level.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.960
On the right you can see how it appears in PowerPoint and on the left you can see how

00:35.960 --> 00:43.720
it appears when it was opened by Impress, the pptx file exported by PowerPoint.

00:43.720 --> 00:51.440
What we need to focus here is the rows pointed by the arrow are somehow shrunk when it was

00:51.440 --> 00:56.580
opened in Impress and it wasn't immediately obvious.

00:56.580 --> 01:05.040
If we look at how PowerPoint exports the table layout into pptx files, what we will realize

01:05.040 --> 01:12.120
is it defines row heights.

01:12.120 --> 01:18.360
So let's just focus on that part but it doesn't really define a total table height to fit

01:18.360 --> 01:28.120
inside and while we are importing this row heights what we do is we first calculate what

01:28.120 --> 01:34.920
does all of the rows, row heights add up to because we use the total table height to layout

01:34.920 --> 01:36.240
the table.

01:36.240 --> 01:42.920
So we calculate that by adding up each of the row heights and also we assign each row

01:42.920 --> 01:45.320
with their own heights.

01:45.320 --> 01:52.160
But turns out when this specific file is exported and if you look at row heights for the empty

01:52.160 --> 01:57.040
rows they are correct, there is nothing wrong there but if you look at for instance the

01:57.040 --> 02:04.320
one row that says cola it appears to have a row height of zero which doesn't really

02:04.320 --> 02:07.400
make sense.

02:07.400 --> 02:18.120
So now let's also something to mention here is if we start typing anything in one of the

02:18.120 --> 02:25.020
empty rows there are no text properties actually imported from the pptx file they are somehow

02:25.020 --> 02:30.760
lost in the process like the text when we start typing in the empty rows in the PowerPoint

02:30.760 --> 02:39.680
one starts as a blue it has a blue color etc it has a different size but if we write it

02:39.680 --> 02:45.880
in the impressed one it has just defaulted so it's black and 18 points.

02:45.880 --> 02:51.880
So before understanding the problem we need to know a little bit about how impressed layouts

02:51.880 --> 03:02.520
the table is basically fitted into a given total height but while doing so we also care

03:02.520 --> 03:10.920
for what were the each row heights were so basically we need to know the total height

03:10.920 --> 03:20.080
correctly because if it is smaller than some of the rows we basically happen to be shrinking

03:20.080 --> 03:26.320
trying to shrink the table when that happens what the impressed tries to do is adjust the

03:26.320 --> 03:33.200
row heights proportionally to what were they before and if there is text inside there is

03:33.200 --> 03:43.200
a minimum height it can go to and when that happens it like in this case when that happens

03:43.200 --> 03:50.720
since it can't shrink the line that says color further it shrinks the empty line because

03:50.720 --> 03:59.280
it can to try to fit in that to the wrong table height also if you explore the pptx

03:59.280 --> 04:05.200
output we will realize that the empty cell properties are exported in and paragraph run

04:05.200 --> 04:12.560
properties we need to import that there is an already an implementation for that but

04:12.560 --> 04:18.320
I'll discuss this a little bit later if you look at the problem in detail let's say what

04:18.320 --> 04:25.440
we need to fix here is we need to somehow care for this problematic row heights that

04:25.440 --> 04:34.800
during import which they don't have a height of zero but they are defined as so such and

04:34.800 --> 04:41.040
empty cell we need to know the text sizes for empty cells too we need to do this from

04:41.040 --> 04:45.440
n paragraph run properties also there was some previous range of pixels here that's

04:46.000 --> 04:51.120
kind of altered the layout in code instead of the import code and there are some regressions that

04:51.920 --> 05:00.480
messed up some table resizing functionality there we need to revert those changes and

05:02.560 --> 05:09.680
so basically it turns out to be parboin tries to export desired row heights for instance if you

05:09.680 --> 05:17.200
try to just pull arrow to zero while it has text in it it doesn't let you but it actually

05:17.200 --> 05:27.600
saves it as such so in the end that creates a problem for us so to fix this what we can do

05:27.600 --> 05:36.880
and what what I did was during the import before layouting the table into an area which how

05:36.880 --> 05:44.800
impress usually does it we do a pre-layouting which is we just take the row sizes and we don't

05:44.800 --> 05:51.520
give the layout in code any area to layout into and we let it layout itself so it basically

05:53.280 --> 06:00.720
just looks at the row sizes and tries to expand them if they are smaller than possible and

06:00.720 --> 06:12.000
then that gives us a final height that we can use to in successive layouting attempts so

06:12.000 --> 06:18.880
we kind of correct the total lay table heights doing that and

06:18.880 --> 06:30.080
then we also don't have the text properties for the empty rows so the problem there was

06:31.600 --> 06:39.680
and turns out these text properties are actually imported into text nodes but

06:40.720 --> 06:46.880
when there's new text is being typed they they actually inherit their properties from the

06:46.880 --> 06:54.320
cells owns properties instead of the text nodes text nodes are just being dumped and any ones

06:54.320 --> 07:02.960
are being created so to fix that we need to push the text properties from the n-paragraph

07:02.960 --> 07:10.800
run properties into the SAS properties that themselves to make it work correctly

07:10.800 --> 07:22.240
well to finish up with these fixes we were able to get rid of the problematic regression

07:22.240 --> 07:29.920
causing code in the layout thing and we moved the conceptual fixes from there into the import code

07:30.720 --> 07:38.320
making it possible to work correctly and additionally some unit tests were added to

07:38.320 --> 07:46.880
make sure the n-paragraph run properties stayed correctly that covered those areas

07:46.880 --> 08:10.000
thank you that's all from me
