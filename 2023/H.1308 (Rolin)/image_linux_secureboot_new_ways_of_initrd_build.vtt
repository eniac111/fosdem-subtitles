WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.800
Please sit down if you can.

00:11.800 --> 00:21.400
So the next speaker is speaking of Yandere Smek and he will talk about MK OSI INIT ADI,

00:21.400 --> 00:27.640
a new project to build INIT ADIs from system packages.

00:27.640 --> 00:33.480
Yeah, so my talk builds on previous talks.

00:33.480 --> 00:42.040
So my name is Bishak, I work in Red Hat in the Plumbers group and I work on System B and

00:42.040 --> 00:51.920
Fedora, Rust2RPM, RPM, Autospec, build tools and stuff like that.

00:51.920 --> 01:04.920
And so we heard today about a new approach to delivering the kernel and the user space,

01:04.920 --> 01:09.040
the root file system to computers.

01:09.040 --> 01:19.240
And I mean all the stuff that was mentioned today, so secure boot to trust your code,

01:19.240 --> 01:28.560
PCR measurements, boot phases, locking secrets to the PCR state.

01:28.560 --> 01:37.960
This creates a situation where we should think how we put, how we build INIT ADIs and I think

01:37.960 --> 01:49.120
it's a good opportunity to kind of throw away a lot of old approaches and use a new approach.

01:49.120 --> 01:58.640
And doing the things the way that I'm talking about today would have been very hard a few

01:58.640 --> 02:06.160
years ago because we didn't have those mechanisms that we have right now, like credentials and

02:06.160 --> 02:08.360
system extensions.

02:08.360 --> 02:21.960
So right, Luca talked about system extensions, so the compact disk images that carry a file

02:21.960 --> 02:30.760
system and one partition, the inverted data in another partition and a signature for the

02:30.760 --> 02:39.320
root hash of the de-inverted data in a third partition and this is squished into an image

02:39.320 --> 02:48.520
with minimal padding, so actually it sounds kind of awful but it's basically just a file

02:48.520 --> 02:53.840
system image with some metadata that can be trusted.

02:53.840 --> 03:03.320
And those tools allow us to do things in a completely different fashion than we used

03:03.320 --> 03:05.720
to do them in the past.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.240
So what do we do now?

03:07.240 --> 03:12.680
I mean, there's various different distributions but the approach is generally that on a general

03:12.680 --> 03:20.040
purpose distribution like Fedora, the user wants to have an INIT AD so they scrape some

03:20.040 --> 03:25.600
files of the file system, whatever is installed, sometimes with some local modifications, sometimes

03:25.600 --> 03:33.040
not, you use LDD to figure out what libraries should be loaded and whenever there are extra

03:33.040 --> 03:38.320
files that need to be put in the INIT ID, somebody has to remember to do that.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.600
So essentially we duplicate the packaging layer.

03:43.600 --> 03:50.480
And we do it on every user machine so this costs time during upgrades, it's actually

03:50.480 --> 03:55.560
quite noticeable because of compression.

03:55.560 --> 04:03.280
And so this was before we booted and after we have booted into the INIT ID, generally,

04:03.280 --> 04:08.120
for example, the Fedora INIT ID, they have system D but they also have lots of extra

04:08.120 --> 04:12.920
functionality added that came before system D was there.

04:12.920 --> 04:19.960
And over time, this functionality has been moving into system D. And now we are at the

04:19.960 --> 04:21.520
point where it's completely useless.

04:21.520 --> 04:27.680
I mean, the part that is apart from system D is not useful because we could just get

04:27.680 --> 04:35.920
rid of it and because it is implemented by system D in a better way in general.

04:35.920 --> 04:45.600
And people here, okay, now we should do something, access a file system in the INIT ID, let's

04:45.600 --> 04:47.640
like some patch to do it.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.640
And why?

04:48.640 --> 04:53.400
I mean, we should just do the same thing we do in the host file system and use proper

04:53.400 --> 04:54.440
tools.

04:54.440 --> 04:59.440
And if those tools are not good enough, then we should fix them so that it's nice to use

04:59.440 --> 05:05.560
them in the host file system and they're also nicer to use in the INIT ID.

05:05.560 --> 05:13.080
And it's like a legacy that this INIT ID environment used to be much different.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.800
But we use system D and system D does the setup where it sets up slash proc and slash

05:17.800 --> 05:23.320
dev and mounts everything that needs to be mounted.

05:23.320 --> 05:29.680
And the INIT ID doesn't have to be.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.440
The fact that it's different from a real system is just something that we should get rid of.

05:35.440 --> 05:41.240
And so we have this duplication where we have the system D way to do things and the non-system

05:41.240 --> 05:43.680
D way to do things in parallel.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.680
It just adds complexity and it's not beneficial.

05:48.680 --> 05:57.680
And everybody does the INIT ID in a very, very different way, every distribution.

05:57.680 --> 06:02.360
And even some distributions have multiple ways.

06:02.360 --> 06:08.000
I know that one of the goals of Trapwood was to unify the approach between distributions

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
that didn't really work.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.680
So this is another approach we'll see in 10 years.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.080
So we sign stuff.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.080
If we sign the kernel but not the INIT ID, then we are just pretending.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.880
It's a waste of time.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.040
We need to sign both.

06:27.040 --> 06:35.320
But in general, users want to have the thing, users don't want to play with local key management.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.600
It should be signed by the distro.

06:36.600 --> 06:41.560
If it's signed by the distro, then the INIT ID must be also built by the distro.

06:41.560 --> 06:47.480
So all this functionality that we have to inject things into the ID based on local configuration,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.840
well we cannot use it.

06:50.840 --> 06:56.160
So essentially the idea is that, OK, if we are going to move the whole build of the INIT

06:56.160 --> 07:01.520
ID into the distro infrastructure and build it like a package, then let's do it in a clean

07:01.520 --> 07:04.360
way.

07:04.360 --> 07:11.320
And for me, this means taking a declarative set of distribution package names, letting

07:11.320 --> 07:17.200
the distribution package manager figure out all the dependencies, and then using the distribution

07:17.200 --> 07:26.000
package manager to put the files in a directory, and then just zipping it up into any INIT

07:26.000 --> 07:29.480
ID.

07:29.480 --> 07:40.960
So before I talk about the specifics of how to do this, let's talk about some problems

07:40.960 --> 07:45.000
that immediately appear.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.400
If we try to build one INIT ID for, let's say, whole Fedora, then we will end up with

07:50.400 --> 07:58.960
this gigantic blob that will take 60 seconds to load whenever the kernel boots.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.760
This is not nice.

08:00.760 --> 08:07.000
So we need different INIT IDs for different people.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.640
And one option is to just build multiple variants, and we definitely plan to do this.

08:13.640 --> 08:19.720
For example, a simplified INIT ID that works for VMs that only has some basic stuff that

08:19.720 --> 08:27.840
you need in the VM and no other drivers and no other tools, and I know one for laptops

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
and so on.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.320
But this only scales so far.

08:30.320 --> 08:35.560
We can have maybe five variants, but anything more than that would be annoying.

08:35.560 --> 08:41.400
And the other approach is to use systemd extensions.

08:41.400 --> 08:49.320
So the idea would be that you have the basic INIT ID, and let's say you want, I don't know,

08:49.320 --> 08:55.880
it's in your INIT ID, and you install this additional extension.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.120
And I should mention what happens with trust here.

09:00.120 --> 09:10.040
So the bootloader verifies the kernel and the INIT ID before loading it.

09:10.040 --> 09:19.000
And then after the INIT ID has been loaded, and we want to use the INIT ID code loads

09:19.000 --> 09:24.480
the extension, so it checks the signature of the extension before loading it.

09:24.480 --> 09:31.480
So systemd extensions are a mechanism to add code in a way that it is trusted before, I

09:31.480 --> 09:36.800
mean the trust is checked before it is used.

09:36.800 --> 09:46.920
And if we use UKIs, we need some way to inject configuration into the...

09:46.920 --> 09:53.560
Well, I mean we build an image that's supposed to work everywhere, so it cannot have local

09:53.560 --> 09:58.080
configuration, and we need to deal with this issue somehow.

09:58.080 --> 10:03.600
And one approach is to use the just auto discovery of partitions and not have any local configuration,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.480
which is nice if we can make it work.

10:07.480 --> 10:17.280
But a more general approach is to use credentials and to inject a configuration that has been

10:17.280 --> 10:22.640
signed and bound somehow to the local system using systemd credentials.

10:22.640 --> 10:27.520
And I would say that this is an area of active research, because I don't think that anybody

10:27.520 --> 10:33.240
really knows how this is supposed to work in details.

10:33.240 --> 10:44.400
And I wanted to mention that if we build INIT IDs from packages, we have builder reproducibility,

10:44.400 --> 10:49.520
because we have an exact list of packages that was used, and we can download them again

10:49.520 --> 11:01.160
and unpack them again in the same way, and we should have bit for bit identical result,

11:01.160 --> 11:06.440
which is good for checking that the EID was put together correctly, but it's also very

11:06.440 --> 11:11.480
useful if you want to build some system extension afterwards, because you build the extension

11:11.480 --> 11:18.480
by adding additional stuff and then taking the difference between the old image and the

11:18.480 --> 11:20.800
new image.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.160
And the tool that we are using for this is...

11:25.160 --> 11:34.480
Well, the project is called mqsi-interd, because it takes mqsi, which is a very simple tool

11:34.480 --> 11:45.280
that takes a list of packages and calls the package manager to download the packages and

11:45.280 --> 11:47.240
put them into an image.

11:47.240 --> 11:58.840
And it does all the things that we happen to need, so it supports GPT tables and the

11:58.840 --> 12:04.200
mvarity and signatures, so we can do system extensions, and it can also do archives, and

12:04.200 --> 12:08.840
this is what you need for INIT RAMFS format.

12:08.840 --> 12:19.720
And mqsi itself is just a set of configuration scripts for configuration files for mqsi,

12:19.720 --> 12:25.440
right now only for Fedora, but the concept carries very cleanly into other distributions,

12:25.440 --> 12:30.760
so I think that if it works in Fedora, maybe other people will pick it up too.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.080
So just a list of packages and some local...

12:35.080 --> 12:46.080
Some tweaks to turn the installed packages into an INITRD, and the same for system extensions.

12:46.080 --> 12:51.600
And well, in general, the plan is to do it on the distro side, but right now this hasn't

12:51.600 --> 12:56.320
happened yet, so we have a kernel install plugin, and you update the kernel and you

12:56.320 --> 13:00.120
very slowly build the INITRD from packages on the local system.

13:00.120 --> 13:06.480
It's not very efficient, but it works surprisingly stably.

13:06.480 --> 13:14.440
And for Fedora 39, we want to propose changes to the build system to allow INITRD to be

13:14.440 --> 13:19.400
built in this way in the build system and deliver those packages for people who want

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
to try it out.

13:20.400 --> 13:26.520
I think it's years from being the default, if ever.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.480
So, this works.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.680
It works without too much issue.

13:34.680 --> 13:42.520
The INITRDs are bigger, but they're not infinitely bigger, they're maybe just twice as big.

13:42.520 --> 13:49.640
And the biggest difference surprisingly comes from kernel modules, because what Drakut and

13:49.640 --> 13:56.000
other INITRD builders do, they select a specific list of kernel modules that are needed for

13:56.000 --> 13:59.720
the local system.

13:59.720 --> 14:05.000
I wanted to avoid this, I wanted to take all the modules from a kernel package and just

14:05.000 --> 14:11.080
put them in without knowledge about specific modules.

14:11.080 --> 14:17.920
I think that this is not feasible, we'll have to do some kind of filtering too.

14:17.920 --> 14:28.880
But the code itself, there's very little difference in the size of executables and libraries

14:28.880 --> 14:30.720
installed into the INITRD.

14:30.720 --> 14:38.000
And this is because the code that we use in the INITRD is the same code from the host

14:38.000 --> 14:44.560
file system, so it has the same library dependencies and you need to put the same set of libraries,

14:44.560 --> 14:48.960
and actually most of the space is taken by libraries, because the functionality has been

14:48.960 --> 14:55.960
moving more and more into shared libraries because we build more complicated stacks.

14:55.960 --> 15:04.680
So this means that in principle the size overhead is not too big and can be reduced.

15:04.680 --> 15:11.760
And this works in some cases, but for simple cases, for laptops and for some types of storage,

15:11.760 --> 15:16.080
not certainly not for everything.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.120
And what do we get?

15:18.120 --> 15:23.880
We have less things, we use the package dependency resolution mechanism so we don't duplicate

15:23.880 --> 15:31.240
packaging, we don't need to care about installation because we have RPM to do it for us or whatever.

15:31.240 --> 15:37.560
We have replaceable builds because we don't take files from the host and everybody has

15:37.560 --> 15:44.840
the same image which is important for people trying to debug errors reported by users.

15:44.840 --> 15:50.920
And if we build things centrally, we can assign them, and we use system D and just get rid

15:50.920 --> 15:55.000
of the extra stuff so our life is simpler.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.040
And there's a common set of things that people complain about, like arrays when this is discussed.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.820
So I wanted to underline that system D is already used in the INITRD so we're just removing

16:06.820 --> 16:08.800
things, not adding new things.

16:08.800 --> 16:16.800
And system D sets up the environment so things are already like they should be.

16:16.800 --> 16:22.160
So all the extra work that people have put into having scripts that work without slash

16:22.160 --> 16:26.440
prop mounted, it's not useful.

16:26.440 --> 16:34.280
And we remove stuff and we would be moving from scripts to demands anyway, right?

16:34.280 --> 16:45.320
And shared libraries because if somebody tells you to provide to authentication, for the

16:45.320 --> 16:48.720
root disk, you're not going to script it, you're going to use some compiled code to

16:48.720 --> 16:50.720
do it anyway.

16:50.720 --> 16:59.840
And I don't know, netling, timeout, retries, localization, D bus, all this stuff is just

16:59.840 --> 17:01.960
semi incompatible with scripting.

17:01.960 --> 17:08.160
And we would be moving in the direction of normal compiled code anyway.

17:08.160 --> 17:21.360
And so in case the ID itself is kind of, it's implemented and mostly works.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.080
The stuff that is happening is in the surrounding areas.

17:24.080 --> 17:32.200
So in particular, this development in system D related to credentials is very important

17:32.200 --> 17:36.640
because we want to make use of this.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.000
And support for unified kernel images is growing.

17:40.000 --> 17:52.300
There are patches, there's a link here, patches for grab two to load unified kernel images.

17:52.300 --> 17:58.880
And I mentioned that we want to build MKSI interior images in Fedora, so this will require

17:58.880 --> 18:02.640
changes in the code you build system.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.560
And that's what I have.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.920
I have to have time for questions.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.000
One minute, three minutes.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Okay.

18:13.000 --> 18:20.520
When I was thinking about systems that boot from network and for instance, where the root

18:20.520 --> 18:27.960
system is on ISKASE or NVM over fiber, you need some information that is really device

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
specific.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.760
How can we separate that from the init ID?

18:31.760 --> 18:37.840
Because you want a single init ID for all the systems.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.840
Yes.

18:38.840 --> 18:44.800
So one option is to put it on the kernel command line if this is an option.

18:44.800 --> 18:53.600
And the second option is to provide a credential that is unpacked and becomes part of the configuration

18:53.600 --> 18:57.760
in the init ID.

18:57.760 --> 19:03.880
So essentially, yes, you just inject this configuration, but it wouldn't be part of

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
the init ID itself.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.600
It would be delivered in a different way.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
Same questions.

19:10.600 --> 19:15.480
What would you do if you want to have files from the local file system?

19:15.480 --> 19:20.680
For example, you need a custom mount command that does more than a feature mount.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.640
Well, I would say ask why do you need that?

19:24.640 --> 19:28.360
But if you need that, then just do the build locally.

19:28.360 --> 19:36.440
And the difference is, I think it was kind of the same question as before about unified

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
kernel images.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
You can do the build locally.

19:38.440 --> 19:49.760
You just don't have the distro signatures.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
Thank you.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.160
It might be a bit similar to the previous question, but thinking from a distribution

19:55.160 --> 20:00.840
standpoint, there is a lot of hardware out there which is incompatible with default configurations

20:00.840 --> 20:02.720
or default init urges.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.960
And you need to add patches to kernels.

20:04.960 --> 20:09.400
You need to add special kernel modules which are not enabled by default.

20:09.400 --> 20:17.160
What is going to be the flow to support this hardware to use it on distribution by default?

20:17.160 --> 20:22.920
So I think that this is much less common than people think, right?

20:22.920 --> 20:28.520
Because I mean, how many people build their kernels nowadays?

20:28.520 --> 20:29.880
Small minority.

20:29.880 --> 20:36.520
And from the distro point of view, this is already outside of scope, right?

20:36.520 --> 20:41.920
If you report a bug that your custom compiled kernel does not work, then nobody is going

20:41.920 --> 20:50.480
to help you because people have too much bugs reported for the standard distribution.

20:50.480 --> 20:56.000
The existing ways of building things locally, they will always be there, right?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.360
I mean, they are not going away.

20:57.360 --> 21:02.440
So basically the answer is, well, I mean, if you are doing something specific, then

21:02.440 --> 21:03.920
you keep doing this specific thing.

21:03.920 --> 21:11.240
And this is the way to make the life for the distro easier, but it's not going to cover

21:11.240 --> 21:16.560
all cases, maybe like 90%.

21:16.560 --> 21:27.160
Any more questions?

21:27.160 --> 21:31.240
You mentioned kernel model making the entire bigger.

21:31.240 --> 21:35.640
Could this be shipped in a standard extension somehow?

21:35.640 --> 21:36.720
Can you repeat?

21:36.720 --> 21:43.320
Could you ship the kernel models which are in the internet in system extension instead?

21:43.320 --> 21:51.400
So the kernel and the initial internet, the kernel must have enough stuff built into to

21:51.400 --> 21:58.400
understand the int rd and the int rd must have enough modules to be able to load system

21:58.400 --> 21:59.640
extensions.

21:59.640 --> 22:08.120
But once you do that, like you can have an extension with kernel modules and whatever.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.680
Yes.

22:10.680 --> 22:17.240
So last question.

22:17.240 --> 22:24.680
Is there a path to getting your int ramfs core from somewhere and running a different

22:24.680 --> 22:25.680
distro?

22:25.680 --> 22:32.280
Like essentially to your project or some project providing the core int ramfs with the system

22:32.280 --> 22:35.400
D inside it and everything inside of it.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.680
Get the modules from elsewhere.

22:36.680 --> 22:40.680
And then when you pivot, is that a hard line that you can live?

22:40.680 --> 22:49.240
I think that technically it's doable because system D is kind of used everywhere and there's

22:49.240 --> 22:51.280
really no reason why it wouldn't work.

22:51.280 --> 23:01.400
I assume that distro would want their own code in the int rd, but technically it's not

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
required.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.120
Okay, thank you.

23:04.120 --> 23:10.560
I mean, if there's this general requirement that because there's a switch route where

23:10.560 --> 23:16.800
the state is passed from the int rd to the host and you don't want to pass the state

23:16.800 --> 23:24.200
from a newer system D to an older system D. So the int rd would have to be just older,

23:24.200 --> 23:30.520
old enough.

23:30.520 --> 23:37.520
Thank you very much.
