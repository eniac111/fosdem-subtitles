00:00.000 --> 00:13.120
Okay, the next one is me. So somebody else has to watch the time and drag me off the

00:13.120 --> 00:24.280
stage. Welcome to a bit of an update on LibreOffice accessibility, in this particular case, PDF

00:24.280 --> 00:31.800
accessibility. My name is Thorsten. We're running our own company here, Consultancy,

00:31.800 --> 00:39.320
and some products around LibreOffice. This work here has been funded by a customer, so

00:39.320 --> 00:46.600
it's always great to have people paying for improvements in LibreOffice. I'm very grateful

00:46.600 --> 00:50.720
for that. That's why we can present this today.

00:50.720 --> 00:59.240
Quickly, there is a difference between document and application accessibility. So accessibility

00:59.240 --> 01:07.920
can be many, many things from the Wikipedia, makes products, devices, services usable by

01:07.920 --> 01:13.000
people with disabilities. And of course, the main thing that needs to be accessible with

01:13.000 --> 01:19.280
LibreOffice is the software itself. And there's been a lot of work ongoing over many years

01:19.280 --> 01:25.480
there, but also what LibreOffice produces, the documents, also need to be accessible.

01:25.480 --> 01:33.480
So that's more on the services side of the products, the outcome there.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.680
Application accessibility, as I said, lots of work has been ongoing. There's been two

01:37.680 --> 01:45.160
tenders from the foundation. Both of them went to Hypera. And I think one of them, I

01:45.160 --> 01:50.880
think there's still a bit of work ongoing there. The first one definitely is finished.

01:50.880 --> 02:01.000
That resulted in some cleanups and some checks and also some build time checking that all

02:01.000 --> 02:11.400
the dialogues have all the prerequisites set so that the GUI remains is and remains accessible.

02:11.400 --> 02:17.960
And the second tender is for actually being able to, like, enabling to run and also not

02:17.960 --> 02:24.760
breaking it going forward with the platform accessibility APIs so that the screen readers

02:24.760 --> 02:32.440
and other tools actually work with LibreOffice and make that testable and lock that down.

02:32.440 --> 02:38.720
So that was some LibreOffice. And Jock's Corner advertising. So LibreOffice is looking

02:38.720 --> 02:47.040
for some accessibility engineer. There's a drop posting there. And if you're interested,

02:47.040 --> 02:55.760
apply about now. I think the deadline is sometime next week, I believe. Closing that. Or tell

02:55.760 --> 03:03.000
your friends and family. So document accessibility, that's what I'm focusing on. Relevant standards.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.960
And we're talking about PDF here. Some web content. Accessibility guidelines. That's

03:09.960 --> 03:16.280
about HTML mostly. But much of that also applies to other document types. And then there's

03:16.280 --> 03:22.800
the PDF UA, the PDF universal accessibility standard that mandates lots of things. Mostly

03:22.800 --> 03:28.940
meter data that is out of the document so that suitable tools like screen readers can

03:28.940 --> 03:35.040
extract that and say, okay, I need to read this, but I don't need to read that. Or for

03:35.040 --> 03:42.360
images that there's a description, like a textural description of what this image contains.

03:42.360 --> 03:49.120
There's a nice overview and an actionable list of checks that you can go through in

03:49.120 --> 03:56.300
the so-called Matterhorn protocol. Yes. And if you pass that checklist, then you can be

03:56.300 --> 04:01.200
pretty sure that your document is accessible. And there's validators for that. The pack

04:01.200 --> 04:08.080
one and the veri-pdf pack is closed source or source available or something if you ask.

04:08.080 --> 04:15.960
And veri-pdf is a proper open source. Okay. So what did we do? We fixed a lot of bugs.

04:15.960 --> 04:22.120
There are still some bugs left here. About 14 when I checked last. So anybody who's interested

04:22.120 --> 04:30.700
in having accessibility bugs fixed, give them a call. And that's what we did. So quite a

04:30.700 --> 04:39.480
chunk of things that still had to be fixed after so very many years at the, let's say,

04:39.480 --> 04:45.000
core level. Like actually getting metadata that was already there in the document down

04:45.000 --> 04:51.560
into the PDF in the correct way. So like getting the information down. That was the first thing.

04:51.560 --> 04:56.600
So that the PDF export could write it to disk and then also getting it in the proper way.

04:56.600 --> 05:03.560
So like at the right position in the metadata structure. Not forgetting something. Not mistyping

05:03.560 --> 05:13.000
some tags, et cetera. Yeah. And it's quite across the board what we did there. And I

05:13.000 --> 05:22.240
can say that for reasonably complex documents actually were passing now the accessibility

05:22.240 --> 05:32.280
checks like those validators. So that was actual bug fixing. And we also had to add

05:32.280 --> 05:40.760
a few features. The most important one is adding the stack-related flag for flies. So

05:40.760 --> 05:48.240
if you check the latest, I think we missed 7.4. I'm not sure. But in any case, a recent

05:48.240 --> 05:53.440
master. If you insert in writer, if you insert a text frame on the options page, you get

05:53.440 --> 06:01.360
a new check box that says decorate. So you can now say this content here is not important

06:01.360 --> 06:08.680
for the document. This is just some whatever coat of arms for your family. Or it's just

06:08.680 --> 06:13.720
a background picture or something that is not really important for the content. It's

06:13.720 --> 06:24.280
just decoration. And that was not saved. Also not saved in ODF. So that actually was a feature

06:24.280 --> 06:28.960
we had to be able to so users could say, okay, this is not important. That is not important.

06:28.960 --> 06:36.000
But this is. And then being able to save and reload that. And some UX improvements on the

06:36.000 --> 06:41.280
accessibility checker dialogue. Which was the work from Colabra. Good stuff there. Also

06:41.280 --> 06:48.600
the third one, the online accessibility checker. If you enable experimental features, then

06:48.600 --> 06:57.280
you get the extras menu. You get some automatic checking thing. Which is this one. Automatic

06:57.280 --> 07:04.400
accessibility checking. And if you do that, you get this kind of counter there. Like how

07:04.400 --> 07:14.840
many more accessibility bugs you still need to check or fix. So that part of the toolbar.

07:14.840 --> 07:24.340
And so we made the actual dialogue a little bit nicer to use. So in this case, not making

07:24.340 --> 07:29.240
it modal. Because if it's modal, you can't interact with the document. So you get a warning.

07:29.240 --> 07:35.760
Like in this case, no alt text for the image. So you want to kind of select the image and

07:35.760 --> 07:39.680
set the alt text. But for that, you need to close the dialogue. So if you have more than

07:39.680 --> 07:44.080
let's say ten things there, then you'll forget where you were. So it's much nicer if it's

07:44.080 --> 07:51.200
not modal. And yeah, and also have some rescan buttons. So it's kind of orthogonal to this

07:51.200 --> 07:59.400
automatic online check. Right. So that was that. As I said, in a decent shape now. Far

07:59.400 --> 08:06.680
from done. But it starts to be usable. Future plans is some user experience. So the goal

08:06.680 --> 08:13.680
should be to be in power with Word. So really not having users click four times every single

08:13.680 --> 08:20.160
image that they need to put an alt text in. Which is really annoying. And do something

08:20.160 --> 08:26.520
that is kind of smooth. That is like one click. Or even perhaps optionally something like

08:26.520 --> 08:34.800
AI supported auto image generation or something like that. Presumably. Or other great ideas.

08:34.800 --> 08:42.240
But I think what's really, so I think the basics, the let's say technology, the engine

08:42.240 --> 08:47.920
start, it's pretty okay. And the focus now should be on the usability. So making what's

08:47.920 --> 08:53.960
implemented actually usable. And I guess that's it. Thank you.
