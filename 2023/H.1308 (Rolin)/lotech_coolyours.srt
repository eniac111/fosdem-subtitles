0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:14.080
So, I'm Pedro, Pedro Silva, and today we are going to look at how we can make Collabora

2
0:00:14.080 --> 0:00:21.600
Online yours and how those customizations can actually lead into new features while

3
0:00:21.600 --> 0:00:24.080
going through some cool new features.

4
0:00:24.080 --> 0:00:25.480
Why not?

5
0:00:25.480 --> 0:00:34.920
So we start over with these different themes and different aspects that Collabora Online

6
0:00:34.920 --> 0:00:37.120
can have.

7
0:00:37.120 --> 0:00:42.520
But not only we can have these different faces, but we can also have different buttons.

8
0:00:42.520 --> 0:00:47.680
If you have a different button that you'd like to have, or maybe you are hacking on

9
0:00:47.680 --> 0:00:52.120
something and you want to have it in front of a button that triggers something, you can

10
0:00:52.120 --> 0:00:53.420
do that.

11
0:00:53.420 --> 0:01:02.880
And we'll show later how, but spoiler alert, we have an XML file that you can customize

12
0:01:02.880 --> 0:01:09.000
it, we have a post message API that you can actually use that to hack directly onto the

13
0:01:09.000 --> 0:01:11.440
interface and beyond.

14
0:01:11.440 --> 0:01:19.920
And third of all, we also have some kind of cool variables that go through some invisible

15
0:01:19.920 --> 0:01:22.840
input field that then customize it.

16
0:01:22.840 --> 0:01:28.080
So there is a lot of stuff that you can just hack around.

17
0:01:28.080 --> 0:01:33.520
And by the way, LanguageTool, as described by Michael Meeks, thanks to Athvinis, and

18
0:01:33.520 --> 0:01:41.440
we got this cool integration, file properties, another improved and now native functionality.

19
0:01:41.440 --> 0:01:44.560
You see here on this tab, there's plenty of space.

20
0:01:44.560 --> 0:01:46.360
You might want to add a button here.

21
0:01:46.360 --> 0:01:47.360
Why not?

22
0:01:47.360 --> 0:01:50.680
It's a good candidate to do that.

23
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:54.720
Our clients, accessibility check.

24
0:01:54.720 --> 0:02:03.720
We go through these new features, how we can create diagrams, and you will soon start to

25
0:02:03.720 --> 0:02:11.040
feel that, okay, this is fitting my workflow, but maybe I want to go a step further.

26
0:02:11.040 --> 0:02:13.720
By the way, we can even do this crazy stuff.

27
0:02:13.720 --> 0:02:14.720
Isn't it crazy?

28
0:02:14.720 --> 0:02:15.720
On the browser?

29
0:02:15.720 --> 0:02:16.720
I don't know.

30
0:02:16.720 --> 0:02:17.720
I think it's crazy.

31
0:02:17.720 --> 0:02:25.000
Oh, and while doing this, we got a lot of performance wins left and right, which is

32
0:02:25.000 --> 0:02:27.320
it's cool and all, but what about new features?

33
0:02:27.320 --> 0:02:30.400
What about upcoming features?

34
0:02:30.400 --> 0:02:39.600
We work with LibreOffice technology around in a group with friends, and this means not

35
0:02:39.600 --> 0:02:43.440
only the people that are here, but even other people.

36
0:02:43.440 --> 0:02:48.560
For instance, in this case, next cloud, and we are just doing something that can start

37
0:02:48.560 --> 0:02:54.240
with online, then forces us to go to the core to LibreOffice kit, and in the process we

38
0:02:54.240 --> 0:02:56.080
are improving both sides.

39
0:02:56.080 --> 0:02:58.240
That's interesting.

40
0:02:58.240 --> 0:03:08.200
For instance, this is an example with form controls, as Miklos described, content controls,

41
0:03:08.200 --> 0:03:10.160
right?

42
0:03:10.160 --> 0:03:12.280
Repair documents, some other improvements.

43
0:03:12.280 --> 0:03:15.280
How do we make it, how we customize it?

44
0:03:15.280 --> 0:03:16.280
That's the question.

45
0:03:16.280 --> 0:03:21.760
So, as I hinted before, we can do that via XML, and there is a lot of variables that

46
0:03:21.760 --> 0:03:24.680
you can just turn off.

47
0:03:24.680 --> 0:03:32.240
We even saw it earlier with Pranam's talk, one of those examples, but you can set what's

48
0:03:32.240 --> 0:03:35.160
going to be the default UI mode.

49
0:03:35.160 --> 0:03:42.040
If you want to go a little bit further, you can hack what will be those key colors that

50
0:03:42.040 --> 0:03:49.520
we can see, and you see here the input values that we can pass.

51
0:03:49.520 --> 0:03:52.240
Or why not hack it directly into it?

52
0:03:52.240 --> 0:03:57.640
Maybe you have a different, your native language is not English, and you might want to test

53
0:03:57.640 --> 0:03:59.120
it on that.

54
0:03:59.120 --> 0:04:06.080
Maybe you don't know, but you can add, at the end of your URL, you can add this end

55
0:04:06.080 --> 0:04:13.200
length and for instance, some different language directional layout, and you can test that

56
0:04:13.200 --> 0:04:16.440
and maybe even help us translate.

57
0:04:16.440 --> 0:04:17.440
Why not?

58
0:04:17.440 --> 0:04:20.480
You can just go to the web later and just start to contribute.

59
0:04:20.480 --> 0:04:28.040
You see, all those things, you are making that yours, because it's answering your problem,

60
0:04:28.040 --> 0:04:33.520
but at the same time, you are helping everyone else, so I think that's the key here.

61
0:04:33.520 --> 0:04:38.840
Or inserting a new custom button, for instance, insert button is just one of the options that

62
0:04:38.840 --> 0:04:43.400
you can use and abuse with PostMessage API.

63
0:04:43.400 --> 0:04:50.640
So if you go to stk.collaboronline.com, slash docs, slash PostMessage API, you will see all

64
0:04:50.640 --> 0:04:58.280
these listed in a table with examples, so you can just hack it.

65
0:04:58.280 --> 0:05:00.400
Have fun with it.

66
0:05:00.400 --> 0:05:05.720
Even if it doesn't work out of the box, even if you are trying to hack something and it

67
0:05:05.720 --> 0:05:07.440
breaks, it's okay.

68
0:05:07.440 --> 0:05:08.920
You can always keep in touch.

69
0:05:08.920 --> 0:05:18.480
You can go to cola slash io, and there is our IRC, our matrix telegram, all these things.

70
0:05:18.480 --> 0:05:26.320
You can report bugs and maybe push a PR, and you will find out that maybe your PR will

71
0:05:26.320 --> 0:05:32.040
leave to learn more about LibreOffice technology, LibreOffice kit, and suddenly you already

72
0:05:32.040 --> 0:05:37.520
have two PRs, both on cola.collaboronline and on Garrett on LibreOffice.

73
0:05:37.520 --> 0:05:42.400
So hopefully it's what will happen.

74
0:05:42.400 --> 0:05:46.200
And while doing that, you have three minutes questions, yes?

75
0:05:46.200 --> 0:05:51.760
And while you are doing that, you will be able to experiment to crazy new features,

76
0:05:51.760 --> 0:05:55.800
the bleeding edge, that still no one knows about it, because you build it.

77
0:05:55.800 --> 0:06:01.160
So maybe you can already see what is happening there, what's the new features, new integration

78
0:06:01.160 --> 0:06:06.920
that's coming, hit on citations, but many more things.

79
0:06:06.920 --> 0:06:15.000
So I hope you take that at heart and give it a go, and join the team.

80
0:06:15.000 --> 0:06:17.000
Thanks.

81
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:26.200
Any questions?

82
0:06:26.200 --> 0:06:32.600
We've got some two and a half minutes.

83
0:06:32.600 --> 0:06:33.600
Thank you.

84
0:06:33.600 --> 0:06:34.600
Thank you.

85
0:06:34.600 --> 0:06:37.280
I use cola on my next cloud.

86
0:06:37.280 --> 0:06:40.080
Can I do all this on my next cloud?

87
0:06:40.080 --> 0:06:41.080
Yes.

88
0:06:41.080 --> 0:06:42.080
Is it?

89
0:06:42.080 --> 0:06:49.760
Yes, if you have your built environment, you can hack all these things and have it.

90
0:06:49.760 --> 0:06:53.920
Now if you have a production environment, that's probably what you are hitting at,

91
0:06:53.920 --> 0:06:59.360
okay, then you can still do some of these customizations just by simply hacking on the

92
0:06:59.360 --> 0:07:08.960
coolwst.xml, that it should be under ATC directory, and you should find there, coolwst.xml.

93
0:07:08.960 --> 0:07:12.880
You can, for instance, set up the default UI, what will be the default UI that will

94
0:07:12.880 --> 0:07:18.720
appear if you want to use the integrator's theme or not, for instance, if you are using

95
0:07:18.720 --> 0:07:24.760
next cloud, next cloud has its own theme, so you can hack all these things.

96
0:07:24.760 --> 0:07:27.760
What's the default language?

97
0:07:27.760 --> 0:07:31.680
Maybe you have three or four languages there as a list, and maybe you don't need.

98
0:07:31.680 --> 0:07:36.160
Maybe you just use maybe two, Portuguese or English, and both, two, and you can remove

99
0:07:36.160 --> 0:07:39.360
the others and it will maybe use less resources.

100
0:07:39.360 --> 0:07:41.760
So there is a lot of things you can hack.

101
0:07:41.760 --> 0:07:43.760
Will do, thank you.

102
0:07:43.760 --> 0:07:48.440
30 seconds, one very quick question and answer.

103
0:07:48.440 --> 0:07:52.280
If not, go for the matrix chat.

104
0:07:52.280 --> 0:07:53.280
Thank you.

105
0:07:53.280 --> 0:08:19.800
Thank you.
