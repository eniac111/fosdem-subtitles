WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.960
I guess I start already because otherwise it gets boring.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.640
Hi everyone, I'm Zvante Schubert.

00:12.640 --> 00:20.080
I started in 1999 with StarOffice in Hamburg and never worked on LibreOffice, Core, StarOffice

00:20.080 --> 00:21.160
earlier.

00:21.160 --> 00:27.520
But always from the beginning, I although applied at C++, are the Java-based Webtop,

00:27.520 --> 00:30.400
we called it, a WebOffice, right?

00:30.400 --> 00:31.840
And we had two in some.

00:31.840 --> 00:35.760
The second one was where the Golden Master came in 2011.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.640
It was canceled, everything.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.760
And this library I'm talking about, the ODF Toolkit, was the core of this WebOffice and

00:43.760 --> 00:48.980
later on a fork from OpenExchange for another WebOffice.

00:48.980 --> 00:56.640
So I worked once at the ODF standard, which is the FIFR mod, the shock-frozen runtime

00:56.640 --> 00:58.720
that you dump and send to others.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.680
And the reason of the standard is to be interoperable with other things like Microsoft Office.

01:03.680 --> 01:09.440
Microsoft is also participating in the OASIS ODFTC.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.440
Okay.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.640
So far, not bringing your own laptop because everything goes faster this way.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.680
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.740
So by the way, we are three from seven members in the OASIS TC.

01:23.740 --> 01:28.800
We are three from the Buckman Foundation, Rigina Henschel, who is very active, and Michael

01:28.800 --> 01:31.680
Stauff from Atropia, many thanks for Atropia joining that.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.320
And Michael is also the co-maintainer of this ODF Toolkit.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.320
And yes, sorry.

01:40.320 --> 01:46.400
Dennis, bring my back, please.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
Okay.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.000
So yes, yes, yes.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.720
So, the ODF Toolkit is basically Java-based and it has two main core deliverables.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.240
This is the ODF DOM.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.640
And the other thing is the validator.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.040
And yes, I know, but gosh, here we go.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.840
Sorry for the inconvenience.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.840
It's over there.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.840
Gosh.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.840
Oh.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.840
Gosh.

02:26.840 --> 02:42.840
Hey, here's something.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.840
Okay.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
Sorry.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
Okay.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.080
The one thing is the core of the ODF DOM.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.160
And the online validator is the wrapper around it.

02:53.160 --> 02:58.320
And you know it's host of ODF and it's used for validating this ODF file format.

02:58.320 --> 03:03.760
And ODF DOM, you hear it by the name, it's not only an ODF implementation, but also

03:03.760 --> 03:04.920
in DOM.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.200
And you might know this from the browsers.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.400
And that's the browser standard, the HTML standard, the demand that at the runtime,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.960
the browser is accessible by the DOM API.

03:13.960 --> 03:21.600
And that is the way that JavaScript not only runs in Firefox, but that is this macros are

03:21.600 --> 03:23.480
inter-bubble in all browsers.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.120
And ODF doesn't have such runtime API.

03:26.120 --> 03:31.760
You have either a libroface macro or a Microsoft often macro and they do not work to each other.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.440
This is a real downtime.

03:33.440 --> 03:38.320
I don't say that we need a DOM, but there's no DOM access at libroface.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.280
But it would be nice to have a feature API, a high-level API.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.240
And the reason is that we have a standard, a blueprint, the OSTC-given standard, and

03:47.240 --> 03:51.560
then we have this implementation where ODF has one of them and it's hosted by ODF.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.880
And just in a nutshell, what is the standard defining?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.600
The standard blueprint is defining the zip.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.560
If you have an ODT document, you can exchange the suffix and then you suddenly have a zip.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.840
And there's parts in the specification parts, number one introduction, number four formula

04:08.840 --> 04:10.520
that's not implemented here.

04:10.520 --> 04:16.200
But the zip itself is defined in the package like the encryption signature and also this

04:16.200 --> 04:21.480
meta-inf manifest which is a content table and you find the signature XML as well.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.400
And the whole XML part is one of them.

04:23.400 --> 04:31.000
And the reason now, the high-level goal is to have to close the gap between the standard,

04:31.000 --> 04:32.960
the blueprint and the implementation.

04:32.960 --> 04:37.160
Like want to get away from paper because you don't want to get, oh, here, developer, here's

04:37.160 --> 04:40.280
another 500 pages of specification, I'll start.

04:40.280 --> 04:46.480
But the idea is to generate as much as possible like documentation and most of the core by

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
this.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.320
And yes, ease by this development.

04:50.320 --> 04:56.840
And how it's been done because we are generating from the XML, look, there are a lot of elements

04:56.840 --> 05:00.640
of XML, but the manifest is like a set of content table signatures, also the manifest

05:00.640 --> 05:06.720
XML and all of these is taken away abstracted from the developers.

05:06.720 --> 05:13.480
So we generate the DOM tree and type DOM tree like for each element and attribute.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.740
We have a class and element gives you methods to what's inserted.

05:18.740 --> 05:21.360
And the default values are extracted from the spec.

05:21.360 --> 05:28.360
So soonish is like you should have a constructor from all the mandatory words of the sub tree

05:28.360 --> 05:29.720
or something like this.

05:29.720 --> 05:37.680
But there's also some gap in the digital gap in the spec, like there's some formulas in

05:37.680 --> 05:45.200
the floating text saying, oh, when attribute A is active, then the attribute B, sorry,

05:45.200 --> 05:49.320
if it's B is present, then A become active or there's a certain value for B. And these

05:49.320 --> 05:54.120
conditions I would love to read out and generate from it the source code because I don't want

05:54.120 --> 05:57.880
to type it myself with thousands of attributes.

05:57.880 --> 06:02.440
Another thing that's not there because it's a lot of things, the puzzle pieces, I would

06:02.440 --> 06:04.640
call them feature.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.640
And this should be the feature API.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.360
Everybody expects there's an image and there's a table.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.600
And this is like even if you don't know anything about ODF, you will find another platform

06:14.600 --> 06:20.240
that's HTML markdown and you have a certain assumption that if there's a table, you can

06:20.240 --> 06:21.240
insert a column.

06:21.240 --> 06:28.760
So this insert column function, yes, this change API request that has a certain pattern

06:28.760 --> 06:29.760
of XML change.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.640
And this might and should be defined and spec generate even this API from it.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.160
So in the end, it's something like this.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.800
We have a semantic layer, this is currently not generatable, an XML layer and a package

06:40.800 --> 06:49.120
layer and the idea is that you might exchange the semantic layer with even other platform

06:49.120 --> 06:54.000
elements like there's also a table where you can do a table insert column and markdown

06:54.000 --> 06:55.040
this way.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.040
So let me run through it a bit.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.920
Of course, there's just a model and not a view.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.960
This is for Libre of us only and because as well that the spec is not very strict on the

07:03.960 --> 07:05.120
view.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.160
And the highlights is we've done recently a release for ODF1 or O2 still.

07:10.160 --> 07:15.720
We refactored a lot this code generation and also did a release after 20 years and took

07:15.720 --> 07:20.320
over the multi-schema value data which is for loading and understanding the grammar because

07:20.320 --> 07:25.880
we have something called real XMG which is simpler like XSD, grammar and from this we

07:25.880 --> 07:28.600
traverse and are able to generate as much.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.240
There's one three upcoming release.

07:32.240 --> 07:38.120
Now I thought I could do a reset with Michael for Fosten but it was some bugs.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.360
And one at four later.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
Why one at four later?

07:41.360 --> 07:43.200
Let's do the ODFTC update.

07:43.200 --> 07:51.600
You see this was the last release one or two with Sun that was stopping Starfish this year

07:51.600 --> 07:55.520
and it took a while until we made the next release for OASIS.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.520
And now we are closing on ODF.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
There's a link.

07:59.520 --> 08:05.480
You can click on it and see the query of the 66 issues which are already in and then I'll

08:05.480 --> 08:11.440
turn it to the candidates where people can validate from, take something from it.

08:11.440 --> 08:18.280
So there's another thing I did project on a search engine where the text of the data

08:18.280 --> 08:20.720
being extracted from ODF.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.080
I realized there's something missing in ODF.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.960
Just for discussion after something.

08:25.960 --> 08:30.960
It's like we don't have this ODF model in the middle like this feature model and then

08:30.960 --> 08:35.480
we say okay now I tell you how do I do the export.

08:35.480 --> 08:40.960
How should a table look like in Markdown and you can do cherry picking of features.

08:40.960 --> 08:46.520
You like to have in your own format like Markdown or HTML.

08:46.520 --> 08:51.360
I realized that the whole design like we came from XML and later we realized we need this

08:51.360 --> 08:57.600
feature level to abstract from this distinct XML details that this is missing.

08:57.600 --> 09:03.680
So here's some sources left and I really, really love to discuss on some kind of this

09:03.680 --> 09:06.440
later by TB or something.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
Thanks a lot.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
See you next year.

09:08.440 --> 09:15.440
Thank you.
