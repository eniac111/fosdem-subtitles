WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.080
So, I'm Pedro, Pedro Silva, and today we are going to look at how we can make Collabora

00:14.080 --> 00:21.600
Online yours and how those customizations can actually lead into new features while

00:21.600 --> 00:24.080
going through some cool new features.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.480
Why not?

00:25.480 --> 00:34.920
So we start over with these different themes and different aspects that Collabora Online

00:34.920 --> 00:37.120
can have.

00:37.120 --> 00:42.520
But not only we can have these different faces, but we can also have different buttons.

00:42.520 --> 00:47.680
If you have a different button that you'd like to have, or maybe you are hacking on

00:47.680 --> 00:52.120
something and you want to have it in front of a button that triggers something, you can

00:52.120 --> 00:53.420
do that.

00:53.420 --> 01:02.880
And we'll show later how, but spoiler alert, we have an XML file that you can customize

01:02.880 --> 01:09.000
it, we have a post message API that you can actually use that to hack directly onto the

01:09.000 --> 01:11.440
interface and beyond.

01:11.440 --> 01:19.920
And third of all, we also have some kind of cool variables that go through some invisible

01:19.920 --> 01:22.840
input field that then customize it.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.080
So there is a lot of stuff that you can just hack around.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.520
And by the way, LanguageTool, as described by Michael Meeks, thanks to Athvinis, and

01:33.520 --> 01:41.440
we got this cool integration, file properties, another improved and now native functionality.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.560
You see here on this tab, there's plenty of space.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.360
You might want to add a button here.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
Why not?

01:47.360 --> 01:50.680
It's a good candidate to do that.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.720
Our clients, accessibility check.

01:54.720 --> 02:03.720
We go through these new features, how we can create diagrams, and you will soon start to

02:03.720 --> 02:11.040
feel that, okay, this is fitting my workflow, but maybe I want to go a step further.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.720
By the way, we can even do this crazy stuff.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Isn't it crazy?

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
On the browser?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
I don't know.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
I think it's crazy.

02:17.720 --> 02:25.000
Oh, and while doing this, we got a lot of performance wins left and right, which is

02:25.000 --> 02:27.320
it's cool and all, but what about new features?

02:27.320 --> 02:30.400
What about upcoming features?

02:30.400 --> 02:39.600
We work with LibreOffice technology around in a group with friends, and this means not

02:39.600 --> 02:43.440
only the people that are here, but even other people.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.560
For instance, in this case, next cloud, and we are just doing something that can start

02:48.560 --> 02:54.240
with online, then forces us to go to the core to LibreOffice kit, and in the process we

02:54.240 --> 02:56.080
are improving both sides.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.240
That's interesting.

02:58.240 --> 03:08.200
For instance, this is an example with form controls, as Miklos described, content controls,

03:08.200 --> 03:10.160
right?

03:10.160 --> 03:12.280
Repair documents, some other improvements.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.280
How do we make it, how we customize it?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
That's the question.

03:16.280 --> 03:21.760
So, as I hinted before, we can do that via XML, and there is a lot of variables that

03:21.760 --> 03:24.680
you can just turn off.

03:24.680 --> 03:32.240
We even saw it earlier with Pranam's talk, one of those examples, but you can set what's

03:32.240 --> 03:35.160
going to be the default UI mode.

03:35.160 --> 03:42.040
If you want to go a little bit further, you can hack what will be those key colors that

03:42.040 --> 03:49.520
we can see, and you see here the input values that we can pass.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.240
Or why not hack it directly into it?

03:52.240 --> 03:57.640
Maybe you have a different, your native language is not English, and you might want to test

03:57.640 --> 03:59.120
it on that.

03:59.120 --> 04:06.080
Maybe you don't know, but you can add, at the end of your URL, you can add this end

04:06.080 --> 04:13.200
length and for instance, some different language directional layout, and you can test that

04:13.200 --> 04:16.440
and maybe even help us translate.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
Why not?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.480
You can just go to the web later and just start to contribute.

04:20.480 --> 04:28.040
You see, all those things, you are making that yours, because it's answering your problem,

04:28.040 --> 04:33.520
but at the same time, you are helping everyone else, so I think that's the key here.

04:33.520 --> 04:38.840
Or inserting a new custom button, for instance, insert button is just one of the options that

04:38.840 --> 04:43.400
you can use and abuse with PostMessage API.

04:43.400 --> 04:50.640
So if you go to stk.collaboronline.com, slash docs, slash PostMessage API, you will see all

04:50.640 --> 04:58.280
these listed in a table with examples, so you can just hack it.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.400
Have fun with it.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.720
Even if it doesn't work out of the box, even if you are trying to hack something and it

05:05.720 --> 05:07.440
breaks, it's okay.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.920
You can always keep in touch.

05:08.920 --> 05:18.480
You can go to cola slash io, and there is our IRC, our matrix telegram, all these things.

05:18.480 --> 05:26.320
You can report bugs and maybe push a PR, and you will find out that maybe your PR will

05:26.320 --> 05:32.040
leave to learn more about LibreOffice technology, LibreOffice kit, and suddenly you already

05:32.040 --> 05:37.520
have two PRs, both on cola.collaboronline and on Garrett on LibreOffice.

05:37.520 --> 05:42.400
So hopefully it's what will happen.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.200
And while doing that, you have three minutes questions, yes?

05:46.200 --> 05:51.760
And while you are doing that, you will be able to experiment to crazy new features,

05:51.760 --> 05:55.800
the bleeding edge, that still no one knows about it, because you build it.

05:55.800 --> 06:01.160
So maybe you can already see what is happening there, what's the new features, new integration

06:01.160 --> 06:06.920
that's coming, hit on citations, but many more things.

06:06.920 --> 06:15.000
So I hope you take that at heart and give it a go, and join the team.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Thanks.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.200
Any questions?

06:26.200 --> 06:32.600
We've got some two and a half minutes.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.600
Thank you.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
Thank you.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.280
I use cola on my next cloud.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.080
Can I do all this on my next cloud?

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
Yes.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
Is it?

06:42.080 --> 06:49.760
Yes, if you have your built environment, you can hack all these things and have it.

06:49.760 --> 06:53.920
Now if you have a production environment, that's probably what you are hitting at,

06:53.920 --> 06:59.360
okay, then you can still do some of these customizations just by simply hacking on the

06:59.360 --> 07:08.960
coolwst.xml, that it should be under ATC directory, and you should find there, coolwst.xml.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.880
You can, for instance, set up the default UI, what will be the default UI that will

07:12.880 --> 07:18.720
appear if you want to use the integrator's theme or not, for instance, if you are using

07:18.720 --> 07:24.760
next cloud, next cloud has its own theme, so you can hack all these things.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.760
What's the default language?

07:27.760 --> 07:31.680
Maybe you have three or four languages there as a list, and maybe you don't need.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.160
Maybe you just use maybe two, Portuguese or English, and both, two, and you can remove

07:36.160 --> 07:39.360
the others and it will maybe use less resources.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.760
So there is a lot of things you can hack.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.760
Will do, thank you.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.440
30 seconds, one very quick question and answer.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.280
If not, go for the matrix chat.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.280
Thank you.

07:53.280 --> 08:19.800
Thank you.
