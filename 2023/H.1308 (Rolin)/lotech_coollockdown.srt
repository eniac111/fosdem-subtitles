1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:16.520
I will start, hopefully. 30 slides and 10 minutes. Excellent. So, there's a next button

2
0:00:16.520 --> 0:00:21.920
here. Eventually we'll get there. Good. So, a good number of things changed over lockdown

3
0:00:21.920 --> 0:00:27.640
and perhaps you're interested in that. So, Collabra Online is an amazing piece of software

4
0:00:27.640 --> 0:00:33.320
and built on LibreOffice technology. And one of the things that we really, really you'd

5
0:00:33.320 --> 0:00:38.280
have noticed changed, I guess, in lockdown was that we binned this dialogue saying, this

6
0:00:38.280 --> 0:00:43.880
is an unsupported version of whatever. Yeah, we thought this was a good way to encourage

7
0:00:43.880 --> 0:00:50.160
people to consider supporting the project and getting something supported and contributing

8
0:00:50.160 --> 0:00:55.160
back but it turned out everyone hated it. Even I hated it. So, there you go. Even though

9
0:00:55.160 --> 0:01:00.400
it did a good thing. So, we got rid of that and after a large discussion which doesn't

10
0:01:00.400 --> 0:01:06.160
bear repeating, yeah, we then decided to use the Collabra brand to make people aware that

11
0:01:06.160 --> 0:01:09.720
you could get something. So, one of the biggest and most significant changes, I guess, is

12
0:01:09.720 --> 0:01:15.760
removing that and providing then a free version that anyone could deploy at scale without

13
0:01:15.760 --> 0:01:21.520
asking anyone which is kind of cool if you like that sort of thing. And, yes, there's

14
0:01:21.520 --> 0:01:25.160
a bit of a catch-22 there and we unrounded. So, the things that changed, I guess, is now

15
0:01:25.160 --> 0:01:30.800
public unlimited online binaries and we also published all of our SDK documentation, Docker

16
0:01:30.800 --> 0:01:36.680
image build instructions and just got a lot more open. And Italo, wherever he has came

17
0:01:36.680 --> 0:01:43.280
up with this inspired umbrella brand for LibreOffice technology, I guess, that's, yeah, this platform

18
0:01:43.280 --> 0:01:48.040
for personal productivity. So, quite a lot of sort of end user facing change there and

19
0:01:48.040 --> 0:01:53.840
obviously making those two things work together nicely and be friendly is important. So, we

20
0:01:53.840 --> 0:01:58.920
spent lots of time putting, you know, LibreOffice technology logos into the here and there.

21
0:01:58.920 --> 0:02:02.920
Those are such and next cloud office as well. I guess I got these two the wrong way around.

22
0:02:02.920 --> 0:02:07.320
But anyway, and everything was beautiful except no one could see it at TDF. Oh, I need to

23
0:02:07.320 --> 0:02:14.520
move this way, right, out of the frame. Sorry. Because Gillem is a genius and the cleverly

24
0:02:14.520 --> 0:02:19.960
locked down the CSP rule. So, you couldn't actually fetch the logo from your client because

25
0:02:19.960 --> 0:02:25.120
it was forbidden. So, we then had to implement a whole load of work to get the server to

26
0:02:25.120 --> 0:02:29.680
download and then reserve the image. So, there's some kind of funky HTML proxy built into

27
0:02:29.680 --> 0:02:33.840
Cloudbron line for this image. So, anyway, it gets out there now. And so, when you click

28
0:02:33.840 --> 0:02:37.120
on it, you get these nice credits that tell about all the good work that everybody has

29
0:02:37.120 --> 0:02:44.440
done. So, hopefully, there's even pictures you might feature if you're careful. And there's

30
0:02:44.440 --> 0:02:48.280
some more branding there planned. So, we have a welcome stream that comes up now and shows

31
0:02:48.280 --> 0:02:53.440
you the differences and we'd love to get this accelerated. Sadly, we're a bit busy at the

32
0:02:53.440 --> 0:02:58.280
moment, which is good, all good for LibreOffice. So, I just wanted to talk quickly about some

33
0:02:58.280 --> 0:03:02.360
of the things that we've done because that's quite fun in the technology underneath. So,

34
0:03:02.360 --> 0:03:08.040
there you go. Look at this lovely logo. So, one of the things then is to make the blockchain

35
0:03:08.040 --> 0:03:15.160
useful and which means providing money to us to do LibreOffice hacking, obviously. And

36
0:03:15.160 --> 0:03:21.520
so, we got rid of this really deeply annoying dialogue and which was triggered by all these

37
0:03:21.520 --> 0:03:25.000
clever people that accidentally had typed in the far right corner of their spreadsheet

38
0:03:25.000 --> 0:03:30.240
once and made the size apparently larger, which was really good. Hopefully, lots of

39
0:03:30.240 --> 0:03:36.640
people enjoy that. Content controls. So, this is just Microsoft has many strata of content

40
0:03:36.640 --> 0:03:41.400
controls. Every idea has been tried many times. And these are, I guess, the latest one and

41
0:03:41.400 --> 0:03:46.000
say, McClosh has done a fantastic job. I think he had a talk for realness to implement those

42
0:03:46.000 --> 0:04:03.240
so that we can do all sorts of forms and things and then starting to add things on top. There's

43
0:04:03.240 --> 0:04:08.440
color theming, lots of beautiful interoperability work, chart data tables. Everyone likes pictures

44
0:04:08.440 --> 0:04:12.280
or some people like pictures, others like numbers. So, well, you can have both on the

45
0:04:12.280 --> 0:04:20.920
same screen and hopefully see it in your slides, which is kind of cool. Yeah, DeepAll. Yes,

46
0:04:20.920 --> 0:04:26.080
built-in language translation. Just sort of unique to get your German into English or

47
0:04:26.080 --> 0:04:31.580
vice versa. And yeah, that's all good fun and hopefully then with formatting of some

48
0:04:31.580 --> 0:04:35.960
degree as well. You can imagine perhaps the problems of turning this into HTML, translating

49
0:04:35.960 --> 0:04:39.320
it and then trying to get your styles back at the other end. And anyone that wants to

50
0:04:39.320 --> 0:04:45.280
help improve that, I'm sure will be thrilled to have some help making it better. So, that's

51
0:04:45.280 --> 0:04:52.320
all good fun. What else? I missed the button. No? Good. And then there's whole loads of

52
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:55.080
things we've done in Collabor Online. So, one of the things I'm excited about is the

53
0:04:55.080 --> 0:04:59.520
language tool. So, people ask me, what about your artificial intelligence story? And of

54
0:04:59.520 --> 0:05:05.680
course, we need some intelligence around. That's for sure. If only we had some. And a robot

55
0:05:05.680 --> 0:05:11.800
seems like a good way of providing it, reproducible, repeatable. Anyway, the wonderful people at

56
0:05:11.800 --> 0:05:16.640
LanguageTool have managed to build an open source business sort of off the back of Grammarly's

57
0:05:16.640 --> 0:05:22.680
market positioning and price setting skills. And so, they're making money selling open

58
0:05:22.680 --> 0:05:27.120
source things here, built around the open source language tool and contributing loads

59
0:05:27.120 --> 0:05:31.600
of good code. And there will be some pots down. So, it's thrilling to be able to integrate

60
0:05:31.600 --> 0:05:36.680
with them and to get much better grammar checking. And of course, you can run LanguageTool on

61
0:05:36.680 --> 0:05:40.200
your premise. So, you're not sending it all to some random other server. You're sending

62
0:05:40.200 --> 0:05:46.240
it to your own random other server, which is good. So, that's all fun. And then of course,

63
0:05:46.240 --> 0:05:51.000
the Duden corrector has been integrated with people like this. Actually, these are both

64
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:57.000
German companies, I believe. So, your genitives are safe with us. But anyway, so, a similar

65
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:03.680
web service there and that can be integrated. Have reflowing your text, positioning beautiful

66
0:06:03.680 --> 0:06:08.160
boats for core, you know, in just the right place, you know. It's very, very important

67
0:06:08.160 --> 0:06:14.160
to get your images nice. Yeah, it is. You can see the anchor. Yeah, it's one of these

68
0:06:14.160 --> 0:06:17.160
metaphors that's probably not used. It's like the floppy disk anchor, you know. I don't

69
0:06:17.160 --> 0:06:21.480
know how many people sail. But anyway, sailors get their images in good places. And putting

70
0:06:21.480 --> 0:06:26.080
that into the web UI. And there's some chunk of accessibility work and just ease of use

71
0:06:26.080 --> 0:06:33.520
stuff around the formula entry building on Qua-Lons work to make formula entries JS dialogable,

72
0:06:33.520 --> 0:06:38.200
which is all good. That came for our mobile thing. The accessibility checker, I guess

73
0:06:38.200 --> 0:06:42.960
we brought that to the online suite so you can see all of the many failings that you

74
0:06:42.960 --> 0:06:49.000
have in your accessibility. And then maybe fix them, which would be good. And then lots

75
0:06:49.000 --> 0:06:55.040
of work from, I guess, Shimon primarily, but Pedro and others on bringing JS dialogues,

76
0:06:55.040 --> 0:07:03.680
more JS dialogues. So having the dialogues, again, using Qua-Lons WX widgets like welding

77
0:07:03.680 --> 0:07:07.320
framework, we can move these and run them on the client which brings a whole load of

78
0:07:07.320 --> 0:07:14.640
prettiness and performance and accessibility improvements. What else? Deltas. So we also

79
0:07:14.640 --> 0:07:20.640
the way Clabber Online works is it has tiles. It splits your documents into 256 pixel square

80
0:07:20.640 --> 0:07:26.680
tiles, which at least in the past I was told is optimal for some GPUs on mobile phones.

81
0:07:26.680 --> 0:07:32.360
And it seems like a good size. So, yeah, so we do that. But we now use Deltas for that

82
0:07:32.360 --> 0:07:39.920
as well. So as you type your hello or H something, it will find just the H and then it will compress

83
0:07:39.920 --> 0:07:46.120
that. And previously we did this with PNGs. And PNGs, well, they use deflate. Well, as

84
0:07:46.120 --> 0:07:52.880
you can see, really bad. Not only is it slow, it also produces big compressed data. So there

85
0:07:52.880 --> 0:07:59.440
you go. So Z standard is much better and we do that now. And yeah, thanks to Facebook

86
0:07:59.440 --> 0:08:06.240
for their contribution to digital sovereignty and control of your data. That's fantastic.

87
0:08:06.240 --> 0:08:12.720
So what else? Various new exciting dialogues, property things, innumerable PDF options built

88
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:19.640
in. So new export stuff. Some great things there from the team. What else? Online embedded

89
0:08:19.640 --> 0:08:25.560
video playback. If you have embedded videos, you can drop them in and get them. Of course,

90
0:08:25.560 --> 0:08:30.800
Kadex are the hidden nightmare of any kind of video. It's a disaster area. But we just

91
0:08:30.800 --> 0:08:34.680
use what your browser has. So let's hope your browser is doing well. And luckily, browsers

92
0:08:34.680 --> 0:08:39.640
seem to have reasonably good Kadex supports. Somehow, what else can I say? Come heck with

93
0:08:39.640 --> 0:08:46.320
us. It's cool. Talk to us. Get involved. And the cool kids are all using LibreOffice technology.

94
0:08:46.320 --> 0:08:51.080
So you should be too, if you're not. There's a LibreOffice hack fest this Monday and Tuesday.

95
0:08:51.080 --> 0:08:57.000
So that's not tomorrow, but the day is after at the business and technology incubator.

96
0:08:57.000 --> 0:09:02.640
So if you want to be incubating technology, you can get B2K working. It's a great place.

97
0:09:02.640 --> 0:09:06.920
And you can take a photograph and then you'll have all the details you need. And in March,

98
0:09:06.920 --> 0:09:10.360
we're having something in Clare College, Cambridge. Again, you're welcome. There will be a LibreOffice

99
0:09:10.360 --> 0:09:16.200
hack fest there. Come make us open source rock with us. And that's about it. Thank you.

100
0:09:16.200 --> 0:09:30.960
Any questions? OK. 47 seconds for questions. I lie. 42. Never mind. Well, thank you very

101
0:09:30.960 --> 0:09:37.960
much. Grab me a beer afterwards. Thank you.
