0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.860
Welcome back to Gen

2
0:00:05.860 --> 0:00:12.180
A

3
0:00:12.180 --> 0:00:14.360
computer

4
0:00:14.360 --> 0:00:17.080
to be disconnected from the machine.

5
0:00:40.200 --> 0:00:42.760
Hello, my name is Paris

6
0:00:42.760 --> 0:00:48.440
and my talk is about supporting old proprietary graphic formats.

7
0:00:48.440 --> 0:00:54.280
Specifically, we're going to be talking about the WMF and the EMF formats from Windows.

8
0:00:55.960 --> 0:01:03.080
So what is a WMF? And this also applies to the EMFs, but the WMF is a Windows meta file.

9
0:01:03.080 --> 0:01:08.840
It is a graphics format that supports vector and raster operations, mostly vector.

10
0:01:08.840 --> 0:01:12.920
It was introduced in the early 1990s in comparison.

11
0:01:12.920 --> 0:01:18.120
A different vector format like the SVG was released in 2001.

12
0:01:18.120 --> 0:01:23.720
It is composed of a set of GDI drawing commands and structures.

13
0:01:23.720 --> 0:01:32.120
These drawing commands are played back in order to render the graphic within what is known as the playback device context.

14
0:01:32.120 --> 0:01:35.720
And it is not as widely supported as SVGs.

15
0:01:35.720 --> 0:01:43.400
Essentially, this means that you can code this format into existence by writing some GDI functions.

16
0:01:45.400 --> 0:01:48.520
What are the difficulties in supporting this format?

17
0:01:48.520 --> 0:01:53.960
So the WMF files are application and device dependent.

18
0:01:53.960 --> 0:01:59.240
The EMF files later that were later introduced try to solve this issue,

19
0:01:59.240 --> 0:02:04.760
but the WMF files are more difficult in that way.

20
0:02:04.760 --> 0:02:09.720
The device context that is associated with a WMF file cannot be queried.

21
0:02:09.720 --> 0:02:15.320
That is, an application cannot retrieve the device resolution data, font metrics and so on.

22
0:02:15.320 --> 0:02:21.240
So if you made a WMF file for a specific device, you cannot really know.

23
0:02:21.240 --> 0:02:27.960
If you try to render on a different device, you don't really know the device it was built for.

24
0:02:27.960 --> 0:02:32.440
There is a format specification for this, but a lot of things are missing.

25
0:02:32.440 --> 0:02:36.760
And there are some edge cases with undefined behavior.

26
0:02:36.760 --> 0:02:41.880
And pinpointing the root cause of a buggy file can be tricky.

27
0:02:41.880 --> 0:02:45.320
So how do you debug a WMF? Well, there's a lot of ways.

28
0:02:45.320 --> 0:02:50.920
I'm going to present the way that I do it, usually.

29
0:02:50.920 --> 0:02:54.600
So you would want to get the drawing commands, the GDI drawing commands.

30
0:02:54.600 --> 0:02:57.880
And there are multiple ways of doing so more than I listed.

31
0:02:57.880 --> 0:03:02.840
One is MSO dumper. It is created and used by LibreOffice developers.

32
0:03:02.840 --> 0:03:05.560
And it dumps the drawing commands.

33
0:03:05.560 --> 0:03:07.800
Another one is the Metafile Explorer.

34
0:03:08.760 --> 0:03:12.680
It allows for viewing and stepping through the drawing commands.

35
0:03:12.680 --> 0:03:15.880
So you can easily understand which command does what.

36
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:21.320
And then there is the enum Metafile GDI function, which is defined in the GDI header,

37
0:03:22.120 --> 0:03:25.320
which allows to enumerate the drawing commands in WMF file

38
0:03:25.320 --> 0:03:29.960
and call a callback function. A similar function also exists for EMF files.

39
0:03:31.640 --> 0:03:34.280
This is an example of an EMF drawing command.

40
0:03:34.280 --> 0:03:36.840
WMF drawing commands look very similar, of course.

41
0:03:36.840 --> 0:03:39.400
This is the function signature. It takes some parameters.

42
0:03:39.960 --> 0:03:43.480
And this is what the record looks within the file

43
0:03:44.280 --> 0:03:47.160
if you open it in the aforementioned debugger.

44
0:03:48.040 --> 0:03:51.480
So it's very similar to the function signature itself.

45
0:03:51.480 --> 0:03:57.240
So after you obtain the drawing commands, you want to debug.

46
0:03:59.160 --> 0:04:03.880
Because WMF is such a platform-dependent graphic format,

47
0:04:04.520 --> 0:04:09.000
sometimes it's good to compare with other WMF reader implementations,

48
0:04:09.800 --> 0:04:18.760
like PowerPoint, to understand exactly what the graphic looks like in other implementations.

49
0:04:18.760 --> 0:04:24.520
Then you would want to identify which drawing commands cause the bug.

50
0:04:25.160 --> 0:04:27.800
You would, you know, the drawing commands that you obtained,

51
0:04:27.800 --> 0:04:33.320
you would step through them and try to pinpoint what exactly causes the bug.

52
0:04:35.160 --> 0:04:39.320
It is important to also reduce the relevant commands as much as possible.

53
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:43.480
WMF files can contain thousands of drawing commands,

54
0:04:43.480 --> 0:04:47.000
and stepping through all of them is very tricky.

55
0:04:47.000 --> 0:04:50.760
So, for example, a way to do this is to simplify the problematic file

56
0:04:50.760 --> 0:04:54.920
or make a new one that reproduces the bug in LibreOffice.

57
0:04:55.720 --> 0:04:59.960
And then you work around these buggy commands to find out what is wrong.

58
0:05:01.560 --> 0:05:03.480
Easier said than done, but yeah.

59
0:05:05.480 --> 0:05:08.840
Finally, you want to make sure you didn't break something.

60
0:05:09.720 --> 0:05:12.440
It is good to create a unit test for your fix using

61
0:05:12.440 --> 0:05:15.160
the minimally reproducible example you created before.

62
0:05:15.160 --> 0:05:18.920
You run the appropriate test suits, you probably broke something,

63
0:05:18.920 --> 0:05:23.880
so you go back to step one, and then you confirm that round-tripping works as expected.

64
0:05:24.520 --> 0:05:29.640
And then you also, I should mention, monitor the WMF file to,

65
0:05:30.200 --> 0:05:34.200
the fix you made for the WMF file to make sure it doesn't break something in the future.

66
0:05:34.200 --> 0:05:44.200
And that is all. Thank you.
