00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Thank you.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Thank you.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Thank you.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Thank you.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Thank you.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Can I start it?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Okay.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Laszlo Nemec.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.920
And the presentation, title of the presentation, Farm Project by Design, the short, the summary

00:19.920 --> 00:25.840
of my presentation, I don't, whole LibreOffice development can be full of flow, but I can

00:25.840 --> 00:31.520
show the best moment of my recent developments.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.600
So my motto from Goethe, Merlichte, more light.

00:36.600 --> 00:44.080
And in the end, I hope I can give more light about LibreOffice development or fun around

00:44.080 --> 00:45.840
LibreOffice development.

00:45.840 --> 00:52.920
First one, I work it on improving the spelling dictionaries or spellcheckers too in the last

00:52.920 --> 00:54.720
few weeks and months.

00:54.720 --> 01:02.000
And here, there is a Wikipedia one-liner I use to extend the spelling dictionaries, pushing

01:02.000 --> 01:08.080
the word text of the Wikipedia, for example, the Hungarian in my case, to a Unix pipeline

01:08.080 --> 01:13.640
and ranking their entries of the dictionary in the case of the Hungarian.

01:13.640 --> 01:21.320
There was 400,000 entries with a very huge variant of the different localization of the

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
Wikipedia.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.960
And counting their backlinks.

01:24.960 --> 01:33.120
And after that, we have a data about the frequency of the entries and we can filter the unknown

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
words for the spelling dictionary.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.360
Here is the one-liner.

01:36.360 --> 01:44.120
I was so excited to show, to see the Wikipedia XML from downloads from the dump Wikipedia.org

01:44.120 --> 01:53.560
that is five billion characters in a single PC as 50,000 books, the text content of this

01:53.560 --> 01:55.080
single file.

01:55.080 --> 02:01.880
And it was able to create a frequency database immediately.

02:01.880 --> 02:06.440
I called my son that, check this, this is the prototype of the $1 billion algorithm

02:06.440 --> 02:08.440
of Google, the page rank.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.800
Wow, why so wonderful.

02:10.800 --> 02:18.280
He said that it's a little bit late, but no problem because it's not late for me.

02:18.280 --> 02:25.320
When I, I know the Unix pipeline, the history of the Unix line, why so it started with the

02:25.320 --> 02:26.600
moon landing.

02:26.600 --> 02:31.760
I know the history of the graph, so it's related to the language analysis, to the federalist

02:31.760 --> 02:35.200
papers, the founders of the United States.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.840
I was a guy, a man, a linguist, working in the Bell laboratory.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.160
So it's a history, but it's a present.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.920
So that is why interesting that in the liberal office development, like the open office.org

02:48.920 --> 02:56.920
was the first big office suite built on the Solaris system, Sun Microsystem developed

02:56.920 --> 02:59.360
this with joy.

02:59.360 --> 03:07.560
And I use the VI editor and modification by a Dutch face of the developer, the VI version.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.680
So it's a history, but the present too.

03:10.680 --> 03:16.120
And this is the result related to the Hungarian dictionary.

03:16.120 --> 03:23.640
And it seems that humans just want to have more fun because check the most frequent

03:23.640 --> 03:33.760
new unknown words, McLaren or music or soccer, football and car racing, et cetera.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.760
But there was a, in the first, the most frequent dozen words, there was a exception as misfit,

03:39.760 --> 03:45.440
nochny, a small ochrein on village with 1000 people, only 1000 people.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.440
Why?

03:46.440 --> 03:53.240
So I checked the Wikipedia and this was the place of the Crimean astrophysical observatory.

03:53.240 --> 04:05.000
That is a huge number, near 3000 links in the Wikipedia for this, the village, show

04:05.000 --> 04:15.320
me that it means thousands of asteroids, stars, galaxies discovered in this observatory in

04:15.320 --> 04:17.520
the last 100 years.

04:17.520 --> 04:18.920
So it was a nice experience.

04:18.920 --> 04:25.120
I do some other words, not this one to the Hungarian dictionary, for example, Higgs,

04:25.120 --> 04:33.000
the physics related to the gravitational waves or Tice-Tetraops because this extinct animal

04:33.000 --> 04:38.600
is the most popular in the young age people as toddlers.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.400
So sometimes it's useful.

04:40.400 --> 04:46.760
The other development, this is a sort of language, is a mini language to handle a problem, handle

04:46.760 --> 04:53.560
the problem that converting the digits to a written form, the words of a number, for

04:53.560 --> 04:56.920
example, Euro to French.

04:56.920 --> 05:06.000
I'm sorry for my French, but I don't want to pronounce the French version, but I'm sure

05:06.000 --> 05:10.520
there are people here who can help me later.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.680
And this is the history of the source language.

05:12.680 --> 05:19.560
It's related to the software patients because that was in Microsoft, XMS standardization

05:19.560 --> 05:27.240
has very special function, the bat text, using converting numbers to Thai language.

05:27.240 --> 05:35.520
That was maybe Chinese suggestion in the open formal list to create a more generalized version,

05:35.520 --> 05:36.560
number text.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.160
But the answer from the open office dot developer studies and developer at that time, that was

05:42.160 --> 05:46.680
defining a general purpose number that would be a nightmare.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.680
He had the experience.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.400
It's really a nightmare.

05:49.400 --> 05:56.200
And a few years later, I made a one-liner in Ofk, the Unix tool, a prototype to create

05:56.200 --> 06:04.000
something useful, a mini language to describe the different grammar rules of the languages.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.920
And the first version within a week or I don't know, supported the English, Thai, German,

06:11.920 --> 06:15.760
Hungarian, Italian language, and it's a very special numbering system.

06:15.760 --> 06:22.760
Shuzo numbers, which in the night is still used by the Chinese market, two lines of the

06:22.760 --> 06:30.640
numbers with a magnitude of the number, for example, this number is 2023.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.400
And the next line contains the thousand year sign.

06:36.400 --> 06:42.000
The best, the worst problem, so it's not so well the development that this was a spin-off

06:42.000 --> 06:48.480
of my grammar checker development supported by the FSF.H2 foundation.

06:48.480 --> 06:56.520
But that time with three small children without too much money, it was a crazy idea for me

06:56.520 --> 06:58.600
to create a new development.

06:58.600 --> 07:04.960
So that is why I asked the NNet foundation, help of the NNet foundation.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.920
And later, one development, 11 new language support in the software.

07:10.920 --> 07:18.280
And the interesting thing here that when I made a C++ version from this project, also

07:18.280 --> 07:25.920
was funded by an FSF foundation,.H2 foundation, I got help from Ekharathka, at that time a

07:25.920 --> 07:34.080
LibreOffice developer, and later with the Russian developer, Michael Gonski, from Kola

07:34.080 --> 07:41.080
Bora, and now if you check the new features of LibreOffice, you will try to, you will

07:41.080 --> 07:48.840
check the, it's possible to select this format, you will number formats in the dialogue windows,

07:48.840 --> 07:49.960
so useful.

07:49.960 --> 07:55.600
And this was the two characters fixed, but it wasn't able to fix five years ago, because

07:55.600 --> 08:00.680
my, related to my complexity of my development.

08:00.680 --> 08:06.480
LibreLogo, a special language, but not only for children, I will check the next example.

08:06.480 --> 08:12.160
This line fixed the SVG export with the special font features, open type of graphite, so you

08:12.160 --> 08:17.120
can use, for example, the special generated graphics.

08:17.120 --> 08:23.000
About books, I improved the type setting, the paragraph line breaking algorithm, adding

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
the hyphenation zone of the OXM standard, and this standard helped create more DTP-like

08:29.000 --> 08:35.440
text in LibreOffice, my plan to create something better, picture books, thank you very much.

08:35.440 --> 08:44.600
This is the mascot of the LibreLogo development I made last night, the idea is quite new,

08:44.600 --> 08:49.240
and solving a thousand years problem that, what is this?

08:49.240 --> 08:54.440
Log or a crocodile, both of them, log the LibreLogo crocodile.

08:54.440 --> 09:02.680
So 400 bucks fixed in the last four and a half years, for buying me, using special methods,

09:02.680 --> 09:10.600
Unix programming language, or the approach, creating, funding the freedom in these developments.

09:10.600 --> 09:16.920
So you like bug fixing, you can see new features.

09:16.920 --> 09:24.680
A language, for example, 200 years, end of the famous Hungarian poet, Sandor PÃ¤tterty,

09:24.680 --> 09:33.440
made a very short poems you can read later, and these poems are from Goethe and related

09:33.440 --> 09:40.200
to other Tesla who made the biggest innovation in Budapest, thanks to Goethe.

09:40.200 --> 09:47.600
This is the end of my development, and you can check the numbers and the downloader.

09:47.600 --> 10:11.080
Thank you very much.
