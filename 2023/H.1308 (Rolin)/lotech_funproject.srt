1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
Thank you.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:02.000
Thank you.

3
0:00:02.000 --> 0:00:03.000
Thank you.

4
0:00:03.000 --> 0:00:04.000
Thank you.

5
0:00:04.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Thank you.

6
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:06.000
Thank you.

7
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Hi.

8
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:08.000
Can I start it?

9
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:09.000
Okay.

10
0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:10.000
My name is Laszlo Nemec.

11
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:19.920
And the presentation, title of the presentation, Farm Project by Design, the short, the summary

12
0:00:19.920 --> 0:00:25.840
of my presentation, I don't, whole LibreOffice development can be full of flow, but I can

13
0:00:25.840 --> 0:00:31.520
show the best moment of my recent developments.

14
0:00:31.520 --> 0:00:36.600
So my motto from Goethe, Merlichte, more light.

15
0:00:36.600 --> 0:00:44.080
And in the end, I hope I can give more light about LibreOffice development or fun around

16
0:00:44.080 --> 0:00:45.840
LibreOffice development.

17
0:00:45.840 --> 0:00:52.920
First one, I work it on improving the spelling dictionaries or spellcheckers too in the last

18
0:00:52.920 --> 0:00:54.720
few weeks and months.

19
0:00:54.720 --> 0:01:02.000
And here, there is a Wikipedia one-liner I use to extend the spelling dictionaries, pushing

20
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:08.080
the word text of the Wikipedia, for example, the Hungarian in my case, to a Unix pipeline

21
0:01:08.080 --> 0:01:13.640
and ranking their entries of the dictionary in the case of the Hungarian.

22
0:01:13.640 --> 0:01:21.320
There was 400,000 entries with a very huge variant of the different localization of the

23
0:01:21.320 --> 0:01:22.320
Wikipedia.

24
0:01:22.320 --> 0:01:24.960
And counting their backlinks.

25
0:01:24.960 --> 0:01:33.120
And after that, we have a data about the frequency of the entries and we can filter the unknown

26
0:01:33.120 --> 0:01:35.120
words for the spelling dictionary.

27
0:01:35.120 --> 0:01:36.360
Here is the one-liner.

28
0:01:36.360 --> 0:01:44.120
I was so excited to show, to see the Wikipedia XML from downloads from the dump Wikipedia.org

29
0:01:44.120 --> 0:01:53.560
that is five billion characters in a single PC as 50,000 books, the text content of this

30
0:01:53.560 --> 0:01:55.080
single file.

31
0:01:55.080 --> 0:02:01.880
And it was able to create a frequency database immediately.

32
0:02:01.880 --> 0:02:06.440
I called my son that, check this, this is the prototype of the $1 billion algorithm

33
0:02:06.440 --> 0:02:08.440
of Google, the page rank.

34
0:02:08.440 --> 0:02:10.800
Wow, why so wonderful.

35
0:02:10.800 --> 0:02:18.280
He said that it's a little bit late, but no problem because it's not late for me.

36
0:02:18.280 --> 0:02:25.320
When I, I know the Unix pipeline, the history of the Unix line, why so it started with the

37
0:02:25.320 --> 0:02:26.600
moon landing.

38
0:02:26.600 --> 0:02:31.760
I know the history of the graph, so it's related to the language analysis, to the federalist

39
0:02:31.760 --> 0:02:35.200
papers, the founders of the United States.

40
0:02:35.200 --> 0:02:40.840
I was a guy, a man, a linguist, working in the Bell laboratory.

41
0:02:40.840 --> 0:02:44.160
So it's a history, but it's a present.

42
0:02:44.160 --> 0:02:48.920
So that is why interesting that in the liberal office development, like the open office.org

43
0:02:48.920 --> 0:02:56.920
was the first big office suite built on the Solaris system, Sun Microsystem developed

44
0:02:56.920 --> 0:02:59.360
this with joy.

45
0:02:59.360 --> 0:03:07.560
And I use the VI editor and modification by a Dutch face of the developer, the VI version.

46
0:03:07.560 --> 0:03:10.680
So it's a history, but the present too.

47
0:03:10.680 --> 0:03:16.120
And this is the result related to the Hungarian dictionary.

48
0:03:16.120 --> 0:03:23.640
And it seems that humans just want to have more fun because check the most frequent

49
0:03:23.640 --> 0:03:33.760
new unknown words, McLaren or music or soccer, football and car racing, et cetera.

50
0:03:33.760 --> 0:03:39.760
But there was a, in the first, the most frequent dozen words, there was a exception as misfit,

51
0:03:39.760 --> 0:03:45.440
nochny, a small ochrein on village with 1000 people, only 1000 people.

52
0:03:45.440 --> 0:03:46.440
Why?

53
0:03:46.440 --> 0:03:53.240
So I checked the Wikipedia and this was the place of the Crimean astrophysical observatory.

54
0:03:53.240 --> 0:04:05.000
That is a huge number, near 3000 links in the Wikipedia for this, the village, show

55
0:04:05.000 --> 0:04:15.320
me that it means thousands of asteroids, stars, galaxies discovered in this observatory in

56
0:04:15.320 --> 0:04:17.520
the last 100 years.

57
0:04:17.520 --> 0:04:18.920
So it was a nice experience.

58
0:04:18.920 --> 0:04:25.120
I do some other words, not this one to the Hungarian dictionary, for example, Higgs,

59
0:04:25.120 --> 0:04:33.000
the physics related to the gravitational waves or Tice-Tetraops because this extinct animal

60
0:04:33.000 --> 0:04:38.600
is the most popular in the young age people as toddlers.

61
0:04:38.600 --> 0:04:40.400
So sometimes it's useful.

62
0:04:40.400 --> 0:04:46.760
The other development, this is a sort of language, is a mini language to handle a problem, handle

63
0:04:46.760 --> 0:04:53.560
the problem that converting the digits to a written form, the words of a number, for

64
0:04:53.560 --> 0:04:56.920
example, Euro to French.

65
0:04:56.920 --> 0:05:06.000
I'm sorry for my French, but I don't want to pronounce the French version, but I'm sure

66
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:10.520
there are people here who can help me later.

67
0:05:10.520 --> 0:05:12.680
And this is the history of the source language.

68
0:05:12.680 --> 0:05:19.560
It's related to the software patients because that was in Microsoft, XMS standardization

69
0:05:19.560 --> 0:05:27.240
has very special function, the bat text, using converting numbers to Thai language.

70
0:05:27.240 --> 0:05:35.520
That was maybe Chinese suggestion in the open formal list to create a more generalized version,

71
0:05:35.520 --> 0:05:36.560
number text.

72
0:05:36.560 --> 0:05:42.160
But the answer from the open office dot developer studies and developer at that time, that was

73
0:05:42.160 --> 0:05:46.680
defining a general purpose number that would be a nightmare.

74
0:05:46.680 --> 0:05:47.680
He had the experience.

75
0:05:47.680 --> 0:05:49.400
It's really a nightmare.

76
0:05:49.400 --> 0:05:56.200
And a few years later, I made a one-liner in Ofk, the Unix tool, a prototype to create

77
0:05:56.200 --> 0:06:04.000
something useful, a mini language to describe the different grammar rules of the languages.

78
0:06:04.000 --> 0:06:11.920
And the first version within a week or I don't know, supported the English, Thai, German,

79
0:06:11.920 --> 0:06:15.760
Hungarian, Italian language, and it's a very special numbering system.

80
0:06:15.760 --> 0:06:22.760
Shuzo numbers, which in the night is still used by the Chinese market, two lines of the

81
0:06:22.760 --> 0:06:30.640
numbers with a magnitude of the number, for example, this number is 2023.

82
0:06:30.640 --> 0:06:36.400
And the next line contains the thousand year sign.

83
0:06:36.400 --> 0:06:42.000
The best, the worst problem, so it's not so well the development that this was a spin-off

84
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:48.480
of my grammar checker development supported by the FSF.H2 foundation.

85
0:06:48.480 --> 0:06:56.520
But that time with three small children without too much money, it was a crazy idea for me

86
0:06:56.520 --> 0:06:58.600
to create a new development.

87
0:06:58.600 --> 0:07:04.960
So that is why I asked the NNet foundation, help of the NNet foundation.

88
0:07:04.960 --> 0:07:10.920
And later, one development, 11 new language support in the software.

89
0:07:10.920 --> 0:07:18.280
And the interesting thing here that when I made a C++ version from this project, also

90
0:07:18.280 --> 0:07:25.920
was funded by an FSF foundation,.H2 foundation, I got help from Ekharathka, at that time a

91
0:07:25.920 --> 0:07:34.080
LibreOffice developer, and later with the Russian developer, Michael Gonski, from Kola

92
0:07:34.080 --> 0:07:41.080
Bora, and now if you check the new features of LibreOffice, you will try to, you will

93
0:07:41.080 --> 0:07:48.840
check the, it's possible to select this format, you will number formats in the dialogue windows,

94
0:07:48.840 --> 0:07:49.960
so useful.

95
0:07:49.960 --> 0:07:55.600
And this was the two characters fixed, but it wasn't able to fix five years ago, because

96
0:07:55.600 --> 0:08:00.680
my, related to my complexity of my development.

97
0:08:00.680 --> 0:08:06.480
LibreLogo, a special language, but not only for children, I will check the next example.

98
0:08:06.480 --> 0:08:12.160
This line fixed the SVG export with the special font features, open type of graphite, so you

99
0:08:12.160 --> 0:08:17.120
can use, for example, the special generated graphics.

100
0:08:17.120 --> 0:08:23.000
About books, I improved the type setting, the paragraph line breaking algorithm, adding

101
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:29.000
the hyphenation zone of the OXM standard, and this standard helped create more DTP-like

102
0:08:29.000 --> 0:08:35.440
text in LibreOffice, my plan to create something better, picture books, thank you very much.

103
0:08:35.440 --> 0:08:44.600
This is the mascot of the LibreLogo development I made last night, the idea is quite new,

104
0:08:44.600 --> 0:08:49.240
and solving a thousand years problem that, what is this?

105
0:08:49.240 --> 0:08:54.440
Log or a crocodile, both of them, log the LibreLogo crocodile.

106
0:08:54.440 --> 0:09:02.680
So 400 bucks fixed in the last four and a half years, for buying me, using special methods,

107
0:09:02.680 --> 0:09:10.600
Unix programming language, or the approach, creating, funding the freedom in these developments.

108
0:09:10.600 --> 0:09:16.920
So you like bug fixing, you can see new features.

109
0:09:16.920 --> 0:09:24.680
A language, for example, 200 years, end of the famous Hungarian poet, Sandor Pätterty,

110
0:09:24.680 --> 0:09:33.440
made a very short poems you can read later, and these poems are from Goethe and related

111
0:09:33.440 --> 0:09:40.200
to other Tesla who made the biggest innovation in Budapest, thanks to Goethe.

112
0:09:40.200 --> 0:09:47.600
This is the end of my development, and you can check the numbers and the downloader.

113
0:09:47.600 --> 0:10:11.080
Thank you very much.
