0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.600
Okay, let's start. It's quite 3 p.m. Hello, my name is Sverda Becker. Welcome to my talk

2
0:00:13.600 --> 0:00:23.480
to migrating to LibreOffice technology, old and new motivations and challenges. Well,

3
0:00:23.480 --> 0:00:31.880
migrating to LibreOffice technology is a very complex task in technical issues and non-technical

4
0:00:31.880 --> 0:00:42.040
issues. So, both worlds where we come from, from a proper attire office suite to a free

5
0:00:42.040 --> 0:00:48.560
office suite like LibreOffice and LibreOffice technology once, develop further. These tasks

6
0:00:48.560 --> 0:00:57.520
are done now, for example, by me for over 20 years. And so, in the meantime, the technologies,

7
0:00:57.520 --> 0:01:04.720
both worlds are evolving further and it makes sense to think about old things which are

8
0:01:04.720 --> 0:01:13.680
deprecated, old motivations and new one which is coming up with new versions of both worlds.

9
0:01:13.680 --> 0:01:22.240
So, with respect to the time of 10 minutes, it's very, very short for such an item. I

10
0:01:22.240 --> 0:01:31.720
have chosen five items. I think the most important one and there are some new ones in it which

11
0:01:31.720 --> 0:01:37.120
I want to bring to discussion if you have time to discuss or ask me later if you want

12
0:01:37.120 --> 0:01:49.400
to have more here in this. So, the first one is, is it working? The first one is an old

13
0:01:49.400 --> 0:01:59.160
one and a new one and it means desktop client is still and will still be there. Everybody

14
0:01:59.160 --> 0:02:06.800
is going to cloud, to online and so on. But, as you could imagine, in a professional environment,

15
0:02:06.800 --> 0:02:13.600
you are sometimes in regional or in areas where no internet or bad internet connection

16
0:02:13.600 --> 0:02:26.400
is and you have to work there as well for your job or something like this. So, the most

17
0:02:26.400 --> 0:02:31.520
deployments are going with the solution that you have and the possibility to work online

18
0:02:31.520 --> 0:02:40.240
and have an additional office suite installation on your client. This will be, especially in

19
0:02:40.240 --> 0:02:47.000
Germany where such regions where you have no or bad internet connections, a long time

20
0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:57.600
last. So, I mentioned these new developments in both worlds and both office worlds. So,

21
0:02:57.600 --> 0:03:03.040
there are some new, over the time, there are some new functional and UI developments which

22
0:03:03.040 --> 0:03:10.920
are, some of them are positive for our world, for our technology world and some are negative,

23
0:03:10.920 --> 0:03:17.080
have negative motivations for a migration. So, let me start with a positive one. One

24
0:03:17.080 --> 0:03:25.160
is in the client, in the office client, positive for us, if you have a look in the new Microsoft

25
0:03:25.160 --> 0:03:32.680
Office client that there is working with format templates which is very important in professional

26
0:03:32.680 --> 0:03:40.840
document processing is becoming more and more obscure for the user. So, it is hidden for

27
0:03:40.840 --> 0:03:48.560
the user that it would be nice to work with templates and we are in favor of working with

28
0:03:48.560 --> 0:03:53.400
such templates. The negative side is, if you have a look in these new versions of Microsoft

29
0:03:53.400 --> 0:04:01.760
Office, you can experience that there are a lot of new assistance and automatisms which

30
0:04:01.760 --> 0:04:12.720
are partially laid upon artificial intelligence and this is a kind of functionality we totally

31
0:04:12.720 --> 0:04:19.520
miss in LibreOffice. That is one example for it where we did it. It is the integration

32
0:04:19.520 --> 0:04:28.200
of the deeper translation, the possible integration into your text processing to translate, but

33
0:04:28.200 --> 0:04:39.520
this is just one. Yes, it is a two-sided coin. Some users are totally fine with these automatisms,

34
0:04:39.520 --> 0:04:47.280
but the negative side is that functionality is hidden behind such assistance and they

35
0:04:47.280 --> 0:04:56.040
do not know what is happening in the document and could not work with it. The second one

36
0:04:56.040 --> 0:05:04.640
I want to highlight is also node one. It is the task for a migration to have the right

37
0:05:04.640 --> 0:05:12.720
strategy for the document format in-house and for interoperability aspects. I think

38
0:05:12.720 --> 0:05:21.600
this is a well-known item, but with new versions of the document format as well in the proper

39
0:05:21.600 --> 0:05:30.240
attire world as well as in our world, it is becoming more and more complex. For example,

40
0:05:30.240 --> 0:05:38.320
Microsoft is nowadays supporting also open document format, but if you try to define

41
0:05:38.320 --> 0:05:46.880
which version of the document format they support, you are a little bit lost in space,

42
0:05:46.880 --> 0:05:54.720
so there are some interoperability issues for ODF in the other world and it is intransplorent.

43
0:05:54.720 --> 0:06:02.640
What is very interesting in a few last migrations we did for professional deployments, we have

44
0:06:02.640 --> 0:06:09.440
some aspects in the interoperability from LibreOffice to OpenOffice and back. OpenOffice

45
0:06:09.440 --> 0:06:19.280
is still on Open Document Format version 1.2. We in LibreOffice technology on 1.3 and extended,

46
0:06:19.280 --> 0:06:27.280
if you choose the standard one, and there are some issues sending ODF documents to

47
0:06:27.280 --> 0:06:40.560
other people who use OpenOffice. Next one is indeed a new one. You all know this big issue or

48
0:06:40.560 --> 0:06:48.480
item of digital sovereignty. It's a huge wave of expectations coming to us, especially to the Office

49
0:06:48.480 --> 0:07:00.720
Suite, to do all the expectations around it for free and open software. So they are becoming more

50
0:07:00.720 --> 0:07:08.640
and more aware about dependencies in the proprietary world and they want like a big bang, get everything,

51
0:07:09.440 --> 0:07:16.640
something like in one-stop shopping, we say, just click install and you have all ours integrated,

52
0:07:16.640 --> 0:07:26.960
even with other tools we have not in the LibreOffice technology like chat, like collaboration and so on.

53
0:07:29.600 --> 0:07:37.360
And this is, as I said, a man out of the box, so doing it in a big bang and all who are doing

54
0:07:37.360 --> 0:07:50.640
migrations know that this expectation of one big bang is not very realistic. So the next one is

55
0:07:50.640 --> 0:07:59.920
online compilation and smart devices. Also a good side and a bad side. Good side is if you have a

56
0:07:59.920 --> 0:08:06.800
look in the Microsoft Office online apps, it's a total disaster. It's a total disaster and this

57
0:08:06.800 --> 0:08:14.400
is a point where we with solutions in LibreOffice technology are on the positive side,

58
0:08:14.400 --> 0:08:20.800
definitely are on the positive side. Upcoming more and more, it's very, very interesting. We have a

59
0:08:20.800 --> 0:08:27.840
long time where synchronous collaboration was out of no value, but this is coming up more and more

60
0:08:27.840 --> 0:08:35.920
and more with this pandemic home office work. More people are working synchronously on the same

61
0:08:35.920 --> 0:08:44.720
document. Other stuff like file sharing you have to do with tasks for file sharing, integration

62
0:08:44.720 --> 0:08:53.600
with chats and so on. And the differentiation between online and smart devices is not known

63
0:08:53.600 --> 0:09:01.040
by the user. It's the same for them that they are doing their work online or on a smartphone. We all

64
0:09:01.040 --> 0:09:07.840
know that this is definitely not the same with the apps on the smart devices and the online office.

65
0:09:09.120 --> 0:09:16.560
I have to hurry up. I'm sorry. Last one is also a new one. It's an interesting development. We

66
0:09:16.560 --> 0:09:24.480
have long worked to have this notebook bar UI and more and more is the notebook bar seen as the

67
0:09:24.480 --> 0:09:34.560
standard UI. What we get is that we have more efforts, have to make more efforts and migrations

68
0:09:34.560 --> 0:09:41.840
for training and support in different user interfaces. There's an additional aspect we

69
0:09:41.840 --> 0:09:52.080
have to have be careful what we are doing on this different devices, client UI, online UI and mobile

70
0:09:52.080 --> 0:10:04.240
UI, which can confuse the user a lot with it. So what is TDF doing for such

71
0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:13.840
challenges in migrations? What we are doing is we are certifying people in three different areas,

72
0:10:13.840 --> 0:10:18.800
professional developer, which are doing supporting stuff. If you have integration

73
0:10:18.800 --> 0:10:27.120
tasks and so on, we have professional migrators and professional trainers. If you want to know

74
0:10:27.120 --> 0:10:36.000
more about that, please visit the document.com. You can see what we are doing there. It's a very

75
0:10:36.000 --> 0:10:44.240
special certification and it covers exactly the aspect of these challenges to have the best

76
0:10:44.240 --> 0:10:54.240
quality in migrations. If there are questions, I'm around and come to me and pass.
