00:00.000 --> 00:18.560
I am a software engineer at Colabora.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.240
I just recently joined them.

00:22.240 --> 00:28.960
This is my first conference and I am not very good in English, so forgive me if I say something

00:28.960 --> 00:29.960
wrong.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.920
I will speak about the footnotes in multi column sections.

00:36.920 --> 00:45.000
I worked on this last year, a year ago.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.160
I thought it can be an interesting problem.

00:49.160 --> 00:55.120
Oh, I had to go back.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.960
So I got a back ticket to a fix and it was a very simple ticket at first sight.

01:02.960 --> 01:10.160
It was only just one line text and some way the writer displayed it as two pages and why

01:10.160 --> 01:14.880
the word was displayed just one page.

01:14.880 --> 01:21.160
Beside the one line text there was a footnote and its section has two columns and there

01:21.160 --> 01:24.400
was a continuous section break.

01:24.400 --> 01:32.280
First I thought it was a problem about the section break, some way it changed to a page

01:32.280 --> 01:33.920
break or something like that.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.000
But that was an instinct.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.640
It was a strange thing why the footnote and the column were needed.

01:43.640 --> 01:53.760
If I deleted any of them, then the writer changed to one page and it was okay.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.100
It was changed why it is needed.

01:56.100 --> 02:06.760
So I started to debug to find where it's become two page and I found the problem in the layout

02:06.760 --> 02:18.320
in calculation and there was even a comment about it stating that the footnote container

02:18.320 --> 02:22.960
causes to maximize size in this case.

02:22.960 --> 02:37.480
This function to maximize function will calculate if we have to maximize the column frame, the

02:37.480 --> 02:41.240
whole section frame to the whole page.

02:41.240 --> 02:50.840
And it has several conditions like is footnote at end and is end note at end.

02:50.840 --> 03:03.160
They are check boxes on the GUI named collect at end of text and call at end of section

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
for end notes.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.160
They are diverse falls in this case.

03:07.160 --> 03:11.480
Oh, the hasfollow isn't matter now.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.360
It was falls in this case too.

03:14.360 --> 03:20.680
But there was another function that contains footnote container.

03:20.680 --> 03:31.160
I checked this function and this function just blindly check if the section have column

03:31.160 --> 03:38.520
frame tried that has a footnote container frame tried and if it has one, then it returned

03:38.520 --> 03:40.560
the first one it found.

03:40.560 --> 03:48.540
So it seems the function was directly righted like this way.

03:48.540 --> 03:56.400
So the question was why do we want to break a page in this case?

03:56.400 --> 04:02.720
I even checked the git who changed it or something like that.

04:02.720 --> 04:13.040
But it was in the very first commit I could reach in the initial import at 2000 years.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.440
And nobody changed it.

04:15.440 --> 04:21.760
And I was even wonder why this many condition is needed.

04:21.760 --> 04:30.400
Not just the first one I found, but the note collect at end is still needed for it.

04:30.400 --> 04:36.720
For this I had to analyze the frames how they work.

04:36.720 --> 04:43.960
So I listed the frames related to footnote some case.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.280
The footnote frame is for one footnote entity.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.600
It can contain a text frame.

04:53.600 --> 04:59.640
And this can be in a footnote container frame.

04:59.640 --> 05:07.040
And that frame contains a list of footnotes.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.440
It's important it's not two-dimensional list.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.840
It's just a simple list that it can display.

05:14.840 --> 05:24.960
And this footnote container frame can be in a page frame or a column frame.

05:24.960 --> 05:33.880
So what is important in it that the footnote container frame does not really support columns.

05:33.880 --> 05:39.920
It just a I could say just one column of footnotes and that's all.

05:39.920 --> 05:46.680
But we can put this container frame in any of the column frame event.

05:46.680 --> 05:55.720
So if we put this container frames in every column frame then it will seems like if we

05:55.720 --> 06:05.680
support oh sorry it's like we support multi columns.

06:05.680 --> 06:13.960
So in one case we want footnote like multi columns as like it in the word.

06:13.960 --> 06:21.480
In the other case we want if we don't check the collected and text we want the footnote

06:21.480 --> 06:23.040
to be at the page end.

06:23.040 --> 06:29.680
In the other case we want the footnote to be in the columns end in physical as we say

06:29.680 --> 06:31.120
in the display.

06:31.120 --> 06:36.620
And it can be true only if the column end is equal to the page end.

06:36.620 --> 06:42.920
So that's why they maximize the size of the column to the page size.

06:42.920 --> 06:52.640
In our case it's not a good idea because in my test case there was only one footnote

06:52.640 --> 06:58.460
and it doesn't need to be multi columns.

06:58.460 --> 07:13.480
But if we wouldn't do this what I showed in the previous slide there could be a contradiction

07:13.480 --> 07:17.760
like I made a test document.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.040
There is two section.

07:19.040 --> 07:28.520
I checked the collected end of text which means I want the footnote be after the section

07:28.520 --> 07:29.520
end.

07:29.520 --> 07:35.120
There is two column at the first section and three column at the second section.

07:35.120 --> 07:42.960
It's very good in this way but if we would change the collected end of text we would

07:42.960 --> 07:44.280
uncheck this.

07:44.280 --> 07:54.200
I mean we want all of this footnote at the end of the page then how many columns we want?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.200
It's a contradiction.

07:55.200 --> 08:07.020
We can't say that two or three because any of them could be wrong.

08:07.020 --> 08:17.400
So what we should need we should be able to have column children for the container frame

08:17.400 --> 08:31.200
because it's not should be, it must be, it just should be like words able to have indifferent

08:31.200 --> 08:36.040
number of columns at page as many as in the text.

08:36.040 --> 08:44.320
So we should have the ability for the users to choose how many columns we want in the

08:44.320 --> 09:13.920
footnote but we should keep the ability to, that's all, okay, sorry, it's almost end.
