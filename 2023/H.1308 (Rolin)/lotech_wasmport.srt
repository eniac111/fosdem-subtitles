1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.200
Okay, let's go. It's me again. Somebody just throw some, I don't know, vegetables at me

2
0:00:12.200 --> 0:00:19.660
if the 10 minutes are over. If you came for WebAssembly here, I have to disappoint you.

3
0:00:19.660 --> 0:00:25.080
So we'll have to wait another one or two talks when we will talk about that. I repurposed

4
0:00:25.080 --> 0:00:31.160
the slot here to talk a little bit about something equally cool, wonderful, spiffy with a rocket

5
0:00:31.160 --> 0:00:38.840
engine for LibreOffice templates. Well, small disappointment, it's about warmocks. But I

6
0:00:38.840 --> 0:00:49.240
think it's a kind of serious there, perhaps the name we could think about a different

7
0:00:49.240 --> 0:00:59.800
one. So quick intro, what is that? If you haven't heard about it. It's a Java extension

8
0:00:59.800 --> 0:01:07.240
to LibreOffice. And it's there for template and forms management and also like extending

9
0:01:07.240 --> 0:01:13.760
mail merge. So those are two views on it. The left one is the sidebar extension. You

10
0:01:13.760 --> 0:01:21.920
see three sidebar panels been added there. This is just a selection of sample templates

11
0:01:21.920 --> 0:01:32.120
there. And the right side is the kind of constructed generated document out of that thing. So all

12
0:01:32.120 --> 0:01:42.960
of that has been developed by the city of Munich, starting around 2005ish to 2006ish

13
0:01:42.960 --> 0:01:49.880
under the Linux project umbrella. Why? Because they wanted to migrate to OpenOffice. They

14
0:01:49.880 --> 0:01:55.320
wanted some template management and there was nothing that was powerful enough. So they

15
0:01:55.320 --> 0:02:01.120
did what you do when it's not there. And you do open sourcey stuff. You started doing something

16
0:02:01.120 --> 0:02:08.680
yourself. And then open source it. So that's what Munich did. And there was some well,

17
0:02:08.680 --> 0:02:15.280
it was in production I think since 2008 and there was some major upgrade to LibreOffice

18
0:02:15.280 --> 0:02:23.440
from OpenOffice which had some we had to change some UNO stuff there. And another major rework

19
0:02:23.440 --> 0:02:31.200
migrating from Java swing dialogues and UI to native LibreOffice UI and mostly sidebar

20
0:02:31.200 --> 0:02:39.800
which really nicely integrates as you've seen before. And this year or end of last year

21
0:02:39.800 --> 0:02:49.520
since the Linux project is kind of sun setting, the extension itself which is extremely powerful,

22
0:02:49.520 --> 0:02:55.440
incredibly great, also cool for QA because it triggers really literally every little

23
0:02:55.440 --> 0:03:04.120
corner of the writer UNO API there. Moving house to TDF. Again, what is it in the first

24
0:03:04.120 --> 0:03:11.880
place? It's predominantly for let's say very complex document generation workflows. That

25
0:03:11.880 --> 0:03:18.440
you will find in larger companies, perhaps also in law firms or something but predominantly

26
0:03:18.440 --> 0:03:26.920
in the public sector. The idea behind there is kind of assemble your letter on the fly

27
0:03:26.920 --> 0:03:34.440
and employ the dry principle and only ever have one stylistic element or part of the

28
0:03:34.440 --> 0:03:41.920
template defined once and then you kind of include that like PHP or other template programming

29
0:03:41.920 --> 0:03:49.000
languages so you kind of piece that together. There's also like loops and control flow statements

30
0:03:49.000 --> 0:03:54.920
that you can use to kind of very dynamically generate forms. There's a forms generator

31
0:03:54.920 --> 0:04:01.580
so you can kind of have some user guidance like where to fill in what and pre-fill things

32
0:04:01.580 --> 0:04:07.520
and also dynamically kind of say oh when this is on then do that or not to do that or disable

33
0:04:07.520 --> 0:04:16.000
here. As I said mail merge stuff and text programming and quotes content based directors

34
0:04:16.000 --> 0:04:25.920
for doing something very dynamic. That thing has now moved to TDF. End of last year and

35
0:04:25.920 --> 0:04:32.880
we have been quite busy first of all doing the move and also doing some adaptations and

36
0:04:32.880 --> 0:04:38.720
adjustments and getting it kind of fit for let's say an international open source project

37
0:04:38.720 --> 0:04:47.120
like LibreOffice. What happened? Git repos moved to under the LibreOffice project on

38
0:04:47.120 --> 0:04:53.920
GitHub which was an easy like click so the old URL still work. You got a redirect that's

39
0:04:53.920 --> 0:04:59.520
pretty nice feature on GitHub so everybody can still who had this clone can still work

40
0:04:59.520 --> 0:05:07.200
with it but the official location is now there. We added some translation workflow stuff.

41
0:05:07.200 --> 0:05:15.680
We made the Java like everything that was a user visible string and the Java sources

42
0:05:15.680 --> 0:05:22.520
is now on PO files. We put this on TDF's web plate so the UI can be translated. We moved

43
0:05:22.520 --> 0:05:30.440
the documentation from a markdown Git based workflow into MediaWiki which is also much

44
0:05:30.440 --> 0:05:36.640
nicer than to translate for the community. For this markdown stuff we essentially needed

45
0:05:36.640 --> 0:05:45.000
some kind of developer set up to do that and MediaWiki has really nice excellent translation

46
0:05:45.000 --> 0:05:51.440
support meanwhile. Fixed a number of bugs. Made sure that it actually works not just

47
0:05:51.440 --> 0:05:58.400
with all the LibreOffice versions but with the most recent ones. We did some build fixes

48
0:05:58.400 --> 0:06:05.520
on the bits of the internal build system kind of leaking through that still so we made it

49
0:06:05.520 --> 0:06:11.600
actually build out of the box. You clone that, you build that with Maven and it actually

50
0:06:11.600 --> 0:06:18.440
works. Some tweaks with namespaces so we can then upload artifacts to the LibreOffice Maven

51
0:06:18.440 --> 0:06:25.200
repository and it doesn't have the old names anymore that were kind of sometimes internal

52
0:06:25.200 --> 0:06:33.120
to city of Munich. We set up Jenkins jobs so we can actually not only run tests on pull

53
0:06:33.120 --> 0:06:41.480
requests, we can also run releases there on the CI and tons of smaller things like started

54
0:06:41.480 --> 0:06:49.560
to do comment translation in the code, renamed variable names, got the built-out and other

55
0:06:49.560 --> 0:06:57.600
auxiliary documentation translated to English. It's not done in particular the code stuff.

56
0:06:57.600 --> 0:07:04.640
That's not done. Part of that was already English but there's quite a bit left. Which

57
0:07:04.640 --> 0:07:17.920
gets us to next steps and the possible future. So, handbook is not fully line of super clean.

58
0:07:17.920 --> 0:07:22.680
The original handbook was German so we translated it to English and then we wanted to reuse

59
0:07:22.680 --> 0:07:28.240
the old German translation because why do that work again? With the big key markup so

60
0:07:28.240 --> 0:07:33.080
that's kind of busy work there and we're kind of still mostly gone, we're still busy with

61
0:07:33.080 --> 0:07:43.040
that. I guess help appreciate it but no, not okay. So, we get it done in the very near

62
0:07:43.040 --> 0:07:53.040
future. Some renaming for the Java packages that kind of blocks each other with possibly

63
0:07:53.040 --> 0:07:58.920
renaming the project. We don't want to rename it twice. Have some new landing page done.

64
0:07:58.920 --> 0:08:05.520
Some more bug fixing. There's still some sidebar, not so nice things and some thing that was

65
0:08:05.520 --> 0:08:11.840
one crash somewhere and then we want to reasonably soonish have some release there so that people

66
0:08:11.840 --> 0:08:18.920
actually can use that. If anybody's interested we can have some snapshots possibly published.

67
0:08:18.920 --> 0:08:25.160
Then again it should be relatively easy to build and if it's not let's fix it. So, actually

68
0:08:25.160 --> 0:08:31.960
maybe not publishing snapshots far and wide is a feature, not a bug. So, we can fix the

69
0:08:31.960 --> 0:08:40.720
build system. Yeah, renaming. So, we kind of brainstormed a little bit in the background.

70
0:08:40.720 --> 0:08:51.080
Those are three suggestions that we will probably mull over and think about. So, this LibreOffice

71
0:08:51.080 --> 0:08:58.040
template tool or template engine is probably what it actually is. So, people would understand

72
0:08:58.040 --> 0:09:04.960
what it does when they see that somewhere. This forms and templates is a bit more ambitious

73
0:09:04.960 --> 0:09:13.320
because it does much more than just templates. But hey, naming is hard. So, yeah. And if

74
0:09:13.320 --> 0:09:17.680
you're curious, come and help. So, there's some easy hack there for common translation.

75
0:09:17.680 --> 0:09:23.840
It's the easiest thing to get your feedback. There's certainly more like UI and document

76
0:09:23.840 --> 0:09:30.680
translation. That would be great. And of course, if you have cool feature ideas, go get it

77
0:09:30.680 --> 0:09:35.800
implemented. So, there's one thing. That is there's an old branch about QR code support.

78
0:09:35.800 --> 0:09:42.760
So, you can kind of generate QR code and insert it like in this process of programmed software

79
0:09:42.760 --> 0:09:49.320
controlled template generation. That would be nice to get in or other things that people

80
0:09:49.320 --> 0:10:13.600
want to templates these days. Okay. And that's it. Thanks so much.
