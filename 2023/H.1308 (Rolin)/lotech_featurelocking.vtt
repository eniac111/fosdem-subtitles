I'm not Pranam. But Pranam couldn't be here because of all these visa problems and things

00:15.040 --> 00:24.560
like this. So I will be speaking on his behalf. And plus I also work with him on this section.

00:24.560 --> 00:31.240
So I think it's okay. Okay, so I'm Pedro, by the way. Pedro Silva. So I'm now talking

00:31.240 --> 00:39.440
on behalf of Pranam. So what is feature restrictions and feature locking? It was a section developed

00:39.440 --> 00:48.760
by Pranam within Collab Online. And the main goal here was to add an additional lever,

00:48.760 --> 00:58.720
an additional option to any sysadmin. So basically it's a switcher or perhaps better described

00:58.720 --> 01:07.800
as a set of switchers that allow sysadmin to hide a set of features. Maybe you want

01:07.800 --> 01:16.760
to restrict the usage of your resources. Or maybe other option. Maybe you just want to

01:16.760 --> 01:23.080
avoid the users to use, I don't know, formatting a cell or something like this. There is a

01:23.080 --> 01:31.160
lot of these use cases that you can have for hiding those features, which is useful. So

01:31.160 --> 01:38.760
it's always this on-off straightforward switcher. But what if you do not want to hide completely

01:38.760 --> 01:44.920
the feature, you just want to lock it. So imagine, I don't know, again a sysadmin,

01:44.920 --> 01:52.560
a host or an integrator, might have higher ceiling, but that higher ceiling for system

01:52.560 --> 02:02.200
resources, they need to be maybe either paid by the user, but still they want to offer

02:02.200 --> 02:10.760
this initial, I don't know, initial, this hostage that they normally have packaged with

02:10.760 --> 02:20.960
a completely gratis set of softwares. And this is where feature locking enters in. So

02:20.960 --> 02:30.320
as it says here, it basically adds this lock icon and then the user, imaginary case scenario,

02:30.320 --> 02:38.920
has a hosting, the user has a free hosting plan or something like this, and does as limit

02:38.920 --> 02:48.320
of system resources usage, but then after clicks that icon, any of these locked icons,

02:48.320 --> 02:57.440
sees a pop-up to start to have a proper hosting account. So there's a lot of interesting use

02:57.440 --> 03:06.280
cases here. But how this is done, so that's the interesting part, I would say. So there

03:06.280 --> 03:14.400
is these two keywords, this is user locked and is user restrict, and they are just, again,

03:14.400 --> 03:25.720
as I said, switcher, so on, off, true, false. And this can be set in the Coolwst XML, so

03:25.720 --> 03:30.840
it's very easy, just open Coolwst XML, you can even do it locally, you can try it, you

03:30.840 --> 03:37.520
can even lock it, and then call your brother or cousin that normally screws up all the

03:37.520 --> 03:42.600
formatting and tell him try to now screw up, and he cannot because all those formatting

03:42.600 --> 03:49.840
options are hidden. So it's very interesting, a joke to do. And how this looks like. So

03:49.840 --> 03:57.600
this is an example, you see, he cannot mark any text bold, even if he tries very hard.

03:57.600 --> 04:06.520
So it's an example, or he can, but you see, the italic option disappears. See, the difference

04:06.520 --> 04:15.600
between restricted and locked, these Coolwst options stated here. So I think it's pretty

04:15.600 --> 04:28.760
much it. Thanks, Brandon, for the presentation.
