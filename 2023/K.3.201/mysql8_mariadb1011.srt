0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.240
I'm going to talk today about MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.10.

2
0:00:10.240 --> 0:00:16.800
Original talk says 10.11, but I wanted to make sure we're sticking to the latest GA

3
0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:22.480
or stable version, so it had to go down a bit.

4
0:00:22.480 --> 0:00:32.080
And let me start by congratulating MariaDB team with MariaDB Corporation going public.

5
0:00:32.080 --> 0:00:39.880
In particular, Monty, congrats if driving two very impactful open source database companies

6
0:00:39.880 --> 0:00:40.880
to exit.

7
0:00:40.880 --> 0:00:43.600
That's quite an achievement.

8
0:00:43.600 --> 0:00:47.360
I think you people in the universe have that.

9
0:00:47.360 --> 0:00:54.720
That's one step on the road.

10
0:00:54.720 --> 0:00:56.880
So what are we going to talk about first?

11
0:00:56.880 --> 0:00:59.120
I think which we need to recognize.

12
0:00:59.120 --> 0:01:09.400
Where MariaDB and MySQL started from the same route, they have diverged substantially.

13
0:01:09.400 --> 0:01:14.080
So I think it was interesting then on the previous talk, Jean-FranÃ§ais was talking about

14
0:01:14.080 --> 0:01:15.080
upstream.

15
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:21.960
I was thinking, hey, does MariaDB really consider MySQL upstream at this point?

16
0:01:21.960 --> 0:01:25.160
Or not quite.

17
0:01:25.160 --> 0:01:26.160
Right in this case.

18
0:01:26.160 --> 0:01:34.680
I think there is enough diversity right with this is our ancestors, maybe monkeys for humans,

19
0:01:34.680 --> 0:01:38.360
something of this regard.

20
0:01:38.360 --> 0:01:49.000
Now in this case, I am trying to be fair the best way I can, which for me always means

21
0:01:49.000 --> 0:01:52.200
offense everybody equally.

22
0:01:52.200 --> 0:01:58.720
So if Monty is not screaming at me saying, you are fucking moron Peter, that is not how

23
0:01:58.720 --> 0:02:01.720
it is, then probably I'm not doing my job properly.

24
0:02:01.720 --> 0:02:11.480
No, no, no, but you see, yes, yes, yes.

25
0:02:11.480 --> 0:02:12.480
Of course, of course.

26
0:02:12.480 --> 0:02:15.720
You always do everything with loving your heart, right?

27
0:02:15.720 --> 0:02:19.880
And you don't use bad words as I do.

28
0:02:19.880 --> 0:02:22.600
That is wonderful.

29
0:02:22.600 --> 0:02:24.920
So let's talk about development model first.

30
0:02:24.920 --> 0:02:28.840
Obviously MySQL is developed by their Oracle corporations.

31
0:02:28.840 --> 0:02:33.160
We can see what the contributions are accepted, but I wouldn't say they are encouraged in

32
0:02:33.160 --> 0:02:36.000
the same way as MariaDB does.

33
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:40.000
And we also have open source as I would say like a drop ship open source.

34
0:02:40.000 --> 0:02:46.680
We have those release coming, but we do not really have a tree there over developers changes

35
0:02:46.680 --> 0:02:49.000
that happen as we can see.

36
0:02:49.000 --> 0:02:53.880
That I think can be particularly problematic, for example, for security bugs where it can

37
0:02:53.880 --> 0:03:01.560
be hard to track like what exactly change fixes that particular issue, right?

38
0:03:01.560 --> 0:03:09.000
Which is different from MariaDB, which has a server released by MariaDB Foundation.

39
0:03:09.000 --> 0:03:17.040
Though there is a lot of work for actual new features done by MariaDB corporations.

40
0:03:17.040 --> 0:03:23.680
Though foundations ensure what the contributions are encouraged and developers really done

41
0:03:23.680 --> 0:03:24.760
in the public, right?

42
0:03:24.760 --> 0:03:29.560
As I would say true open source project.

43
0:03:29.560 --> 0:03:35.280
One thing I wanted to point out, which I think is interesting is also changes from Oracle

44
0:03:35.280 --> 0:03:37.000
side, right?

45
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:44.040
For years I've been actually defender of Oracle in regards to saying, hey, you know, besides

46
0:03:44.040 --> 0:03:49.000
all this kind of stuff that Oracle is looking to kill MySQL, they have actually been doing

47
0:03:49.000 --> 0:03:55.760
a pretty good job in releasing majority features of open source and a property enterprise features

48
0:03:55.760 --> 0:04:01.560
have been kind of well isolated, abstracted through API and it was relatively easy for

49
0:04:01.560 --> 0:04:06.880
companies as well, especially like Percona to implement the equivalent.

50
0:04:06.880 --> 0:04:08.280
Now things have been changing.

51
0:04:08.280 --> 0:04:09.280
Last couple of years, right?

52
0:04:09.280 --> 0:04:12.480
We can see what's, everybody knows this guy?

53
0:04:12.480 --> 0:04:14.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
0:04:14.720 --> 0:04:25.480
Well, like we can see what Larry actually discovered, what MySQL exists in the last

55
0:04:25.480 --> 0:04:27.480
couple of years, right?

56
0:04:27.480 --> 0:04:33.640
And he only seems to care about MySQL as a heatwave because we all know heatwave is supposed

57
0:04:33.640 --> 0:04:37.080
to melt so no flake, right?

58
0:04:37.080 --> 0:04:42.920
And we can see a lot of focus getting on this snowflake development, which is sort of a

59
0:04:42.920 --> 0:04:48.600
cloud only and of course, you know, proprietary version of MySQL.

60
0:04:48.600 --> 0:04:52.120
So far it is only analytic extension, right?

61
0:04:52.120 --> 0:04:56.400
But I think it's all questions to us, hey, could there be some other critical features

62
0:04:56.400 --> 0:04:58.360
which will be only property, right?

63
0:04:58.360 --> 0:05:03.640
Maybe Oracle somewhere in the bellies developing something like transparent sharding for MySQL,

64
0:05:03.640 --> 0:05:06.120
maybe that is going to be proprietary first, right?

65
0:05:06.120 --> 0:05:12.400
So that is, I think, a question what a lot of people in MySQL community are asking.

66
0:05:12.400 --> 0:05:22.000
Now, with my, with MariaDB, I think what is interesting compared to like a MySQL, there

67
0:05:22.000 --> 0:05:30.000
are actually two companies, MariaDB, well, two entities probably better work, MariaDB

68
0:05:30.000 --> 0:05:33.040
Foundation and MariaDB Corporation, right?

69
0:05:33.040 --> 0:05:41.360
That is the latest mission, which I just grabbed a couple of days ago from MariaDB Foundation

70
0:05:41.360 --> 0:05:43.320
side, right?

71
0:05:43.320 --> 0:05:48.400
And I think that is a very good to understand relationship with those companies to understand

72
0:05:48.400 --> 0:05:52.960
this, right?

73
0:05:52.960 --> 0:06:00.720
Now if you think in this case is what MariaDBation is really at large focusing on serving MariaDB

74
0:06:00.720 --> 0:06:03.200
community, MariaDB ecosystem, right?

75
0:06:03.200 --> 0:06:09.240
It develops open source software around MySQL, where MariaDB Corporation that is now public

76
0:06:09.240 --> 0:06:16.080
company, right, which is providing the property solutions and commercializing MariaDB software,

77
0:06:16.080 --> 0:06:17.080
right?

78
0:06:17.080 --> 0:06:21.040
That is, I think, is the interest way, right?

79
0:06:21.040 --> 0:06:26.080
Now relationship sometimes can be a little bit complicated, though I would say there

80
0:06:26.080 --> 0:06:31.720
have been some more complicated installments in which I mentioned in my previous talks,

81
0:06:31.720 --> 0:06:32.720
right?

82
0:06:32.720 --> 0:06:39.160
And some of them have been made more clear, which I think is a great progress.

83
0:06:39.160 --> 0:06:44.560
So if you think about this, what is interesting is MariaDB Foundation has responsibility,

84
0:06:44.560 --> 0:06:48.200
kind of relatively narrow to the MariaDB server, right?

85
0:06:48.200 --> 0:06:54.120
And we can see what number of other components which are very valuable in MySQL ecosystem

86
0:06:54.120 --> 0:06:58.840
are owned by MariaDB Corporation, right?

87
0:06:58.840 --> 0:07:08.000
Not by the foundation and also a lot of development roadmap is driven by the Corporation.

88
0:07:08.000 --> 0:07:12.920
I also find it interesting what we see in MySQL, knowledge base, which is kind of built

89
0:07:12.920 --> 0:07:17.520
by community, but is hosted by MariaDB Corporation.

90
0:07:17.520 --> 0:07:24.640
I find not in a very good sense for like an open source software, there's also entanglement

91
0:07:24.640 --> 0:07:25.920
on the website level, right?

92
0:07:25.920 --> 0:07:36.000
So if I'm downloading MariaDB software from.org, right, then I am kind of redirected

93
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:40.080
next to the MariaDB Corporation knowledge base, right?

94
0:07:40.080 --> 0:07:46.480
And encouraged to fill out the lead which will go to their MariaDB Corporation, which

95
0:07:46.480 --> 0:07:48.360
is not totally transparent, right?

96
0:07:48.360 --> 0:07:53.840
I think that's kind of, I may be still looking like, oh, I am engaging with a nonprofit while

97
0:07:53.840 --> 0:08:00.440
actually I am giving my connections to somewhere else.

98
0:08:00.440 --> 0:08:07.400
Now, I wouldn't say though that that is completely unfair in this case because MariaDB does carry

99
0:08:07.400 --> 0:08:11.480
the largest wealth, the way to development and promoting MariaDB, right?

100
0:08:11.480 --> 0:08:22.640
And they do also get the largest rewards compared to other sponsors of MariaDB Foundation.

101
0:08:22.640 --> 0:08:28.360
Now let's look quickly at what is really open source between those versions.

102
0:08:28.360 --> 0:08:37.960
Now in MySQL, what we can see, it's a very clear open core platform and we have Maria

103
0:08:37.960 --> 0:08:41.160
MySQL community, right?

104
0:08:41.160 --> 0:08:48.360
And router, cluster, wherever, all that comes which comes in open source edition and there

105
0:08:48.360 --> 0:08:51.400
is also enterprise version.

106
0:08:51.400 --> 0:08:58.120
Plus, as I mentioned, the addition we have increasing focus on the cloud only solution

107
0:08:58.120 --> 0:09:01.680
as a heatwave.

108
0:09:01.680 --> 0:09:08.960
In terms of MariaDB, there are a lot more nuance in this case, right?

109
0:09:08.960 --> 0:09:14.600
Because there are certain things coming from MariaDB Foundation which are completely open

110
0:09:14.600 --> 0:09:16.560
source right now.

111
0:09:16.560 --> 0:09:26.680
The things in MariaDB Corporation space, they can be with a variety of licenses.

112
0:09:26.680 --> 0:09:31.960
Now if you look at the- Peter, let's correct your mistakes.

113
0:09:31.960 --> 0:09:32.960
Okay.

114
0:09:32.960 --> 0:09:37.040
In Mac scale, all the versions are open source.

115
0:09:37.040 --> 0:09:38.040
What's that?

116
0:09:38.040 --> 0:09:42.440
You need to say that all the versions in Mac scale is open source.

117
0:09:42.440 --> 0:09:43.440
Yes, yeah.

118
0:09:43.440 --> 0:09:45.440
The latest is BSL.

119
0:09:45.440 --> 0:09:47.320
Well, okay, yes.

120
0:09:47.320 --> 0:09:51.840
So the latest version of Mac scale is BSL.

121
0:09:51.840 --> 0:09:58.840
All the versions are open source, buggy, insecure and unsupported, right?

122
0:09:58.840 --> 0:09:59.840
What?

123
0:09:59.840 --> 0:10:00.840
Okay.

124
0:10:00.840 --> 0:10:24.120
Well, okay, well, you see- No, no.

125
0:10:24.120 --> 0:10:27.120
Okay.

126
0:10:27.120 --> 0:10:32.200
Not open source at all.

127
0:10:32.200 --> 0:10:33.200
Okay.

128
0:10:33.200 --> 0:10:36.200
That's fair.

129
0:10:36.200 --> 0:10:38.200
Okay.

130
0:10:38.200 --> 0:10:42.600
Let's move on, right?

131
0:10:42.600 --> 0:10:49.520
But I would actually check on the Mac scale in terms of how much changes there are.

132
0:10:49.520 --> 0:10:52.400
I did check a couple of years ago, right, to be honest, right?

133
0:10:52.400 --> 0:10:56.960
And the old versions at that time, they really converted to abandoned there.

134
0:10:56.960 --> 0:10:57.960
That changed, right?

135
0:10:57.960 --> 0:11:05.120
And there is actually, you know, they are being maintained beyond the BSL cutoff.

136
0:11:05.120 --> 0:11:07.120
Maybe not.

137
0:11:07.120 --> 0:11:08.720
Okay.

138
0:11:08.720 --> 0:11:09.720
The next thing, right?

139
0:11:09.720 --> 0:11:14.960
If you look at the MySQL enterprise is a super set of community, right?

140
0:11:14.960 --> 0:11:20.880
And I think in this case you have everything that runs in community runs on enterprise.

141
0:11:20.880 --> 0:11:27.400
If MariaDB, you can see MariaDB Enterprise is an extended subset of community, meaning

142
0:11:27.400 --> 0:11:31.880
there are some things in which exist in community which has not been included.

143
0:11:31.880 --> 0:11:35.520
Everything we do for enterprise is part of the community.

144
0:11:35.520 --> 0:11:40.760
I think there are two small features that we see enterprise we don't know.

145
0:11:40.760 --> 0:11:45.480
Well, I mean, so all the storage engines which exist in community are also supported under

146
0:11:45.480 --> 0:11:46.480
enterprise agreements?

147
0:11:46.480 --> 0:11:47.480
No.

148
0:11:47.480 --> 0:11:48.480
Well, that is what I'm saying, right?

149
0:11:48.480 --> 0:11:49.480
I think the first sentence.

150
0:11:49.480 --> 0:11:50.480
What?

151
0:11:50.480 --> 0:11:51.480
It is not a really extended subset.

152
0:11:51.480 --> 0:11:54.480
It has two features.

153
0:11:54.480 --> 0:11:57.480
Well, what about expand?

154
0:11:57.480 --> 0:12:02.480
It's not part of MariaDB Enterprise Server anymore.

155
0:12:02.480 --> 0:12:06.480
It's a different project.

156
0:12:06.480 --> 0:12:07.480
Oh, okay.

157
0:12:07.480 --> 0:12:08.480
Okay.

158
0:12:08.480 --> 0:12:09.480
Okay.

159
0:12:09.480 --> 0:12:10.480
Let me correct.

160
0:12:10.480 --> 0:12:17.080
So there is a cool feature available from MariaDB Corporation, but it's not part of

161
0:12:17.080 --> 0:12:19.080
MariaDB Enterprise product anymore.

162
0:12:19.080 --> 0:12:20.080
Okay.

163
0:12:20.080 --> 0:12:21.080
Sounds good.

164
0:12:21.080 --> 0:12:22.080
Okay.

165
0:12:22.080 --> 0:12:32.840
Let me move faster or we will need much more time if you have a wonderful and productive

166
0:12:32.840 --> 0:12:36.000
discussion with Manji.

167
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:38.000
Okay.

168
0:12:38.000 --> 0:12:44.320
So now in terms of cloud native, we have a finding new MySQL operator available from

169
0:12:44.320 --> 0:12:50.400
Oracle and both for MySQL and MariaDB, there is also a bunch of third-party operators available,

170
0:12:50.400 --> 0:12:54.880
including one for MySQL from Percona.

171
0:12:54.880 --> 0:12:59.000
If you look at from MariaDB Corporation, there is a lot of focus on SkySQL as a way to run

172
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:02.160
MariaDB in the clouds, right?

173
0:13:02.160 --> 0:13:06.320
Like there was MariaDB Corporation operator ones, right?

174
0:13:06.320 --> 0:13:13.600
But that is nowhere to be found, but there is an effort for MariaDB Foundation to have

175
0:13:13.600 --> 0:13:24.000
their operator created, though I couldn't find what if that's GA yet.

176
0:13:24.000 --> 0:13:25.500
Database as a service, right?

177
0:13:25.500 --> 0:13:33.920
Obviously, there is a lot of database as a service available for both databases standpoint,

178
0:13:33.920 --> 0:13:35.400
right?

179
0:13:35.400 --> 0:13:39.680
In this case, I think what is also interesting is what a lot of folks are relying on this

180
0:13:39.680 --> 0:13:42.000
sort of community versions right there.

181
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:49.720
You would say Oracle has MySQL enterprise with HitWave available on Oracle Cloud and

182
0:13:49.720 --> 0:13:56.160
now increasing some other clouds and also MariaDB has partnerships with other set of

183
0:13:56.160 --> 0:13:58.720
folks.

184
0:13:58.720 --> 0:14:05.040
In terms of analytics, we have a column store, right, in MariaDB ecosystem, right?

185
0:14:05.040 --> 0:14:11.240
In MySQL ecosystem, right, there is no really integrated open source solution.

186
0:14:11.240 --> 0:14:19.040
We have only cloud only HitWave as I mentioned.

187
0:14:19.040 --> 0:14:28.080
I also think there is a significantly different focus within MariaDB and MySQL, right?

188
0:14:28.080 --> 0:14:35.560
And I'm not going to read through all of that, but I think it's also interesting what the

189
0:14:35.560 --> 0:14:39.200
architecture approach, right, has been substantially different, right?

190
0:14:39.200 --> 0:14:45.840
If you look at MariaDB has been really having much more, you know, incremental iterative

191
0:14:45.840 --> 0:14:46.840
approach, right?

192
0:14:46.840 --> 0:14:54.920
In terms of MySQL, you can say a very big change with MySQL 8.

193
0:14:54.920 --> 0:15:02.160
A lot of things has been written, made not quite comparable.

194
0:15:02.160 --> 0:15:08.320
And also there's also a lot of focus in MySQL making it work better in the cloud, right,

195
0:15:08.320 --> 0:15:12.720
in how Oracle sees operating database in the cloud.

196
0:15:12.720 --> 0:15:18.360
Release frequency, that is something which I think is very interesting, which changed

197
0:15:18.360 --> 0:15:25.040
from the last year, right, where we can see MariaDB recently moved to even more frequent

198
0:15:25.040 --> 0:15:33.560
releases, right, which are with shorter maintenance cycle, right, as well as LTS releases every

199
0:15:33.560 --> 0:15:34.560
two years, right?

200
0:15:34.560 --> 0:15:42.200
So we can see what's starting with a February last year, the major MariaDB releases are

201
0:15:42.200 --> 0:15:48.000
coming out as quickly as minor MySQL releases, right?

202
0:15:48.000 --> 0:15:56.280
So I think that is a very interesting difference in this case, right?

203
0:15:56.280 --> 0:16:04.800
And as I mentioned, there is quite a few differences in this case, right?

204
0:16:04.800 --> 0:16:11.400
If MySQL 8 is kind of has this evergreen release, right, where you have a lot of features introduced

205
0:16:11.400 --> 0:16:15.160
in mind in Maria releases, also a lot of bugs, right?

206
0:16:15.160 --> 0:16:20.720
In particular, I think in the last few releases there have been some, you know, pretty nasty

207
0:16:20.720 --> 0:16:23.880
corruption bugs, which people did not appreciate.

208
0:16:23.880 --> 0:16:30.800
And also this concept, but now it's only a forward comparability, right, that once you

209
0:16:30.800 --> 0:16:37.280
move to the new MySQL 8 release, right, you are not going to be able to run a previous

210
0:16:37.280 --> 0:16:38.280
version, right?

211
0:16:38.280 --> 0:16:44.520
So if you really want a safe rollback, you need to dump and restore, which is not appreciated

212
0:16:44.520 --> 0:16:45.520
by many.

213
0:16:45.520 --> 0:16:59.520
So what you can do from, let's say, 10.5 to 10.10, right?

214
0:16:59.520 --> 0:17:03.760
I see.

215
0:17:03.760 --> 0:17:07.480
So you can upgrade.

216
0:17:07.480 --> 0:17:08.480
That is a good...

217
0:17:08.480 --> 0:17:16.920
I just made 5.7 MySQL to MariaDB 10.

218
0:17:16.920 --> 0:17:20.240
I think 10.10 also.

219
0:17:20.240 --> 0:17:21.240
Okay.

220
0:17:21.240 --> 0:17:27.600
Well, yeah, let's move quickly.

221
0:17:27.600 --> 0:17:28.880
Right?

222
0:17:28.880 --> 0:17:34.800
So some of the changes in MariaDB and MySQL, which I think is worth it.

223
0:17:34.800 --> 0:17:37.040
One is like a protocol.

224
0:17:37.040 --> 0:17:42.240
But MySQL hasn't pushed a lot on their new X protocol, while MariaDB has been making

225
0:17:42.240 --> 0:17:46.040
classical protocol better.

226
0:17:46.040 --> 0:17:51.280
We also have different interfaces support right there.

227
0:17:51.280 --> 0:17:53.280
Well, something else, Manji?

228
0:17:53.280 --> 0:17:57.280
You guys want to know how much do you see uses on X protocol?

229
0:17:57.280 --> 0:17:59.280
I've seen almost non-uses.

230
0:17:59.280 --> 0:18:00.280
Well, yeah.

231
0:18:00.280 --> 0:18:01.280
I hear using X protocol.

232
0:18:01.280 --> 0:18:02.280
It's used for group replication configuration.

233
0:18:02.280 --> 0:18:03.280
Yeah, but they're using it natively.

234
0:18:03.280 --> 0:18:10.280
If you manage group replication configuration, you use it.

235
0:18:10.280 --> 0:18:15.280
Sorry, I have to restart the file.

236
0:18:15.280 --> 0:18:19.280
Sorry, you need to lose slides for a minute.

237
0:18:19.280 --> 0:18:20.280
Oh, okay.

238
0:18:20.280 --> 0:18:21.280
Okay, yes.

239
0:18:21.280 --> 0:18:36.520
So the box needs to be...

240
0:18:36.520 --> 0:18:40.280
Well anyway, do guys have a good human generation?

241
0:18:40.280 --> 0:18:43.920
Yes, okay.

242
0:18:43.920 --> 0:18:48.000
So JSON, imagine JSON.

243
0:18:48.000 --> 0:18:51.000
Can you all imagine JSON?

244
0:18:51.000 --> 0:18:58.440
Yeah, so that is very significant difference also exists.

245
0:18:58.440 --> 0:19:05.880
In MySQL, they designed native JSON data type and have some pretty cool things like a partial

246
0:19:05.880 --> 0:19:08.640
updates.

247
0:19:08.640 --> 0:19:16.800
And also, I think from usability standpoint, JSON shortcuts, which makes things nicer and

248
0:19:16.800 --> 0:19:29.080
cleaner, with MariaDB, JSON is really stored as a text, where it has improved JSON partial

249
0:19:29.080 --> 0:19:31.440
speed significantly.

250
0:19:31.440 --> 0:19:37.280
And what is cool in the latest MySQL versions, it cut up a lot in JSON features in MySQL.

251
0:19:37.280 --> 0:19:43.280
I think two years ago, I could say, hey, MySQL is a lot further in terms of what it can do

252
0:19:43.280 --> 0:19:48.520
with JSON, most of that gap has been covered.

253
0:19:48.520 --> 0:19:52.640
Now imagine replication.

254
0:19:52.640 --> 0:20:02.480
Well, that is also, there are things substantially different, right?

255
0:20:02.480 --> 0:20:12.560
MySQL has built out a group replication, which gets a lot of focus in MySQL 8, specifically

256
0:20:12.560 --> 0:20:16.320
with MySQL in a DB cluster, right?

257
0:20:16.320 --> 0:20:21.280
You now have kind of cluster set, like how you can replicate between two clusters, a

258
0:20:21.280 --> 0:20:24.040
lot of focus on that.

259
0:20:24.040 --> 0:20:34.800
There MariaDB has been focusing on both supporting classical replication as well as Galera replication.

260
0:20:34.800 --> 0:20:42.240
And also, even if you look at classical replication, MariaDB, GTID, and MySQL, GTIDs are conceptually

261
0:20:42.240 --> 0:20:43.240
different, right?

262
0:20:43.240 --> 0:20:47.800
They both move to that versus binary logs alone.

263
0:20:47.800 --> 0:20:51.520
You should be able to stream it to you.

264
0:20:51.520 --> 0:20:54.960
Okay, well, you want me to try?

265
0:20:54.960 --> 0:20:55.960
Yes.

266
0:20:55.960 --> 0:20:56.960
One minute.

267
0:20:56.960 --> 0:20:57.960
One minute.

268
0:20:57.960 --> 0:20:58.960
One minute.

269
0:20:58.960 --> 0:20:59.960
Yeah.

270
0:20:59.960 --> 0:21:00.960
One minute.

271
0:21:00.960 --> 0:21:03.960
Minus one minute, right?

272
0:21:03.960 --> 0:21:04.960
Okay.

273
0:21:04.960 --> 0:21:05.960
What?

274
0:21:05.960 --> 0:21:07.960
You broke it.

275
0:21:07.960 --> 0:21:11.960
Now, it doesn't work at all.

276
0:21:11.960 --> 0:21:12.960
You see?

277
0:21:12.960 --> 0:21:13.960
You see?

278
0:21:13.960 --> 0:21:19.560
I think it's seen something, but it doesn't see.

279
0:21:19.560 --> 0:21:20.560
Okay.

280
0:21:20.560 --> 0:21:22.560
The good news is you can't blame me.

281
0:21:22.560 --> 0:21:23.560
What?

282
0:21:23.560 --> 0:21:26.720
Good news, you can't blame me.

283
0:21:26.720 --> 0:21:29.080
For change for once in a lifetime.

284
0:21:29.080 --> 0:21:33.000
Did you see the external display?

285
0:21:33.000 --> 0:21:35.960
Well, I think as you see, it's kind of blinks, right?

286
0:21:35.960 --> 0:21:42.120
What it gets, the external display, right, like, hello?

287
0:21:42.120 --> 0:21:43.120
You see?

288
0:21:43.120 --> 0:21:44.120
It gets.

289
0:21:44.120 --> 0:21:47.560
Yeah, that's what it says it's seen, external display.

290
0:21:47.560 --> 0:21:49.120
Well, that's lovely.

291
0:21:49.120 --> 0:21:56.680
Well, look, I mean, I have a couple of slides in minus two minutes, so let me just finish.

292
0:21:56.680 --> 0:22:00.280
And then you can, you know, troubleshoot it during the lunch, right?

293
0:22:00.280 --> 0:22:01.280
Sorry.

294
0:22:01.280 --> 0:22:02.280
Yeah.

295
0:22:02.280 --> 0:22:03.960
So, okay.

296
0:22:03.960 --> 0:22:06.320
Let's see what else.

297
0:22:06.320 --> 0:22:08.360
Couple of things which are different, right, significantly.

298
0:22:08.360 --> 0:22:13.840
I would say is, A, security is very different, right?

299
0:22:13.840 --> 0:22:19.880
There have been a lot of approach to making security better, both in my school and my

300
0:22:19.880 --> 0:22:21.560
ADB, but approach is essentially different.

301
0:22:21.560 --> 0:22:25.440
So if that is area you focus on and you immigrate in one way or another, make sure you give

302
0:22:25.440 --> 0:22:29.160
it separate special attention.

303
0:22:29.160 --> 0:22:33.640
Optimizer is another area, right, which things diverted specifically, right?

304
0:22:33.640 --> 0:22:40.200
So again, make sure to check your query plans, especially for complicated queries, and go

305
0:22:40.200 --> 0:22:46.160
in one way or another, right?

306
0:22:46.160 --> 0:22:53.520
Now I wanted to also pick up in the latest release a couple of unique MariaDB goodness,

307
0:22:53.520 --> 0:22:55.600
which speak to me in particular, right?

308
0:22:55.600 --> 0:22:59.560
One is I like your, your ID data type, right?

309
0:22:59.560 --> 0:23:03.440
Because all that kind of MySQL, post, well, you know what?

310
0:23:03.440 --> 0:23:07.520
You can actually do this and then you're going to store your ID efficiently.

311
0:23:07.520 --> 0:23:11.600
That is not a good way, you know, just provide the user convenient, your ID data type and

312
0:23:11.600 --> 0:23:12.600
functions, right?

313
0:23:12.600 --> 0:23:16.160
And so they don't have to deal with that shit.

314
0:23:16.160 --> 0:23:20.080
Log-free alter table for replication, I think it's also very cool, right?

315
0:23:20.080 --> 0:23:24.680
Pain, double for essentially time for alter table.

316
0:23:24.680 --> 0:23:30.520
That is, I think was log, log problem in I scroll, right?

317
0:23:30.520 --> 0:23:31.520
That's fixed.

318
0:23:31.520 --> 0:23:39.120
And I also like this concept of grant to public concept, which is being added in 10.11.

319
0:23:39.120 --> 0:23:41.560
Okay.

320
0:23:41.560 --> 0:23:45.440
And now I want you to imagine mountains.

321
0:23:45.440 --> 0:23:51.400
Well, because this slide was supposed to show what there is a nice conference, current whole

322
0:23:51.400 --> 0:23:55.880
bunch of databases called Per Corner Live coming in May.

323
0:23:55.880 --> 0:23:59.560
It will be in, in Denver, right?

324
0:23:59.560 --> 0:24:01.840
And copper papers is open.

325
0:24:01.840 --> 0:24:06.840
We want, you know, if you have something to talk, please submit.

326
0:24:06.840 --> 0:24:10.760
And also some other unique opportunity, right?

327
0:24:10.760 --> 0:24:13.320
Some of you are probably running MariaDB, right?

328
0:24:13.320 --> 0:24:14.320
Anyone?

329
0:24:14.320 --> 0:24:15.320
Anyone?

330
0:24:15.320 --> 0:24:16.320
Okay.

331
0:24:16.320 --> 0:24:19.680
Well, this is your opportunity not to just run MariaDB, but run for MariaDB.

332
0:24:19.680 --> 0:24:24.480
We will put together a like relay team for the Denver Marathon, right?

333
0:24:24.480 --> 0:24:30.280
Which will take place one day before Per Corner Live, right?

334
0:24:30.280 --> 0:24:35.920
And so if you guys want to attend and run about 8K as a part of MariaDB team, then let

335
0:24:35.920 --> 0:24:38.880
me know.

336
0:24:38.880 --> 0:24:43.360
That's all I have to say in this, you should imagine this slide, which says thanks to all

337
0:24:43.360 --> 0:24:59.240
of you to be in such a wonderful audience and come and listen to my talk.
