0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.560
Okay, thank you. It's great to be here for the first time. Really in person, I really

2
0:00:11.560 --> 0:00:12.560
feel...

3
0:00:12.560 --> 0:00:16.400
Yes, you're a regular feature actually.

4
0:00:16.400 --> 0:00:21.200
So far only online, it was so sad always, always in my small little room. So here I

5
0:00:21.200 --> 0:00:27.600
am. I want to talk about fusion again, like the last years. What I want to talk about

6
0:00:27.600 --> 0:00:32.240
here is about algebraic effects and types and what has changed in the last year in that

7
0:00:32.240 --> 0:00:37.160
respect in the fusion language.

8
0:00:37.160 --> 0:00:42.240
Short background to me, I did a lot on compilers and mostly in the Java area in the past for

9
0:00:42.240 --> 0:00:50.840
about 30 years and also did quite a bit on garbage collection. So I enjoyed the previous

10
0:00:50.840 --> 0:00:58.160
talks here quite a lot. But now to the fusion language, which is what I'm currently working

11
0:00:58.160 --> 0:01:05.240
on, the main idea behind the fusion language is that we see more and more language getting

12
0:01:05.240 --> 0:01:09.480
more and more overloaded with more and more features and concepts and new things being

13
0:01:09.480 --> 0:01:16.520
introduced while in fusion we try to reduce this to one single concept, which is a fusion

14
0:01:16.520 --> 0:01:23.320
feature. That's basically an abstraction for things like classes, methods, interfaces and

15
0:01:23.320 --> 0:01:26.400
so on.

16
0:01:26.400 --> 0:01:32.280
Instead of having the developer to choose what to write, whether to write a method or

17
0:01:32.280 --> 0:01:37.240
a class or so, have the compiler, have the implementation make these decisions, what

18
0:01:37.240 --> 0:01:42.760
we actually need to implement those features.

19
0:01:42.760 --> 0:01:46.680
And also we see that more and more systems become safety critical, so we need a simple

20
0:01:46.680 --> 0:01:51.480
language and we need tools to analyze that simple language to ensure the correctness.

21
0:01:51.480 --> 0:01:57.680
So that's what we keep in mind when we work on fusion. Fusion is on GitHub. I don't give

22
0:01:57.680 --> 0:02:03.240
any tutorial in the language also here in this talk. This is all online, so I will just

23
0:02:03.240 --> 0:02:08.420
basically throw you in the water and let you learn to swim bringing fusion code in this

24
0:02:08.420 --> 0:02:16.640
talk, but I hope, I think you will do fine. Fusion is backed by a small company, Tokiba.

25
0:02:16.640 --> 0:02:25.160
Now to this talk. No, before I forget, for those who only came for the fusion stickers,

26
0:02:25.160 --> 0:02:31.240
I have some here, so you can maybe give them around, whoever once can take one.

27
0:02:31.240 --> 0:02:36.760
So now what I want to talk about here is basically three points. I start with explaining what

28
0:02:36.760 --> 0:02:44.080
algebraic effects are and how they are implemented or how they are used in fusion. Then I want

29
0:02:44.080 --> 0:02:49.840
to talk a bit about types and how types can be used as first class features and type values

30
0:02:49.840 --> 0:02:55.240
can be used in fusion. And then I bring these two together because that brings a big advantage

31
0:02:55.240 --> 0:03:07.760
when working with algebraic effects. So what do we need effects for? Fusion, in fusion

32
0:03:07.760 --> 0:03:18.400
a feature is a pure function, so there is no side effects, no mutation of data by default.

33
0:03:18.400 --> 0:03:25.280
And algebraic effects are used in fusion now to model all the non-functional effects like

34
0:03:25.280 --> 0:03:33.920
state changes, I owe, any threat communication or mechanisms like exceptions. So let me first

35
0:03:33.920 --> 0:03:42.440
define what are algebraic effects. An algebraic effect is actually a set of operations. You

36
0:03:42.440 --> 0:03:49.800
could think of operations like reading data, so performing some I owe, getting the time

37
0:03:49.800 --> 0:03:55.320
or doing something like a panic, so causing an error in the application to stop, or logging

38
0:03:55.320 --> 0:04:04.720
some data somewhere. Typically these operations in an algebraic effect model some non-functional

39
0:04:04.720 --> 0:04:11.360
aspect that is kind of orthogonal to the actual computation of your function. These operations

40
0:04:11.360 --> 0:04:17.160
have basically two things that they can mainly do. They could either resume and produce a

41
0:04:17.160 --> 0:04:22.840
result like reading that is successful, or they can abort, which is like throwing an

42
0:04:22.840 --> 0:04:30.400
exception, you just get out of that, you don't get anything from this. And an effect can

43
0:04:30.400 --> 0:04:39.160
be implemented by different effect handlers. So one effect type could have different implementations.

44
0:04:39.160 --> 0:04:48.840
And to run code that uses an effect, this code has to be executed while a corresponding

45
0:04:48.840 --> 0:05:01.600
handler for that effect is installed. Now the effects allow static analysis of the code

46
0:05:01.600 --> 0:05:12.640
that we can analyze what effects any feature has. And we require that for all library code

47
0:05:12.640 --> 0:05:24.200
the full set of effects is documented in the signature of those features. So effects that

48
0:05:24.200 --> 0:05:30.960
are not presented are not affected are used that will cause a compile time error. I start

49
0:05:30.960 --> 0:05:39.560
with a small example of a hello world feature. We use this exclamation mark syntax to mark

50
0:05:39.560 --> 0:05:44.920
that this code actually uses an effect and the effect or requires an effect. And that

51
0:05:44.920 --> 0:05:51.480
is I ordered out in this case because the library function say requires that effect.

52
0:05:51.480 --> 0:05:58.200
And I run this code now, of course it prints hello world. And if I analyze the code for

53
0:05:58.200 --> 0:06:08.520
the effects that it has, I see that I ordered out is an effect required by this small example.

54
0:06:08.520 --> 0:06:16.880
Now I want to run the same code, the hello world hasn't changed, using my own handler.

55
0:06:16.880 --> 0:06:25.800
So I've defined a handler here which is a feature inherited thing from can print and

56
0:06:25.800 --> 0:06:34.240
it redefines the print operation to print to IO error instead and to replace the exclamation

57
0:06:34.240 --> 0:06:41.400
mark by many exclamation marks. And now to run this we need to first install this handler

58
0:06:41.400 --> 0:06:48.280
as the IO out handler. The IO out here is just a convenience function that installs

59
0:06:48.280 --> 0:06:56.560
the first handler and executes the code given in the lambda as a second argument. And when

60
0:06:56.560 --> 0:07:03.640
I run this now, of course, I see the print out is the modified string because we've replaced

61
0:07:03.640 --> 0:07:09.360
the exclamation mark here. And if I analyze this for effects, I now see this no longer

62
0:07:09.360 --> 0:07:17.080
depends on the IO out effect but the IO error because we have kind of diverted the code

63
0:07:17.080 --> 0:07:22.660
to depend on the other effect. We could also implement a handler that doesn't do anything

64
0:07:22.660 --> 0:07:32.240
then the hello world executed in that environment would not require any effect at all anymore.

65
0:07:32.240 --> 0:07:44.440
That much to effects now let me talk about types as first class features in fusion. To

66
0:07:44.440 --> 0:07:49.480
make it a bit easier for you to understand what's happening, I give first an example

67
0:07:49.480 --> 0:07:57.640
of generics in Java where I have a generic method here that takes an argument A of any

68
0:07:57.640 --> 0:08:10.060
generic type T and prints out the value. Doing that in fusion, we have type parameters which

69
0:08:10.060 --> 0:08:16.120
are actually at the same level as value parameters. So we have a function with two arguments,

70
0:08:16.120 --> 0:08:24.080
T which is a type and A which is a value of that type. And this is not just syntactic

71
0:08:24.080 --> 0:08:31.880
sugar that this looks the same but it's also internally the type parameters feature, our

72
0:08:31.880 --> 0:08:53.760
state features just as the arguments itself. Of course, we can now call this function with

73
0:08:53.760 --> 0:09:03.760
two different type parameters and two different value arguments and print these two values.

74
0:09:03.760 --> 0:09:11.840
That's pretty standard for generic for type parametric functions. Fusion uses a lot of

75
0:09:11.840 --> 0:09:19.680
type inferencing. So in such a case where the types are obvious from the arguments,

76
0:09:19.680 --> 0:09:25.400
they don't need to be given. So we have the rule that type parameters always have to precede

77
0:09:25.400 --> 0:09:32.200
the value arguments and they can be left out if they can be inferred. So the code can be

78
0:09:32.200 --> 0:09:34.080
written like this.

79
0:09:34.080 --> 0:09:41.520
The next we could constrain type parameters. So we could say in this case we want a type

80
0:09:41.520 --> 0:09:50.040
that must be numeric. And if you have such a constraint, we could use operations that

81
0:09:50.040 --> 0:09:57.160
are only provided by the type like the plus operator that is defined on numerics. And

82
0:09:57.160 --> 0:10:05.000
if you run this now, we can also output the double value. Still pretty standard for generics.

83
0:10:05.000 --> 0:10:10.080
But what we can also do is we can use the type parameter itself and call features that

84
0:10:10.080 --> 0:10:19.440
the type parameter provides. Every type provides its name. So we can run this code and print

85
0:10:19.440 --> 0:10:26.160
those names.

86
0:10:26.160 --> 0:10:32.000
And we can go even further with that. And I want to show you in an implementation of

87
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:42.280
a feature that calculates the sum of a list of some numeric elements. The implementation

88
0:10:42.280 --> 0:10:49.600
of that feature would distinguish the case of an empty list or a list consisting out

89
0:10:49.600 --> 0:10:56.240
of a head and a tail where we can recursively calculate the sum. The question now is what

90
0:10:56.240 --> 0:11:05.200
do we do in the case of the empty list? In languages like Java, we would have no way

91
0:11:05.200 --> 0:11:16.760
to produce any value here. What we can do is we can call a feature that is defined in

92
0:11:16.760 --> 0:11:25.980
the type numeric and redefined by all concrete implementations to provide the zero value

93
0:11:25.980 --> 0:11:33.680
for that actual numeric type. So numeric itself is defined as a feature with its corresponding

94
0:11:33.680 --> 0:11:43.160
type defining zero as an instance of exactly this type. And then something like an I32,

95
0:11:43.160 --> 0:11:54.080
a 32-bit integer, defines an implementation of type.zero to return the integer zero.

96
0:11:54.080 --> 0:12:02.600
And we can now use that function to print the sums of different lists here. And when

97
0:12:02.600 --> 0:12:10.040
I do this, we have a list of floating point values, a list of fractions. We have an empty

98
0:12:10.040 --> 0:12:13.480
list of floating point values and an empty list of fractions. So we get the corresponding

99
0:12:13.480 --> 0:12:28.640
zero values from the types of the corresponding types. So that much to types. And now coming

100
0:12:28.640 --> 0:12:38.280
back to effects, I want to use these types and type parameters to give names to effects

101
0:12:38.280 --> 0:12:49.120
or to reference user-defined effects. And I'll give you an example using a code that

102
0:12:49.120 --> 0:12:56.840
creates a linked ring. So a ring structure. To create a ring structure with references,

103
0:12:56.840 --> 0:13:02.760
you need mutation because at some point you have to close the ring. So that code require

104
0:13:02.760 --> 0:13:16.200
is mutable, is not easily pure. Then, so we will see that this depends on the mutate effect.

105
0:13:16.200 --> 0:13:28.120
And then we want to re-implement this or extend this to use local mutable state, local mutability

106
0:13:28.120 --> 0:13:38.280
to make this function pure. So I start by code to create a ring that uses the mutate

107
0:13:38.280 --> 0:13:42.520
effect. You don't need to understand the whole code. The important thing is that every element

108
0:13:42.520 --> 0:13:50.080
in that ring has a pointer to the next element. And there's a reference to the very last because

109
0:13:50.080 --> 0:13:55.440
if you extend the ring, you have to update the next of the last element in the ring to

110
0:13:55.440 --> 0:14:05.400
point to the newly added element in the ring. And here for next we create a mutable value

111
0:14:05.400 --> 0:14:11.520
which is done by a base library function mut, which use the mutate effect. And to update

112
0:14:11.520 --> 0:14:18.560
the next, we use this error operation to update that. Now we create, in a small demo, we create

113
0:14:18.560 --> 0:14:25.120
a ring with elements ABC. And then we run 10 times through the ring to print them. So

114
0:14:25.120 --> 0:14:30.480
we do that. We see that it circles around in that ring. But if you now analyze this

115
0:14:30.480 --> 0:14:39.400
for effects, what we see is that we have a mutate effect in, used by the code. There's

116
0:14:39.400 --> 0:14:43.600
lots of other effects as well, the out effect because we print something. But there's also

117
0:14:43.600 --> 0:14:48.520
error handling in the library code that shows up here. But what I'm interested in is here

118
0:14:48.520 --> 0:14:55.320
is now this has the mutate effect because the code mutates the next element while building

119
0:14:55.320 --> 0:15:06.280
the ring. And now we want to get rid of this mutability in the code. I know. I think I'll

120
0:15:06.280 --> 0:15:16.300
make it in five minutes. And the way to do this is we define a local instance of the

121
0:15:16.300 --> 0:15:23.440
mutate effect. And to do that, I first need a bit more space in the code. And I'll add

122
0:15:23.440 --> 0:15:37.160
a type parameter, M of type mutate, to the code here. And also pass this on calls, on

123
0:15:37.160 --> 0:15:47.400
types of ring used in here. And now when we create an instance of a mutable reference

124
0:15:47.400 --> 0:15:56.720
to the next element, instead we take the instance of the mutate effect M, which we got as a

125
0:15:56.720 --> 0:16:03.120
parameter here, from the current environment. The syntax we use in Fusion there is type.n,

126
0:16:03.120 --> 0:16:10.880
which is the effect from the environment, plus dot and the operation new create a new

127
0:16:10.880 --> 0:16:21.840
mutable variable. And now we can define our own mutate effect. Here mm is the local mutate

128
0:16:21.840 --> 0:16:29.800
effect defined here, which is just inheriting from mutate. And is nothing follows after

129
0:16:29.800 --> 0:16:35.840
the is, so it doesn't do anything special. It is just a new subfeature inheriting from

130
0:16:35.840 --> 0:16:42.320
mutate. So it basically only has the purpose of giving a new name to this is my local mutate

131
0:16:42.320 --> 0:16:56.960
here. And now we can pass this sub instance of mutate, or the subtype of mutate, to the

132
0:16:56.960 --> 0:17:04.320
ring here, which means that all the mutable values that are created are created locally

133
0:17:04.320 --> 0:17:19.240
to the mm to our own mutate effect. Now we still have to create this effect and execute

134
0:17:19.240 --> 0:17:23.240
the code within the context of this effect. And this happens in the bottom here. So we

135
0:17:23.240 --> 0:17:31.920
create an instance of mm and use it to execute the demo code. And that means that the m.f

136
0:17:31.920 --> 0:17:39.680
nf call here will then take the instance of mm from the current environment to create

137
0:17:39.680 --> 0:17:47.080
the new mutable value. And when we run the demo, the same output. If we analyze it for

138
0:17:47.080 --> 0:17:52.680
effects now, we see it's the same effect apart from the mutate is gone, because the mutate

139
0:17:52.680 --> 0:18:01.120
is completely local here. So we can create code that locally, to perform some calculation,

140
0:18:01.120 --> 0:18:08.400
creates mutable data and mutates data structures. But the result is a pure function anyway,

141
0:18:08.400 --> 0:18:17.320
because the mutation is only done locally. So I'm coming to the end. Fusion status is

142
0:18:17.320 --> 0:18:23.840
still under-developing. It's a very experimental language, but the language definition is slowly

143
0:18:23.840 --> 0:18:30.720
getting more stable. There's still a lot of work on the base library that is ongoing.

144
0:18:30.720 --> 0:18:37.280
There are currently, the current implementation has two backends. One is a very slow interpreter

145
0:18:37.280 --> 0:18:45.800
running on a JVM. And the other is a C backend, which also used the BMD-Mviser garbage collector,

146
0:18:45.800 --> 0:18:52.040
which we just learned about as a garbage collector right now. But I would like to have a precise

147
0:18:52.040 --> 0:18:59.080
garbage collector and add a lot there as well. And basic analysis tools, like you've seen

148
0:18:59.080 --> 0:19:07.440
for the effects here, are available. And yes, those who remember Ellie might wonder who's

149
0:19:07.440 --> 0:19:16.560
disturbing me now while I'm working on this is Felix. That's it. That's coming to the

150
0:19:16.560 --> 0:19:25.920
end. So maybe one more sentence. I hope I could show you that algebraic effects and

151
0:19:25.920 --> 0:19:31.240
types as first-class features are something that complements one another pretty well.

152
0:19:31.240 --> 0:19:46.920
And it helps to create code, then encapsulates non-functional effects. And yes, it makes

153
0:19:46.920 --> 0:19:52.680
it possible to work with this and work even with code that is not pure, but to manage

154
0:19:52.680 --> 0:20:01.360
this in a nice way. You find some links here to resources related to Fusion. We're happy

155
0:20:01.360 --> 0:20:07.800
for everyone who gets involved. Please have a look. Join us. We have a small team currently

156
0:20:07.800 --> 0:20:23.880
from three working on this. We can, there should be more. Thank you very much. Can I

157
0:20:23.880 --> 0:20:25.560
pick? Yeah. Thank you.

158
0:20:25.560 --> 0:20:39.920
So earlier you said that a particular type can implement numeric. Is that a word terminology

159
0:20:39.920 --> 0:20:42.920
you use, but is it a numeric interface? And then you were able to say A plus B. If you

160
0:20:42.920 --> 0:20:43.920
didn't say that it's a numeric, what would happen if you tried to compile that program?

161
0:20:43.920 --> 0:20:49.920
The question was if a particular type would not implement numeric and you would use the

162
0:20:49.920 --> 0:20:54.400
plus in there, what would happen then? You would get a compile-time error. It's completely

163
0:20:54.400 --> 0:21:00.000
strict typing. So if you call a function that requires a numeric type parameter and you

164
0:21:00.000 --> 0:21:05.120
call it with, say, a string, well, a string happens to have a plus, but not the numeric

165
0:21:05.120 --> 0:21:12.840
plus, you will get an error that type, the actual type parameter is not compatible to

166
0:21:12.840 --> 0:21:16.760
the type constraint in the code features. So that will not be excellent.

167
0:21:16.760 --> 0:21:26.920
And the same example you were converting the value to string in order to print it. Is the

168
0:21:26.920 --> 0:21:27.920
string operation implied to be present for every value?

169
0:21:27.920 --> 0:21:35.640
There's a two-string operation in our any, which is the parent of any feature. So a two-string

170
0:21:35.640 --> 0:21:41.720
is always available, yes. It's not very helpful if you don't define anything because you just

171
0:21:41.720 --> 0:21:48.360
have to do it. I'm contributing to the language code name,

172
0:21:48.360 --> 0:21:55.080
which also have an effect types and I have one for people who are generic code. One problem

173
0:21:55.080 --> 0:22:00.840
that I've seen in combining these features is that when you have generic code, you often

174
0:22:00.840 --> 0:22:08.040
don't, you can create instantiations when you trigger different effects. So how do you

175
0:22:08.040 --> 0:22:17.400
approach this kind of syntactically or even simultaneously the language?

176
0:22:17.400 --> 0:22:23.720
The question was that actual code can actually trigger all sorts of different actual effects

177
0:22:23.720 --> 0:22:29.360
at runtime. So you could have, one example I think of, you could have a function converting

178
0:22:29.360 --> 0:22:35.400
in an object to a string that maybe performs some logging and some other code printing

179
0:22:35.400 --> 0:22:42.560
that value would not expect that. My answer to that is that must be part of the static

180
0:22:42.560 --> 0:22:50.200
analysis. We need to analyze the whole application and see what is happening there. Library functions

181
0:22:50.200 --> 0:22:56.400
can do this to a certain extent, but they cannot predict if you have a dynamic value

182
0:22:56.400 --> 0:23:01.200
coming in, what the actual type will be. So we need a whole program analysis in the end

183
0:23:01.200 --> 0:23:08.200
there. Do we have time for one more? We will.

184
0:23:31.200 --> 0:23:38.200
So the question was, in Haskell you have multiple

185
0:24:01.200 --> 0:24:05.120
monads which have a similar role like the effects, but you have them always explicitly,

186
0:24:05.120 --> 0:24:11.200
you have to carry them around and mark them. The answer is here, this is actually, it's

187
0:24:11.200 --> 0:24:17.880
on purpose. We don't want to have the hassle of wrapping everything into a monad and carrying

188
0:24:17.880 --> 0:24:24.960
it around all the time. So the idea is to get rid of this as much as possible without

189
0:24:24.960 --> 0:24:33.160
losing the information you get from the effects. Thank you for all the questions.
