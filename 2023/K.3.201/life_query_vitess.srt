0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Hello everyone.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:13.360
Alright, thank you.

3
0:00:13.360 --> 0:00:14.640
So I am Harshit Gangal.

4
0:00:14.640 --> 0:00:20.800
I work for PlanetScale and I am a maintainer of VITAS and today I am going to talk about

5
0:00:20.800 --> 0:00:22.000
life of a query.

6
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:23.000
Why not?

7
0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:27.080
Because I work in query serving team in VITAS.

8
0:00:27.080 --> 0:00:29.240
So what is VITAS basically?

9
0:00:29.240 --> 0:00:35.040
VITAS is nothing but it is used to scale out your MySQL and it also manages your MySQL

10
0:00:35.040 --> 0:00:36.040
for you.

11
0:00:36.040 --> 0:00:43.800
It is a CNCF gadget project and it is open source with Apache license 2.0.

12
0:00:43.800 --> 0:00:49.040
So this is the architecture of VITAS which is basically there are so many components

13
0:00:49.040 --> 0:00:53.680
but today we will just focus on few of them which is one is VT gate where your application

14
0:00:53.680 --> 0:00:58.920
connects to and then we have VT tablet where once the application connects to VT gate then

15
0:00:58.920 --> 0:01:02.920
the queries are sent over there and then you have the MySQL where actually your data are

16
0:01:02.920 --> 0:01:06.320
getting stored.

17
0:01:06.320 --> 0:01:10.640
Let us talk about few terminologies which I will be using across my presentation which

18
0:01:10.640 --> 0:01:11.640
is one is Keyspace.

19
0:01:11.640 --> 0:01:17.040
Keyspace is a logical representation of a database and it is basically a collection

20
0:01:17.040 --> 0:01:19.040
of your physical databases.

21
0:01:19.040 --> 0:01:28.080
Shard, it is basically a subset of your data which resides in a Keyspace and there is some

22
0:01:28.080 --> 0:01:29.080
term called Windex.

23
0:01:29.080 --> 0:01:36.960
Windex is similar to your MySQL indexes which is basically it is maintained by the VITAS

24
0:01:36.960 --> 0:01:41.440
and there is a thing called primary Windexes which means it will decide where your row

25
0:01:41.440 --> 0:01:45.040
actually live in a particular shard or in particular table.

26
0:01:45.040 --> 0:01:50.560
So once your query comes in then it decides like okay this row while inserting where it

27
0:01:50.560 --> 0:01:56.600
should actually which shard it should actually go to.

28
0:01:56.600 --> 0:02:00.720
So let us take some query right then we will go further.

29
0:02:00.720 --> 0:02:06.040
So let us say we have two tables customer and order table and what we want to do is

30
0:02:06.040 --> 0:02:13.480
we want to find a customer who has at least a spend of 1000 rupees, 1000 bucks basically

31
0:02:13.480 --> 0:02:15.760
in their whole order history.

32
0:02:15.760 --> 0:02:20.280
So we have to take two tables we take a join and do grouping on them and take a filter

33
0:02:20.280 --> 0:02:23.960
on top of it.

34
0:02:23.960 --> 0:02:28.880
So first thing first, so now the clients want to send a query to you how they will do it.

35
0:02:28.880 --> 0:02:35.240
So first the client has to connect to something called VIT gates and so they can use MySQL

36
0:02:35.240 --> 0:02:36.240
protocol.

37
0:02:36.240 --> 0:02:42.600
You have your vanilla, you have all the MySQL drivers like in different languages you have

38
0:02:42.600 --> 0:02:47.640
and you can use the already available MySQL driver to connect directly to VIT gate.

39
0:02:47.640 --> 0:02:51.940
VIT gate supports the MySQL protocol so you do not have to do anything on that front.

40
0:02:51.940 --> 0:02:59.720
But it also supports GRPC and it was supported earlier before we implemented the MySQL protocol

41
0:02:59.720 --> 0:03:03.920
but it still stays here for its own benefits.

42
0:03:03.920 --> 0:03:09.760
And the reason is like in MySQL protocol once you connect it is like your session is tied

43
0:03:09.760 --> 0:03:13.440
which means if you open a transaction you have to commit transaction using that.

44
0:03:13.440 --> 0:03:18.640
But in GRPC what the initial benefit you get is you can connect to any VIT gate and you

45
0:03:18.640 --> 0:03:22.200
start a transaction over there and then you can connect to any other VIT gate and you

46
0:03:22.200 --> 0:03:26.600
can commit a transaction using that VIT gate.

47
0:03:26.600 --> 0:03:30.280
So let's talk about the different phases that we have to go through.

48
0:03:30.280 --> 0:03:35.000
Once the query is now received by the VIT gate it has to go through parsing, rewriting,

49
0:03:35.000 --> 0:03:39.200
planning and execution and we'll talk in details about each of the phases but this

50
0:03:39.200 --> 0:03:44.120
is what the VIT gate does once it receives the query on its end.

51
0:03:44.120 --> 0:03:50.600
So in the parsing phase now you receive the query now basically it will parse it to know

52
0:03:50.600 --> 0:03:54.680
the whether the operaries syntactically correct or not and once it is syntactically correct

53
0:03:54.680 --> 0:03:57.560
then it construct the abstract syntax free output of it.

54
0:03:57.560 --> 0:04:01.680
So it will have the select expression from clauses, group by and the having for the query

55
0:04:01.680 --> 0:04:05.480
we mentioned before.

56
0:04:05.480 --> 0:04:10.920
Now once it's parsed it goes into the rewriting phase and it's very important to have this

57
0:04:10.920 --> 0:04:15.920
rewriting phase because we are trying to mimic a thing like as a single data store though

58
0:04:15.920 --> 0:04:21.560
your data is distributed across multiple shards and this rewriting phase what we try to do

59
0:04:21.560 --> 0:04:28.160
is basically we first try to see oh is there any literals is anything which you can parameterize.

60
0:04:28.160 --> 0:04:32.920
So once we are done with the planning phase we don't have to plan again and again similar

61
0:04:32.920 --> 0:04:34.360
kind of query.

62
0:04:34.360 --> 0:04:39.320
So what we do is we say okay here's I see 1000 but I don't need to plan specifically

63
0:04:39.320 --> 0:04:44.440
for 1000 so I just make it a parameter and then I plan for this kind of query rather

64
0:04:44.440 --> 0:04:48.960
than planning with the 1000.

65
0:04:48.960 --> 0:04:52.880
The other thing we do is we do some replacement functions.

66
0:04:52.880 --> 0:04:57.400
So like if you want to get last insert ID you cannot just send it to any MySQL and

67
0:04:57.400 --> 0:04:58.780
get a last insert ID.

68
0:04:58.780 --> 0:05:04.400
So we do a session management at the VTGet level where for each session we have to know

69
0:05:04.400 --> 0:05:09.300
what was the last insert ID inserted so you cannot send directly so we need rewriting

70
0:05:09.300 --> 0:05:13.040
phase for these kind of functions they are multiple but I just talking about one of them

71
0:05:13.040 --> 0:05:18.400
which is last insert ID so you have to do it at the VTGet level so then you know then

72
0:05:18.400 --> 0:05:24.960
you are replacing that function with a value and you know what that value is for that session.

73
0:05:24.960 --> 0:05:30.960
And the third is you might have to add another SQL node like after you construct the AST

74
0:05:30.960 --> 0:05:36.880
so this is like if on the session you said my I cannot select more than 100 rows so in

75
0:05:36.880 --> 0:05:41.440
the after AST we have in the rewriting phase we will add a limit clause as well so the

76
0:05:41.440 --> 0:05:47.200
planning happens with the limit in place in it.

77
0:05:47.200 --> 0:05:53.080
So before so after rewriting and the AST generation before we go into the planning the planner

78
0:05:53.080 --> 0:05:57.080
needs some additional information which is it should know what are the key spaces that

79
0:05:57.080 --> 0:06:05.040
exist and what are the shard that the key space map to and in the key spaces what are

80
0:06:05.040 --> 0:06:10.520
the tables that exist and what is the primary way what are the in Windexes that you use

81
0:06:10.520 --> 0:06:17.080
for those tables and those these information is basically cached in the VTGate and you

82
0:06:17.080 --> 0:06:21.440
have an event watcher which watches and this information comes from actually we have something

83
0:06:21.440 --> 0:06:27.480
called topo server which is zookeeper HCD sim which is this metadata kind of information

84
0:06:27.480 --> 0:06:33.840
stored and let us see what the sharding information looks like that we get from that zookeeper

85
0:06:33.840 --> 0:06:38.560
so what we call is called V schema and here it is saying that there is one thing called

86
0:06:38.560 --> 0:06:44.840
commerce and it sharded this is the Windex that exists and these are the two tables customer

87
0:06:44.840 --> 0:06:52.900
and the order table which use and they uses the CID column and they use this Windex function

88
0:06:52.900 --> 0:06:59.160
to shard their table.

89
0:06:59.160 --> 0:07:06.160
So now the VTGate knows about everything that now it can go into the planning phase and

90
0:07:06.160 --> 0:07:12.680
the first thing that it does is does the semantic analysis which is it does basically scoping

91
0:07:12.680 --> 0:07:18.020
binding and typing which is like it is validating not validated your syntactic thing before

92
0:07:18.020 --> 0:07:21.920
and now it is trying to validate whether you are using the right columns in the right places

93
0:07:21.920 --> 0:07:26.320
or not whether they are actually scoped correctly or not is the visibility correct or not for

94
0:07:26.320 --> 0:07:31.720
those the operations the operations you are using and then once it validates that then

95
0:07:31.720 --> 0:07:36.360
it goes into the binding phase where it binds those columns to the table that it belongs

96
0:07:36.360 --> 0:07:41.520
to and then it also does the typing which means it try to understand that okay once

97
0:07:41.520 --> 0:07:47.160
the results come back we know that what type it will be of.

98
0:07:47.160 --> 0:07:52.240
The second is once the semantic analysis happens then your AST is converted into an operator

99
0:07:52.240 --> 0:07:58.800
tree which is basically it is basically a logical operator like you have joints and

100
0:07:58.800 --> 0:08:03.200
then you have tables and stuff so it convert into those logical operators and then once

101
0:08:03.200 --> 0:08:08.640
those logical operator are converted it then goes into the optimization phase.

102
0:08:08.640 --> 0:08:14.720
So in the optimization phase we basically make a decision that how the plan should look

103
0:08:14.720 --> 0:08:21.080
like and in the innovators basically what we do is we get the sequel and ultimately

104
0:08:21.080 --> 0:08:25.120
after the planning phase we will get another sequel because the data does not reside on

105
0:08:25.120 --> 0:08:30.760
the VT gate it resides on the MySQL and we want to optimize on the way that we should

106
0:08:30.760 --> 0:08:35.040
get less and less information back on the VT gate to process your data.

107
0:08:35.040 --> 0:08:42.040
So we try to push as much as down to the query to the MySQL so that that can resolve much

108
0:08:42.040 --> 0:08:44.920
faster for us than we do it at the VT gate.

109
0:08:44.920 --> 0:08:51.400
So in the optimization phase basically after the optimization completes we call something

110
0:08:51.400 --> 0:08:58.160
like routes which tell us that okay this query will go to which all shards so that is what

111
0:08:58.160 --> 0:09:05.840
the ultimate step becomes and that is where we call it as a physical operator and then

112
0:09:05.840 --> 0:09:13.480
once we have the physical operators we transform the plan into an execution plan and the execution

113
0:09:13.480 --> 0:09:17.400
plan is nothing but a collection of engine primitives that we call.

114
0:09:17.400 --> 0:09:22.320
So let us look at how the plan looks like or how the execution plan looks like.

115
0:09:22.320 --> 0:09:29.880
So if both the tables which I showed in the V schema were using same sharding key, sharding

116
0:09:29.880 --> 0:09:35.080
function so that is why we were able to basically make it as a single route which is telling

117
0:09:35.080 --> 0:09:41.880
you that okay just go scatter to all the shards and just gather the result at the VT gate

118
0:09:41.880 --> 0:09:46.120
level and send it back to the user.

119
0:09:46.120 --> 0:09:52.880
But if both the tables the customer table and the order table were using some different

120
0:09:52.880 --> 0:09:58.160
sharding functions then you cannot merge it like that then it says basically it will look

121
0:09:58.160 --> 0:10:02.720
something like that like you will have now because it gets very complex enough to show

122
0:10:02.720 --> 0:10:07.620
everything over here so I am just showing that there will be two routes that will happen

123
0:10:07.620 --> 0:10:11.780
and then ultimately the join will also happen at the VT gate level sorting and projecting

124
0:10:11.780 --> 0:10:17.480
and aggregation and then finally the filtering based on how much customers have spent those

125
0:10:17.480 --> 0:10:23.200
thousand bucks so everything happens on the VT gate.

126
0:10:23.200 --> 0:10:27.120
Let's just look at the two routes that I showed on the left.

127
0:10:27.120 --> 0:10:31.600
So first one will do is basically doing a scatter and it's trying to do on the order

128
0:10:31.600 --> 0:10:39.000
table that okay give me for all the customer IDs what is the spend they have done and then

129
0:10:39.000 --> 0:10:44.160
on the right hand side we need the customer email so for every customer ID I need to get

130
0:10:44.160 --> 0:10:49.880
their email IDs and because the customer ID was the sharding key the primary index for

131
0:10:49.880 --> 0:10:56.440
that table we are able to send the second query as a only to a specific shard we don't

132
0:10:56.440 --> 0:11:04.280
have to do again go to all the shards.

133
0:11:04.280 --> 0:11:07.440
So what all steps happen in the execution?

134
0:11:07.440 --> 0:11:12.880
So first thing is once we get the route we resolve it using those indexes and so that

135
0:11:12.880 --> 0:11:16.600
it can go to the specific correct shard.

136
0:11:16.600 --> 0:11:20.840
Another is then basically then we take it decide okay now we know which shard we have

137
0:11:20.840 --> 0:11:25.080
to go to then it then it will also decide okay this is a query that we have to send

138
0:11:25.080 --> 0:11:30.920
it to something that we call the VT tablets which basically in the shard we have VT tablets

139
0:11:30.920 --> 0:11:37.480
in MySQL so it sent it to the VT tablet and then it once you receive the result back you

140
0:11:37.480 --> 0:11:44.720
gather the information but sometimes you also have to do transaction so if transaction is

141
0:11:44.720 --> 0:11:49.080
needed then the VT gate will also tell VT tablets go and also open the transaction when

142
0:11:49.080 --> 0:11:56.440
you execute this query and then the session the transactions will be managed by the VT

143
0:11:56.440 --> 0:12:00.080
gate that will know in which shard what is the transaction being opened so that when

144
0:12:00.080 --> 0:12:03.360
you do the commit it knows which all shard it has to send the commit information as well

145
0:12:03.360 --> 0:12:06.680
too.

146
0:12:06.680 --> 0:12:12.000
And the third and the last thing that execution also handles is basically if you have a select

147
0:12:12.000 --> 0:12:15.840
query and you want to read it on the replicas then it also does the load balancing for you

148
0:12:15.840 --> 0:12:24.880
so it doesn't overload a specific a single replica.

149
0:12:24.880 --> 0:12:33.560
And yeah right so now the query is been sent to VT tablets and now the VT job is to basically

150
0:12:33.560 --> 0:12:37.600
get the result back to the VT gate so what are the things that goes in the VT tablet

151
0:12:37.600 --> 0:12:43.040
it's exactly similar thing that goes in the VT tablets as well but what are different

152
0:12:43.040 --> 0:12:48.120
reasons so first thing is VT gate has some view of the VT tablet of what the state is

153
0:12:48.120 --> 0:12:51.960
but the first thing that the once the query received by the VT tablet it does this okay

154
0:12:51.960 --> 0:12:56.520
let me validate whether that's current am I able to serve this query or not if any view

155
0:12:56.520 --> 0:13:03.760
has changed before after sending the query and before it reads the VT tablet so it validates

156
0:13:03.760 --> 0:13:09.200
if everything is okay then let's go and do the parsing so it will parse the query and

157
0:13:09.200 --> 0:13:15.460
the reason is it has to parse the queries because VT tablet has its checks and balances

158
0:13:15.460 --> 0:13:22.320
over here where it tries to put some limitation like it says that don't overload the MySQL

159
0:13:22.320 --> 0:13:27.520
resource so it will basically add its own limits on the query so that it doesn't overload

160
0:13:27.520 --> 0:13:33.280
your MySQL that's that you can configure and do things and then it goes into the planning

161
0:13:33.280 --> 0:13:37.880
phase and in the planning field it basically tries to see whether did you have did you

162
0:13:37.880 --> 0:13:43.600
have put any query rules which means like any bad query if you put like okay somebody

163
0:13:43.600 --> 0:13:48.440
does select star and without a where condition and stuff so it should it should it basically

164
0:13:48.440 --> 0:13:52.720
says okay this query cannot be executed because it's a bad query so those kind of query rules

165
0:13:52.720 --> 0:13:57.880
you can put and and and the second and another thing that we check in in the planning phase

166
0:13:57.880 --> 0:14:01.880
is basically it will say okay this is the user that send this query but is the user

167
0:14:01.880 --> 0:14:06.800
allowed to even access that tables or not so if if it's not allowed then we throw the

168
0:14:06.800 --> 0:14:13.680
error back after the planning phase also we detail it does this again and all these are

169
0:14:13.680 --> 0:14:18.400
there to just not to load a MySQL so another thing that it does is query consolidation

170
0:14:18.400 --> 0:14:23.680
which is basically it's it's it checks whether any similar same query or some exact same

171
0:14:23.680 --> 0:14:28.680
query is running on the MySQL or not if it's already running then it put it just waits

172
0:14:28.680 --> 0:14:32.760
for that query to return the result and all the threads which are waiting for the same

173
0:14:32.760 --> 0:14:37.840
query will get the result and it will return back so only one query ultimately gets executed

174
0:14:37.840 --> 0:14:43.520
on the MySQL and not all the queries get executed with the same exact same same query

175
0:14:43.520 --> 0:14:49.600
yes so once it thinks okay nothing can be done like it it has to finally send it to

176
0:14:49.600 --> 0:14:55.760
MySQL then it will use the one of the connection from the connection pool to send the query

177
0:14:55.760 --> 0:15:00.120
to MySQL and once the results are written back it will send it to vtgate if it has to

178
0:15:00.120 --> 0:15:10.040
do some operations will do it and finally the client will receive the query so yeah

179
0:15:10.040 --> 0:15:14.160
so that that's what the life of queries but then there are some customized operations

180
0:15:14.160 --> 0:15:19.720
which also affect your query path and which is like when there's a plan maintenance going

181
0:15:19.720 --> 0:15:27.480
like you are promoting one replica to primary for some reason and so and the other is basically

182
0:15:27.480 --> 0:15:32.600
if you are splitting your data like you have some n shards and you want to go to 2n shards

183
0:15:32.600 --> 0:15:40.440
or n plus 1 shards or such thing like that so while doing those operations what vt tablet

184
0:15:40.440 --> 0:15:46.280
does is it notifies to topo that some operation is going vtgate understands it so it doesn't

185
0:15:46.280 --> 0:15:52.200
send query to the vt tablet it basically buffers for certain duration and once everything comes

186
0:15:52.200 --> 0:15:57.960
back right then it the queries start going to the vt tablet or it times out and vtgate

187
0:15:57.960 --> 0:16:10.840
does the time out from itself rather than sending it down so yeah thank you questions

188
0:16:10.840 --> 0:16:31.600
so currently we we don't do cross shard transactions we do it but in the best effort way but it's

189
0:16:31.600 --> 0:16:35.760
currently on the application to know that they are doing cross shard transactions but

190
0:16:35.760 --> 0:16:42.760
we allow it but the application should know that they are going cross shard.

191
0:16:42.760 --> 0:16:46.120
Yes.

192
0:16:46.120 --> 0:17:05.720
So join I already showed in how we have the two routes and then from one we get the two

193
0:17:05.720 --> 0:17:20.800
routes and then the other one this is join so we have hash joins available but then it

194
0:17:20.800 --> 0:17:27.280
will consume your memory and other yes otherwise it's yes it's like from one you will get the

195
0:17:27.280 --> 0:17:47.960
result and then you send it to the other one so it's just sequential yes

196
0:17:47.960 --> 0:17:53.480
aggregation happens at the vtgate level we he has a sorting layer so before aggregation

197
0:17:53.480 --> 0:17:59.040
we have to sort yes that's what it was there in the diagram as well that after join there

198
0:17:59.040 --> 0:18:03.920
was sort layer because you have to sort so we have a in-memory sort so that there are

199
0:18:03.920 --> 0:18:11.280
multiple against sort based on what we can do the best so there's a merge sort also and

200
0:18:11.280 --> 0:18:17.400
then you have a complete sort as well based on what can we do best and then sorting then

201
0:18:17.400 --> 0:18:35.600
it goes to the aggregation what do you make certain operation yes yes so yes so that's

202
0:18:35.600 --> 0:18:40.800
why we said we try to push as much as to my sequel so we actually push the sort as well

203
0:18:40.800 --> 0:18:44.760
to my sequel if possible for the most sort but if you do it in the memory then we still

204
0:18:44.760 --> 0:18:50.120
sorted so that like we can it depends whether we can push it down or not if you are able

205
0:18:50.120 --> 0:19:12.200
to push it down we push as much as to the my sequel yes thank you all right I think

206
0:19:12.200 --> 0:19:15.800
you have nothing thank you thank you
