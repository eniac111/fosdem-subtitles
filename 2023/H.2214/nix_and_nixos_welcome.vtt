00:00.000 --> 00:10.660
So, yeah, this is quite insane if you ask me, at least of how many people are in this

00:10.660 --> 00:12.300
very small room at this moment.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.260
But thank you all for coming, first and foremost.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.160
There is just, I have one more slide.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
That's it.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.560
And then I'll hand it over to the first speaker.

00:21.560 --> 00:27.760
But of course, we are at FOSDAM, so we have to abide by their rules.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.820
Please we just distributed some stickers.

00:29.820 --> 00:32.900
Please don't go sticking them all over their property.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.100
Keep them for your laptops.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.720
That's what they're meant for after all.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.200
Also be mindful of each other.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.160
This is a very well packed room.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.460
Apparently, it's going to get hot probably.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.540
If you just have to leave, just please kindly ask the person next to you.

00:46.540 --> 00:50.320
And please if somebody asks you, stand up, make some room.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.320
Just cooperate a little bit.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.760
It's going to be necessary in this situation at the moment.

00:54.760 --> 01:02.140
So with that being said, is everybody ready for an entire block of pure chaos and fun

01:02.140 --> 01:05.120
as well of everything to do with Nixx and NixxOS?

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
Yes.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Then all it is.

01:07.120 --> 01:25.240
Thank you.
