00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Thank you.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
So, hi.

00:02.000 --> 00:25.380
Today, I'll tell you a success story of adopting Nix at the workplace, all the way from reproducible

00:25.380 --> 00:30.200
CI builds to NixOS in production, and also what we have learned in the process.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.840
By the way, you can use the QR code to follow the slides on your devices if you want.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.960
I have some links there as well.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.360
So first, about me, I'm, well, now ex-principal software engineer at Profion.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.120
I've been using Nix in NixOS since 2016.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.680
Now Profion was a security company, and we were custodians of the NRX open source project.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.040
We were mostly focused on developing NRX and also providing network services around NRX.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.160
But, unfortunately, just earlier, we actually closed the company because we were out of

00:59.160 --> 01:02.960
money and couldn't secure funding or acquisition.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.800
So NRX was a confidential computing, well, is a confidential computing platform, providing

01:07.800 --> 01:14.360
you ability to run WebAssembly within TEEs, so hardware secure enclaves.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.080
And well, I'm not going to go into too much detail, but the relevant part here is that

01:18.080 --> 01:22.840
NRX builds trust based upon a remote attestation procedure.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.720
And to do that, basically how it works is that we, as Profion, we build a portable,

01:27.720 --> 01:32.400
mostly static NRX release binary, then we run it and we measure the memory pages within

01:32.400 --> 01:33.560
a TE.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.600
Then we add that to a allow list in an attestation service.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.840
And finally, then the user uses the release binary, and they, well, they also run it on

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
a TE.

01:42.840 --> 01:47.000
And we, in our attestation service, can verify that indeed they are running a trusted system,

01:47.000 --> 01:50.400
this trusted release of NRX within a real TE.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.640
But there are two questions, of course, which arise, which is what if the release version

01:53.640 --> 01:59.160
of NRX is compromised, or what if actually our build pipeline is compromised?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.880
So then you can also ask a question, so how can users actually verify that the source

02:02.880 --> 02:07.000
code that we have released, we say, okay, this release corresponds to this source code,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.440
how can I actually verify that it is indeed true?

02:10.440 --> 02:15.360
So if you would try to just do plain cargo build with a Rust project, then you'll notice

02:15.360 --> 02:19.520
that actually you get different binaries depending on the system in which you compile your binary.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.160
And so the answer to this is actually to use a produceable builds, which, of course, Nix

02:23.160 --> 02:26.640
gives us a way to do.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.040
So here is an example as well.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.640
So if I just compile it in the Docker container, right, and if I just do it locally, I get

02:32.640 --> 02:33.960
exactly the same binary.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.200
So I get exactly the same digest.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.640
But so how do we actually get here?

02:39.640 --> 02:41.080
It's all, of course, half of the shell.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.600
How do you develop anything without the Nix shell before in your project, right?

02:45.600 --> 02:53.000
And I got positive feedback on this, and, well, we infected the project with Nix.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.840
Just a few months later after that, something very surprising to me happened.

02:56.840 --> 03:01.400
It's one of our first outside contributions was actually an ARX build package.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.240
So I just added a shell with actual build script by Vincent from Germany.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.360
I don't know if you're here, but thank you very much if he's looking at this.

03:09.360 --> 03:14.240
And so by the time we had to ship and release, you know, like a big release of ARX, we already

03:14.240 --> 03:17.160
had all our Linux and Mac binary builds in the Flake.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.360
And we could also build OCI images in the Flake.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.360
I did some changes in the meantime.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.160
So yeah, it just made sense to use Nix for this.

03:25.160 --> 03:31.400
And we quickly discovered that actually building for ARM64 in QM on x86 runners was just too

03:31.400 --> 03:33.000
slow.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.360
So that's why I implemented cross compilation.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.480
It was tricky, but eventually it worked.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.080
But unfortunately it also made all functionality parameterized by the package set and also

03:41.080 --> 03:44.760
made Flakes very difficult to maintain a review, especially for people who are not familiar

03:44.760 --> 03:47.000
with Nix because I was the only Nix guy in the company.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.560
So it complicated things.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
And here's an example.

03:50.560 --> 03:57.200
I don't know if you can see, but before it looked like a just normal kind of build script,

03:57.200 --> 04:00.560
you know, like you would, if you, if you did get into packaging or no, Arch Linux packaging,

04:00.560 --> 04:02.480
you would kind of understand what's happening here.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.160
If you just use Rust, it's kind of clear what's happening.

04:05.160 --> 04:07.720
But when you have cross compilation, it gets difficult, right?

04:07.720 --> 04:10.560
You have a linker, you have a CC target prefix, right?

04:10.560 --> 04:16.680
You have, it's not clear, like let in block, there are two different package sets.

04:16.680 --> 04:21.520
So what's even worse is that, well, we had multiple repositories and initially we just

04:21.520 --> 04:23.200
duplicated our Flakes, right?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.280
Because we want to build everything reproducibly as well.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
We want to have cross compilation.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.360
We want to have just consistent, you know, CI.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.880
And we basically each Flake was branched off from a different version of the original Flake,

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
right?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.880
Because we also, we're keeping developing and changing things.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.320
So they start to diverge in some supple ways, but they still largely were doing exactly

04:41.320 --> 04:42.520
the same thing.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.420
And another thing is that because the Flake logs were actually managed independently,

04:46.420 --> 04:51.240
so we could benefit from some CI caching, but we actually couldn't because those potential

04:51.240 --> 04:53.440
hits will actually become a miss.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.800
So and then maintenance just became a burden over time.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.900
So let's just take a step back and think about, okay, what do we actually want to do?

05:00.900 --> 05:04.040
We just want to build some static Rust binaries, just like Cargo does, except it won't do

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
it reproducibly, right?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.840
We also want to have an OCI image for that binary, and ideally you also want to have

05:08.840 --> 05:12.120
a fast CI, but if you can't, all right, fine.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.800
But we don't really care how any of this is done, right?

05:14.800 --> 05:18.080
All we care about is that if Cargo can do it, we actually be able to do it as well.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.440
It should just add functionality, not remove any functionality.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.220
It doesn't make anything harder for us.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.920
And you could say, right, there are templates in Flakes, right?

05:25.920 --> 05:30.080
You could just write it once and then propagate across repositories and just use that.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.560
But it's not much different from just duplicating the Flake as I did before, right?

05:33.560 --> 05:38.040
You still have to adapt your template for the actual project, and you still have to

05:38.040 --> 05:42.640
maintain it's going to get out of date, and there should be a better way.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.960
So that's why I built a Mixify library.

05:45.960 --> 05:51.040
It's designed to be an easy to use, batteries-included library with opinionated but customizable defaults,

05:51.040 --> 05:52.840
and it just works well in CI.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.520
It doesn't try to cover all use cases, but it should be good enough for most.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.960
It just simply plugs into your existing language tooling and currently supports only Rust by

06:00.960 --> 06:05.160
a crane backend, but it could support other back-ends as well if you want to, and there

06:05.160 --> 06:09.520
is also support for other languages just kind of designed for.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.160
So what does it actually do?

06:11.160 --> 06:16.600
So per each default system, it provides you with a Flake check for listening and testing,

06:16.600 --> 06:20.920
development shell of your tool chain, format of your to-do, nixfumt, and then releasing

06:20.920 --> 06:25.840
debug builds for all targets with cross-compilation and OCI images and whatnot.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
Here's an example.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.320
So this is actually just a Rust Hello World application, right?

06:29.320 --> 06:34.680
I have just simply one input, which is Mixify, and I have just outputs generated by this

06:34.680 --> 06:39.400
makeFlake function, and the absolute minimum is just if I have one argument, which is a

06:39.400 --> 06:41.180
source.

06:41.180 --> 06:44.600
So Mixify will parse actually the Rust tool chain, a cargo.toml file if you're unfamiliar

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
with Rust.

06:45.600 --> 06:49.600
So Rust tool chain defines basically what version of a tool chain I want, what targets

06:49.600 --> 06:54.280
I want to have, and cargo.toml is just basically metadata about the package.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.880
So let's look at the Mixflake shell.

06:55.880 --> 07:00.520
I formatted the output because it just wouldn't fit on the screen, so this is the checks.

07:00.520 --> 07:06.680
So I get my linting, my formatter, the Rust formatter, and the testing on check.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.840
I get also a development shell with my tool chain and all the different systems.

07:10.840 --> 07:16.360
I get nixfumt already predefined, and I also have an overlay with actually the tool chain

07:16.360 --> 07:19.220
and all the packages, so including OCI images.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.400
And finally, that's the packages that are generated.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.040
So I have the native default build.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.200
I have also profiles for release builds and debug builds.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.240
You'll notice that there's no Darwin builds here, because again, I formatted.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.080
On Darwin, you would see also builds for Darwin, but you cannot cross-compile from Linux to

07:37.080 --> 07:38.400
Darwin, but you can do other way around.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.160
So on Darwin, you would see that as well.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.320
In fact, there was an issue with Mixpacker set right now.

07:43.320 --> 07:48.800
There is no, like one of the Darwin was not able to compile for the other one, unless

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
you can check yourself.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.320
So here's an example of nRx packaging with this tool.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.720
So I can also configure, for example, some paths to ignore to improve caching.

07:58.720 --> 08:04.200
I can configure the Clippy features, whatever I wanted to do there.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.400
So it's pretty small, pretty simple.

08:06.400 --> 08:12.280
I can add some, like for example, OpenSSL in my shell, and yeah, and it works.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.840
And nRx itself is, by the way, anything but a simple project.

08:15.840 --> 08:16.840
So it's using Nightly Rust.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.680
It has seven crates in the workspace.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.840
We actually use bin depth as well, so sometimes we build for three different targets at the

08:21.840 --> 08:28.480
same time, basically the trim and the execution layer, which are merged later in one binary.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.240
So this is what it means to actually build something in CI with this.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.720
So we just simply have a match for all our hosts and targets, and we just simply do nix

08:36.720 --> 08:39.800
build, and this is consistent in the same everywhere.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.520
The only difference would be the name of the package, but again, it could be removed if

08:43.520 --> 08:46.160
I wanted to.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.960
So next we have testing, and we have linting.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.360
It's pretty much exactly the same thing.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.040
Again, it could be a shared GitHub action workflow and just used everywhere.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.200
So how do we actually maintain and update this?

08:57.200 --> 09:02.360
Nixify changes are actually, for us, was propagated automatically, so we used GitHub action to

09:02.360 --> 09:04.720
actually do Nixflake update.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.680
So the changes were already reviewed by me, so I've audited the changes essentially, and

09:08.680 --> 09:12.800
then anyone in the team can actually, well, you can actually see the bottom, but you can

09:12.800 --> 09:17.160
actually review and auto-merge this because the team trusts me.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.800
This actually brings me to a trust question, which is an open question I just wanted to

09:20.800 --> 09:21.800
raise.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.200
So the Nixify state is essentially a root of a miracle tree, right, because it includes

09:25.200 --> 09:27.220
all the dependencies and digests of those.

09:27.220 --> 09:31.920
So I audit the state of the world, so a mixed package set and all the dependencies, so team

09:31.920 --> 09:36.600
trusts me, therefore they trust the world or my audit of it, so it's a transitive trust.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.900
But how can the team actually verify my audit?

09:38.900 --> 09:41.720
So can I sign the Nixify root in any way?

09:41.720 --> 09:43.520
Can I maybe add my signature on this?

09:43.520 --> 09:47.960
So maybe Nix could validate my signature, maybe it could be like a parameter, trust,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.280
only these projects.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.440
So that's just an open question.

09:51.440 --> 09:55.100
If you have answers, please let me know.

09:55.100 --> 09:59.160
So eventually it was time to deploy our services, and for NRXP it requires the amount of three

09:59.160 --> 10:05.040
kernel patches, Intel provided ASMD, PCCS service running, some U-Dev rules for the

10:05.040 --> 10:06.040
hardware.

10:06.040 --> 10:11.020
We had no dedicated operations engineer, and all our repositories were already Nixified,

10:11.020 --> 10:15.640
so we just made, well, we also had two cloud providers, which is AWS, Nix, Linux, both had

10:15.640 --> 10:18.880
Nix-OS support out of the box.

10:18.880 --> 10:24.280
Before we had Nix, we actually used custom OCI images for PCCS and ASMD, and those were

10:24.280 --> 10:28.120
basically just compiled once to some binaries that were put inside the image, and those

10:28.120 --> 10:32.120
images were outdated, largely annotated, no one knew what to do with them.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.800
We required custom provisioning steps, like to do podman secret create or something, and

10:36.800 --> 10:39.680
we also need manual U-Dev rules set up.

10:39.680 --> 10:44.160
So once again, open source come to help, so the PCCS and ASMD were actually turned out

10:44.160 --> 10:46.880
to actually be supported by Nix-OS already.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.720
Also the Intel SGX hardware was supported.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.960
By the way, again, it's either Vincent or one of his team, someone from his team who

10:51.960 --> 10:54.520
actually added this, so again, thank you.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.840
So if we just list, just these six lines were enough for us to just enable the services

10:58.840 --> 11:01.720
and all the hardware support.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.560
So next step was that I just added some simple Nix-OS modules for our services, set up secret

11:06.560 --> 11:11.400
management with soft-set Nix and deployment for deploy-RS, again, like simple tooling,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.480
automate deployments to testing environments.

11:13.480 --> 11:19.280
I set up CI to just test all PRs, so if the CI fails, the PR doesn't go through, so we

11:19.280 --> 11:20.560
don't update anything.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.040
And of course we have the automated updates, just like everywhere else, just for every

11:24.040 --> 11:26.560
other repository.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.640
So to begin with, we actually ended up doing this, so we actually were tracking tags of

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
different projects.

11:31.640 --> 11:36.640
So you can see there are three groups of, well, these are the services, different environments,

11:36.640 --> 11:41.120
so we just have three different inputs, and essentially we progress, we test things in

11:41.120 --> 11:43.720
staging, then we go to production, right?

11:43.720 --> 11:48.080
If I were to redo this, I would actually use branches, something like Nix package-set channels

11:48.080 --> 11:52.640
where you essentially just do a release, right, then you merge it to, say, unstable, eventually

11:52.640 --> 11:54.560
you test that, you can promote it to stable.

11:54.560 --> 12:00.080
So I think that's more work upstream, but it's easier to, well, maintain downstream,

12:00.080 --> 12:02.520
it just makes sense.

12:02.520 --> 12:07.200
So you could ask, okay, why don't we just use OCI for this, but the thing to understand,

12:07.200 --> 12:11.400
with Nix, we get source code references, not binary references, so essentially we get all

12:11.400 --> 12:14.040
the benefits of binaries without actually sacrificing any usability.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.000
In fact, we will get things, like updates, and the flag.log is nothing else than really

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
a software-built materials, right, which is the buzzword today, and everyone really cares

12:22.000 --> 12:23.480
about it.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.400
So because in the flag.log, what you get is that you can audit the whole state of the

12:27.400 --> 12:33.080
world, right, you can audit all the service source code, you can audit all the build dependencies,

12:33.080 --> 12:37.560
and you can audit also all the tooling that you used to actually deploy this stuff, right,

12:37.560 --> 12:42.120
and you have a consistent, simple update procedure, which is Nix flag update, it's super fast

12:42.120 --> 12:46.360
to deploy once you have your module set up and you know how to use Nix, it's just, boom,

12:46.360 --> 12:51.600
you're just there, and of course you get rollbacks with Nix OS or really any deployment tool

12:51.600 --> 12:53.960
that's used Nix.

12:53.960 --> 12:58.560
So next step was actually providing things like AMIs and whatever else, so I used just

12:58.560 --> 13:04.600
Nix OS generators for it, and the way I did it, I just simply imported the Nix OS module,

13:04.600 --> 13:08.440
like a common module from our infrastructure, and it took me less than a day to set up,

13:08.440 --> 13:13.240
and this is for SGX and AMD, SCV, again, it's extremely powerful and just extremely simple

13:13.240 --> 13:15.640
to use.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.240
I do have to mention that we asked ourselves a question, okay, so how many enterprises

13:20.240 --> 13:25.360
would actually use Nix OS to deploy NARX, that was probably not so many, so once we

13:25.360 --> 13:29.720
actually got a dedicated operations engineer, we eventually moved most of our services to

13:29.720 --> 13:35.560
Kubernetes, but there was a little win, because for every service that actually required custom

13:35.560 --> 13:40.280
kernel, custom services, custom U-dev rules, those things are difficult to set up, and

13:40.280 --> 13:45.080
those actually were kept in Nix OS, which brings me to my next point, that Nix and Nix

13:45.080 --> 13:50.120
OS actually, in my opinion at least, make difficult things simple, right, and in this

13:50.120 --> 13:54.720
case for me it was great for prototyping, it was great for productivity, for composability,

13:54.720 --> 13:59.800
for building literally anything anywhere, and for audibility and trust.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.880
One particular thing I want to mention about productivity here is, like if you ask me one

14:03.880 --> 14:08.160
killer feature of Nix, at least from my perspective, this is that, right, so we had for example

14:08.160 --> 14:13.240
lab machines with SGX and AMD, SCV hardware, and I did it countless times when I was just

14:13.240 --> 14:17.240
developing something as a feature branch, and I just needed to test it out, I just SSH,

14:17.240 --> 14:22.040
I do Nix run, GitHub colon, you know, my repository, my branch, and I just run it, I don't need

14:22.040 --> 14:26.480
to use Git to add a new remote, I don't need to set up my toolchain, nothing, I can just

14:26.480 --> 14:31.080
SSH and run it, so I think that's really powerful.

14:31.080 --> 14:35.360
So another thing is that if you introduce Nix, of course it's also your responsibility

14:35.360 --> 14:40.880
to T-shirt, right, so you are the FM in RTFM, right, so for my case I had the Nix 101 classes

14:40.880 --> 14:47.200
on Fridays, and the real uncommon thing about Nix, I think, to people, is the functional

14:47.200 --> 14:51.720
programming part, so I ended up teaching a lot of functional programming principles to

14:51.720 --> 14:57.040
actually explain Nix, and also just introducing teams to the ecosystem, because, well, if

14:57.040 --> 15:02.320
you just newcomer to Nix, it may be overwhelming, it's not clear why there's Nix, a Nix package

15:02.320 --> 15:07.120
set, a Nix device, how they're related, and I also created a Nix channel for questions,

15:07.120 --> 15:10.240
so whenever people had questions I would just answer them.

15:10.240 --> 15:16.240
So some derivations from this, it's really important to give people examples of how to

15:16.240 --> 15:21.040
get things done, like real examples, and it's very great also to give analogies with known

15:21.040 --> 15:26.440
technologies, and, okay, so this is not exactly what you would do in Nix, but I implemented

15:26.440 --> 15:30.960
Fibonacci in Nix and in Rust, right, you have to just show them two side by side, right,

15:30.960 --> 15:34.960
I have a main function here in Nix, I have a main function over here, both of which are

15:34.960 --> 15:40.400
in both print Fibonacci examples, right, so it just works, you don't see but up here the

15:40.400 --> 15:46.120
same, and yeah, so this kind of is an example of how you can show the people that, you know,

15:46.120 --> 15:49.200
it's not so scary after all, right, it's just the same function, just look at it, right,

15:49.200 --> 15:51.960
it's the same thing.

15:51.960 --> 15:56.720
So one thing I noticed also that Nix is perceived as being pretty novel, so I asked people the

15:56.720 --> 16:01.440
question like, okay, so how long do you think Nix exists, and I got answers all the way

16:01.440 --> 16:05.840
from two to ten years, where ten was like a real stretch, you know, it can't be so long,

16:05.840 --> 16:09.240
but the real answer is 20 years, if you look at the Git log, right, I don't know, maybe

16:09.240 --> 16:13.080
it was not developed before, maybe it was earlier, but that's what I see from the Git

16:13.080 --> 16:15.160
log.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.480
Some frequently asked questions they've received is, okay, I'm not on Nix OS, how do I use

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
Nix?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.200
Or I'm trying to use the flakes, but I get an error, and why are flakes experimental?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.160
It is safe to depend on some other features, what if I get abandoned?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.400
Where is our shell?

16:29.400 --> 16:34.800
So a few things we can note here that, at least in my experience, Nix is tightly associated

16:34.800 --> 16:39.600
with Nix OS, but we need to understand, or at least explain to newcomers, I believe,

16:39.600 --> 16:45.160
that Nix is not just another package manager, right, so Nix OS is just one possible output

16:45.160 --> 16:50.240
for Nix build, but it's just that, right, it can build many other things, and I think

16:50.240 --> 16:56.160
we should present it as a generic build tool, which is not tied to a particular OS, and

16:56.160 --> 17:00.040
sometimes for people familiar with Docker, I even presented something like Docker or

17:00.040 --> 17:04.000
Podman, where you basically have a Docker file, you can build a Docker file, it's put

17:04.000 --> 17:10.800
in your store, and you can run it afterwards, right, it's something like that, maybe.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.440
So yeah, this thing was such a pain.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.760
So come on, guys, we need to do something about this, right?

17:17.760 --> 17:22.920
I mean, you hear about this Nix thing, it's so cool, but it's so difficult, so out there,

17:22.920 --> 17:28.560
and your very first try in Nix is a failure, right, I understand that this error is descriptive,

17:28.560 --> 17:33.200
yes, you read this, you kind of understand what to do, mostly, but it's just not a good

17:33.200 --> 17:38.800
developer experience, right, and I think we should, I don't know, I don't know what to

17:38.800 --> 17:44.880
do, there are possible solutions, but we really need to do something about this as a community.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.880
So thank you, this, you can...

17:48.880 --> 18:01.680
Yeah, as I said, profing close, I'm looking for a job, by the way, but yeah, any questions,

17:50.880 --> 18:12.680
Connect, and there are any examples, like if you have a C project, Nix or the other,

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
maybe?

18:02.680 --> 18:03.680
Yeah, go ahead.

18:03.680 --> 18:12.680
So you say Nix can basically be a generic build system, like the Nix or the Post

18:12.680 --> 18:15.120
then it's wrong.

18:15.120 --> 18:21.440
Right, so the question is, can Nix be a generic build system like Maison, or you know, Autotools,

18:21.440 --> 18:27.000
whatever, so I'm not a C developer, I've never was, I believe so, I believe you will be able

18:27.000 --> 18:31.360
to do, at least for Rust, it was a breeze to do, I can definitely imagine doing that

18:31.360 --> 18:37.520
for Go as well, and I think that was pretty, so for example, I compile, so we had a collection

18:37.520 --> 18:43.000
of examples where we mostly compiled to Wazi, so for C it was actually very, very simple,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.160
so I would think so.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.160
The only thing to care, to think about though, so it's great for releases, not so great for

18:49.160 --> 18:52.480
development because, for example, with Rust, you have this target directory with all your

18:52.480 --> 18:54.920
cache, so you don't get that anymore, right?

18:54.920 --> 18:59.200
Or, I mean, you have to, you can do things around it, you can maybe build some library

18:59.200 --> 19:04.640
to actually achieve that.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
Maybe you can do it and contribute.

19:05.640 --> 19:13.520
If I may add about this, there is some RFC on how you can enable things to become, make

19:13.520 --> 19:18.200
replacements, but there are much more things which are a bit complicated on how you make

19:18.200 --> 19:19.200
it fast.

19:19.200 --> 19:36.200
So, yeah, that is what he's looking for, I would say.

19:36.200 --> 19:56.920
Okay, I'll check it out, thanks, I don't know that.

19:56.920 --> 20:07.840
Thank you.
