1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Thank you.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:11.240
There's too many people there.

3
0:00:11.240 --> 0:00:13.440
I wasn't ready for that.

4
0:00:13.440 --> 0:00:19.000
If they told me I would have finished my slice sooner.

5
0:00:19.000 --> 0:00:23.200
So yeah, thank you everyone for being there.

6
0:00:23.200 --> 0:00:29.240
It's really energizing to see so many people interested in Nix, NixOS.

7
0:00:29.240 --> 0:00:31.760
So I work at a company called Twig.

8
0:00:31.760 --> 0:00:33.640
My name is Guillaume.

9
0:00:33.640 --> 0:00:35.800
We love Nix, Twig.

10
0:00:35.800 --> 0:00:37.160
If you don't know about us,

11
0:00:37.160 --> 0:00:38.680
check out our blog, we have.

12
0:00:38.680 --> 0:00:40.520
So it's okay.

13
0:00:40.520 --> 0:00:44.720
So while my job as work is more data,

14
0:00:44.720 --> 0:00:47.880
science, and just software in general,

15
0:00:47.880 --> 0:00:49.880
I'm a Nix enthusiast.

16
0:00:49.880 --> 0:00:51.600
I started three years ago,

17
0:00:51.600 --> 0:00:54.040
could not stop since then.

18
0:00:54.040 --> 0:00:58.040
My rabbit hole was just managing CUDA basically.

19
0:00:58.040 --> 0:00:59.760
As a Nix enthusiast,

20
0:00:59.760 --> 0:01:04.680
I have one thing I can't stop thinking about,

21
0:01:04.680 --> 0:01:09.360
which is I want everyone to use Nix.

22
0:01:09.360 --> 0:01:10.480
I want you to use Nix,

23
0:01:10.480 --> 0:01:11.920
I want you to use Nix,

24
0:01:11.920 --> 0:01:13.960
I want you to use Nix, I want.

25
0:01:13.960 --> 0:01:16.600
So before I start,

26
0:01:16.600 --> 0:01:21.960
does anyone not use Nix on a daily basis here?

27
0:01:22.080 --> 0:01:24.720
Okay. So I want you to use Nix.

28
0:01:24.720 --> 0:01:28.800
I want you to. Okay. So,

29
0:01:28.800 --> 0:01:30.160
and to the other people in the room,

30
0:01:30.160 --> 0:01:31.200
guys, what are you doing?

31
0:01:31.200 --> 0:01:33.480
There's two people not using Nix.

32
0:01:33.480 --> 0:01:37.040
So as you might know,

33
0:01:37.040 --> 0:01:42.040
I want to be able to make anyone use Nix.

34
0:01:42.040 --> 0:01:46.480
But there is a but.

35
0:01:46.480 --> 0:01:49.520
In the sentence, we have both.

36
0:01:49.520 --> 0:01:51.800
Anyone?

37
0:01:51.800 --> 0:01:55.480
Nix.

38
0:01:55.480 --> 0:01:58.440
In the same sentence.

39
0:01:58.920 --> 0:02:02.080
Ideally, this is what the combination of

40
0:02:02.080 --> 0:02:05.000
these words should mean.

41
0:02:06.560 --> 0:02:10.000
Nix users know better.

42
0:02:10.000 --> 0:02:15.200
So Nix is not an easy tool to use.

43
0:02:15.200 --> 0:02:19.600
In order to be completely autonomous with Nix and NixOS,

44
0:02:19.600 --> 0:02:24.960
you need a vast amount of knowledge to model your way.

45
0:02:24.960 --> 0:02:27.200
Through all kinds of problems

46
0:02:27.200 --> 0:02:29.760
and before you get anything to run properly.

47
0:02:29.760 --> 0:02:33.480
However, I am a believer.

48
0:02:33.480 --> 0:02:36.880
I think we can, in fact,

49
0:02:36.880 --> 0:02:41.640
not have this but reach

50
0:02:41.640 --> 0:02:46.000
this wonderful world where everyone can use it.

51
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:49.560
So let me tell you a story that happened

52
0:02:49.560 --> 0:02:52.880
in a company that I might have heard about.

53
0:02:52.880 --> 0:02:55.480
So in this company, we have Emma.

54
0:02:55.480 --> 0:02:59.200
Say hello to Emma. Thank you.

55
0:02:59.200 --> 0:03:02.480
The company didn't expect people to actually reply to that.

56
0:03:02.480 --> 0:03:04.840
I'm delighted that you are. Thank you.

57
0:03:04.840 --> 0:03:06.320
I feel less lonely there.

58
0:03:06.320 --> 0:03:08.360
The company being rather small,

59
0:03:08.360 --> 0:03:13.360
she has to handle all HR by herself because she's the HR.

60
0:03:13.520 --> 0:03:19.480
So she manages the employees contract as any HR would.

61
0:03:19.480 --> 0:03:22.240
It turns out that even though the company is small,

62
0:03:22.240 --> 0:03:26.400
she has processed a lot of contracts.

63
0:03:28.560 --> 0:03:30.600
I mean really a lot.

64
0:03:30.600 --> 0:03:33.880
Oops. I spent too much time on this animation.

65
0:03:33.880 --> 0:03:36.520
Not too good to let it go to waste. Sorry.

66
0:03:36.520 --> 0:03:40.720
So she has been using a software for quite some time.

67
0:03:40.720 --> 0:03:43.080
You might recognize the logo.

68
0:03:43.080 --> 0:03:48.160
To process demo and it has been going fine.

69
0:03:48.160 --> 0:03:54.000
But someday, a task come to her so huge is stupid.

70
0:03:54.000 --> 0:03:56.960
We all know this kind of stupid task.

71
0:03:56.960 --> 0:03:59.720
Let's say for instance that she has to go through

72
0:03:59.720 --> 0:04:01.760
all the contracts and find

73
0:04:01.760 --> 0:04:04.760
all the employees that had some specific terms.

74
0:04:04.760 --> 0:04:10.600
She now has to spend hours and hours and days going

75
0:04:10.600 --> 0:04:12.800
through all each one contract reading,

76
0:04:12.800 --> 0:04:14.560
looking for the terms etc etc.

77
0:04:14.560 --> 0:04:16.880
It's boring. It is repetitive.

78
0:04:16.880 --> 0:04:23.280
If only there was a way to do it without doing it manually.

79
0:04:24.800 --> 0:04:28.680
As she's starting to drown in her own despair,

80
0:04:28.680 --> 0:04:32.680
suddenly appears in her slack.

81
0:04:32.880 --> 0:04:37.120
Someone who says, I think I can be of help.

82
0:04:37.120 --> 0:04:39.920
It's an engineer, she says.

83
0:04:39.920 --> 0:04:43.600
Little does she know that it's not just an engineer.

84
0:04:43.600 --> 0:04:48.080
Anyway, our hero knows that she uses a SAS to process

85
0:04:48.080 --> 0:04:50.880
the contract and a SAS often has an API.

86
0:04:50.880 --> 0:04:52.800
So it can be automated.

87
0:04:52.800 --> 0:04:55.400
So he says, I can do it in minutes.

88
0:04:55.400 --> 0:04:59.560
Is he a spy? He puts in his hacking gloves,

89
0:04:59.560 --> 0:05:03.280
starts typing fursuously and am I is no.

90
0:05:03.280 --> 0:05:05.920
He says, give me access to your account and I will get

91
0:05:05.920 --> 0:05:07.440
the data on my machine and I will

92
0:05:07.440 --> 0:05:09.760
proceed it for you and I will pass it to you.

93
0:05:09.760 --> 0:05:12.760
But then Emma looks at him in fear.

94
0:05:12.760 --> 0:05:14.880
It's forbidden by law.

95
0:05:14.880 --> 0:05:18.040
Indeed, we now have to face a terrible foe.

96
0:05:18.040 --> 0:05:24.400
GDPR. You should not have access to this data or will be in trouble.

97
0:05:24.400 --> 0:05:28.760
There were these close to solving the problem.

98
0:05:28.760 --> 0:05:31.320
But our hero knows that it ain't easy to run

99
0:05:31.320 --> 0:05:33.920
a custom script on Novice computer.

100
0:05:33.920 --> 0:05:37.320
You would have to grow through many challenges.

101
0:05:37.320 --> 0:05:39.680
Making someone use a terminal,

102
0:05:39.680 --> 0:05:42.040
installing dependencies,

103
0:05:42.040 --> 0:05:46.040
sending the code and most of it all fixing it

104
0:05:46.040 --> 0:05:49.200
because it never works on the first trial.

105
0:05:49.200 --> 0:05:54.120
So if only there was a simple way to run

106
0:05:54.120 --> 0:05:58.720
a program on someone computer without such hassle.

107
0:05:59.120 --> 0:06:02.240
If only there was.

108
0:06:02.240 --> 0:06:06.880
But fortunately for us, there's Nix.

109
0:06:06.880 --> 0:06:17.080
A single flat road for the user. So step one, install Nix.

110
0:06:21.320 --> 0:06:25.480
Step two, give her one liner to run a program.

111
0:06:25.480 --> 0:06:30.800
Actually, this one. First one, you got the joke.

112
0:06:30.800 --> 0:06:33.800
But it's beautiful and as you can imagine,

113
0:06:33.800 --> 0:06:36.040
this is sort of a true story.

114
0:06:36.040 --> 0:06:38.400
There really was an HR,

115
0:06:38.400 --> 0:06:42.600
there really was a company and I can say it out loud,

116
0:06:42.600 --> 0:06:44.320
I got HR to use Nix.

117
0:06:44.320 --> 0:06:46.800
The command I just put you.

118
0:06:50.960 --> 0:06:54.840
Yeah, I really do consider it an achievement.

119
0:06:54.840 --> 0:06:57.400
I put it in my tiles.

120
0:06:57.400 --> 0:07:00.560
If only it could be displayed over my head.

121
0:07:00.560 --> 0:07:03.240
So when I submitted my talk,

122
0:07:03.240 --> 0:07:05.680
I put the subtitle and you've seen it on

123
0:07:05.680 --> 0:07:08.480
the first slide, it will be fine.

124
0:07:08.480 --> 0:07:09.960
When I wrote it a month ago,

125
0:07:09.960 --> 0:07:12.120
it was supposed to be sarcastic, ironic,

126
0:07:12.120 --> 0:07:15.320
but I was supposed to roast Nix.

127
0:07:15.320 --> 0:07:18.200
I'm in a toxic relationship as you can see.

128
0:07:18.200 --> 0:07:21.040
But when I thought about this one story,

129
0:07:21.040 --> 0:07:23.400
I realized that in fact,

130
0:07:23.400 --> 0:07:28.920
it did work and that was what was incredible at the time.

131
0:07:28.920 --> 0:07:30.120
I was just writing a script,

132
0:07:30.120 --> 0:07:33.600
a Python script in five and shipping Python,

133
0:07:33.600 --> 0:07:37.120
I've done it to some other people for the same reason,

134
0:07:37.120 --> 0:07:40.320
like privacy and it's always nightmare

135
0:07:40.320 --> 0:07:42.360
because people really wanted to work on

136
0:07:42.360 --> 0:07:45.720
the machine and you can't touch it and stuff like that.

137
0:07:45.720 --> 0:07:50.880
So this illustrates why I love Nix.

138
0:07:50.880 --> 0:07:52.800
It just works.

139
0:07:52.800 --> 0:07:56.040
Machines are capricious,

140
0:07:56.040 --> 0:08:02.120
but Nix makes like a highway for us to make things run on them.

141
0:08:02.120 --> 0:08:07.760
It pays the way for software to not just work on my machine,

142
0:08:07.760 --> 0:08:11.120
but on any machine and I think this is

143
0:08:11.120 --> 0:08:14.080
what makes Nix have such an impact.

144
0:08:15.200 --> 0:08:18.600
If Nix can just do that,

145
0:08:18.600 --> 0:08:20.880
it's already quite enough.

146
0:08:21.040 --> 0:08:25.000
Is it sometimes a pain to write packages,

147
0:08:25.000 --> 0:08:27.840
to have to debug them because you're

148
0:08:27.840 --> 0:08:31.080
using a recursive function that at the end doesn't work and

149
0:08:31.080 --> 0:08:33.440
you have really not the good error message?

150
0:08:33.440 --> 0:08:35.600
Yes, sure, it is a pain to use.

151
0:08:35.600 --> 0:08:37.000
But at the end of the day,

152
0:08:37.000 --> 0:08:40.920
if it's the only way we have to do what I just did,

153
0:08:40.920 --> 0:08:44.440
then isn't it worth it? Do you know it?

154
0:08:44.440 --> 0:08:49.560
So my final word would be to all Nixers here,

155
0:08:49.560 --> 0:08:54.760
let's not make other people use Nix because it's cool tech.

156
0:08:54.760 --> 0:09:00.920
Let's make it because it makes someone else life cooler. Thank you.

157
0:09:00.920 --> 0:09:02.280
Thank you.

158
0:09:08.200 --> 0:09:10.560
So I have my minutes left.

159
0:09:10.560 --> 0:09:13.560
It was just a silly story to get you to breathe a bit between

160
0:09:13.560 --> 0:09:17.680
the interesting parts but if you have any questions.

161
0:09:17.920 --> 0:09:20.880
We do have questions.

162
0:09:20.880 --> 0:09:27.840
In which company does HJr not use Windows?

163
0:09:27.840 --> 0:09:34.040
So the question is,

164
0:09:34.040 --> 0:09:36.520
in which company does HJr not use Windows?

165
0:09:36.520 --> 0:09:42.320
Which is a great tricky question that I did on purpose to,

166
0:09:42.320 --> 0:09:45.760
yeah, it was on my quest as you could have seen.

167
0:09:45.760 --> 0:09:51.040
It was for some companies I guess.

168
0:09:51.040 --> 0:09:57.600
Yeah? Yeah?

169
0:09:57.600 --> 0:09:59.320
Do you use Windows?

170
0:09:59.320 --> 0:10:00.120
Sorry?

171
0:10:00.120 --> 0:10:02.480
I see you use Windows.

172
0:10:02.480 --> 0:10:04.920
I'm sorry. So the question is,

173
0:10:04.920 --> 0:10:08.840
why do I use Windows because I can run NixOS on it anyway?

174
0:10:08.840 --> 0:10:12.400
Some software just don't work yet.

175
0:10:12.400 --> 0:10:17.000
If you can make Ableton work on NixOS, I'm taking it.

176
0:10:17.000 --> 0:10:21.680
Still questions, how many minutes left? Yeah?

177
0:10:21.680 --> 0:10:26.600
We have a few HJr to run Nix to run your script.

178
0:10:26.600 --> 0:10:29.600
So why don't you for example use Nix to build an OCI image

179
0:10:29.600 --> 0:10:31.880
and run for a proper container?

180
0:10:31.880 --> 0:10:33.640
That's a very good question.

181
0:10:33.640 --> 0:10:35.560
This is, sorry?

182
0:10:35.560 --> 0:10:37.760
Oh yeah. So the question is, sorry.

183
0:10:37.760 --> 0:10:42.440
Why didn't I just build a Docker image basically to run it?

184
0:10:42.440 --> 0:10:46.040
This is what I did a few years ago when I had to

185
0:10:46.040 --> 0:10:49.840
ship Python and it turns out that Docker was a pain

186
0:10:49.840 --> 0:10:55.320
to use on someone's computer because there are too many buttons.

187
0:10:55.920 --> 0:10:59.880
Docker desktop to get running on someone's machine that just

188
0:10:59.880 --> 0:11:02.880
don't know or want to know how Docker works.

189
0:11:02.880 --> 0:11:05.640
Sometimes just like you have to turn it on,

190
0:11:05.640 --> 0:11:07.640
you have to wait for it to,

191
0:11:07.640 --> 0:11:12.760
it's too complex to hear it in this situation.

192
0:11:12.760 --> 0:11:17.960
Or you can argue against that but in my case it turns out to be.

193
0:11:17.960 --> 0:11:20.600
I wanted to use Nix to be fair.

194
0:11:20.600 --> 0:11:23.080
A lot of problem statement,

195
0:11:23.080 --> 0:11:26.960
you said that you need to teach the HR person command line,

196
0:11:26.960 --> 0:11:30.160
package manager, app N and then execute the script.

197
0:11:30.160 --> 0:11:33.640
Now, Nix kind of solved three of those things,

198
0:11:33.640 --> 0:11:35.120
you still need the command line.

199
0:11:35.120 --> 0:11:35.880
Yeah.

200
0:11:35.880 --> 0:11:38.240
Yes. Yeah.

201
0:11:38.240 --> 0:11:41.840
So, so the question is,

202
0:11:41.840 --> 0:11:44.400
I'm sorry I just can't get that in my head.

203
0:11:44.400 --> 0:11:47.480
Thank you. So the question is,

204
0:11:47.480 --> 0:11:50.880
so yeah, I said there were different parts of the problem to

205
0:11:50.880 --> 0:11:54.720
solve like installing dependencies and moving the scripts

206
0:11:54.720 --> 0:11:59.600
and getting people to use the command line to run the script etc.

207
0:11:59.600 --> 0:12:04.520
So, but there's still the fact that we need to use the terminal.

208
0:12:04.520 --> 0:12:11.800
I bypass that by giving things just to copy and paste.

209
0:12:11.800 --> 0:12:13.400
Basically.

210
0:12:13.400 --> 0:12:18.200
Then terminal on Mac isn't that hard to find actually.

211
0:12:18.200 --> 0:12:20.280
It wasn't the hardest part.

212
0:12:20.280 --> 0:12:25.720
The hardest parts were getting the API key from the SaaS.

213
0:12:25.720 --> 0:12:31.000
Because you have to make people click through the UI of the SaaS.

214
0:12:31.000 --> 0:12:33.840
Yeah. I think that's about it.

215
0:12:33.840 --> 0:12:42.360
Thank you everyone.
