00:00.000 --> 00:16.680
Okay, 10-20. Welcome everyone. Everyone can hear me right? Good. Welcome to my talk about

00:16.680 --> 00:23.120
Hetty. Well, first of all, I promised to wave to my wife. She's waching at home. Can you

00:23.120 --> 00:31.200
all say hi, Susan? She never thought this would ever happen being talked to from the

00:31.200 --> 00:37.720
biggest open source conference in the world. She's at the couch with a broken ankle and

00:37.720 --> 00:48.520
a poor hair. Okay, my name is Mark Heezen. I'm a lecturer in IT at a applied university

00:48.520 --> 01:05.520
in the Netherlands. And I'm doing this talk about Hetty. And Hetty is a gradual, multilingual

01:05.520 --> 01:11.040
programming language for teaching. Instead of all the other languages here, they're for

01:11.040 --> 01:22.480
learning, I think. This one's for teaching, specific. And it's multilingual. And why is

01:22.480 --> 01:30.720
it here? It was invented and usually mostly built by Felina Herman, a professor in the

01:30.720 --> 01:39.200
Netherlands. She's a professor mainly in how do we learn programming. She wrote a book

01:39.200 --> 01:45.280
about it. You should definitely read it. What was it? The programmer's brain. You become

01:45.280 --> 01:51.440
a really better programmer by just reading that. But how did she come to this? Somewhere

01:51.440 --> 01:59.000
in the past, for her it was 2013, for me in 2019, there was a group of children that wanted

01:59.000 --> 02:09.440
to learn programming. And, well, we program. So we said, I'll teach it. That's pretty easy.

02:09.440 --> 02:19.560
We started to think, how do you teach programming? How were we taught programming? Well, we weren't.

02:19.560 --> 02:27.280
We just sat in front of a computer with a cursor. And in my case, I started typing hexadecimal

02:27.280 --> 02:33.720
coding. I typed over from the nibble or the byte. Those are magazines some of you might

02:33.720 --> 02:42.920
know. Probably not. I see some nodding. But, okay. And this would result in three things.

02:42.920 --> 02:52.320
It either worked. Those moments were pretty sparse. It wouldn't work. Or it said beep.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.800
These were the three options I had. Felina was a little luckier. I was a few days or

02:57.800 --> 03:05.680
a few years later a little luckier. We did not have a teacher, but we had a book. In

03:05.680 --> 03:13.360
Felina's case, a book of basic programming. And once you get to this, well, you can read

03:13.360 --> 03:17.880
it. You can read it. This is plain English. To us programmers, this is plain English.

03:17.880 --> 03:26.440
It even has line numbers. So if there's an error, it actually tells you it's a line number

03:26.440 --> 03:35.480
120. And it even puts out some text telling you what's wrong. Wow. Compilers are perfect

03:35.480 --> 03:43.360
teachers. That's what we thought. This is how we learned. We never realized that 90%

03:43.360 --> 03:51.040
or 99% of the people didn't think this. And they quit programming. They never got anywhere

03:51.040 --> 04:03.560
further than beep. So most of the coding dojos or code clubs start using Scratch. It's pretty

04:03.560 --> 04:10.800
easy. It takes a lot of the syntax away by using block programming. You can actually

04:10.800 --> 04:16.880
ask children to build this. And some of them will say, oh, yeah. And some of them will

04:16.880 --> 04:25.800
say, 14 or 15. Scratch is for kids. If I Google code, it never looks like this. I want to

04:25.800 --> 04:37.120
do the real stuff. I want to do zim zalabim. So Felina started coding with this sort of

04:37.120 --> 04:46.240
Python. And she said, the first thing I like to learn is input and output. She's a teacher.

04:46.240 --> 04:54.120
She knows how to teach. Baby steps. The first thing is first, input and output. Let's use

04:54.120 --> 04:59.880
some output. Print hello, everyone. Enter. And voila. Hello, everyone. Children really

04:59.880 --> 05:07.680
like this. It's easy. Unless there's some red scribbling below, they don't care. They

05:07.680 --> 05:15.360
still press enter. And this lovely teacher tells them some mumble jumble and then in

05:15.360 --> 05:23.320
line five, name print is not defined. And the children, well, I did define print. If

05:23.320 --> 05:31.680
they understand English, only if they understand English, mine don't. They're from eight years

05:31.680 --> 05:37.840
old and up. They don't know. They don't know what is and they don't recognize that there's

05:37.840 --> 05:48.280
a capital P in there. This one's even worse. It's missing a parenthesis at the end. And

05:48.280 --> 05:56.900
their lovely compiler will tell you some empty lines and then unexpected EOF while parsing.

05:56.900 --> 06:04.880
This eight year old kid asked me what is parsing? Try to explain parsing while print is not

06:04.880 --> 06:14.760
even in their minds yet. It's not that easy. There's too much going on. Too much interference

06:14.760 --> 06:20.880
in learning. This is not a way of learning. And there's even a better one since we're

06:20.880 --> 06:29.880
using Python. Did anybody see it shift a little? There's a space in there. Well, Python knows

06:29.880 --> 06:39.040
it's not supposed to be there. Unexpected indent. When I was finished explaining parsing,

06:39.040 --> 06:48.080
this was my next problem. So compilers are lovely teachers. Okay, that was true for me.

06:48.080 --> 06:53.640
That was true for some of you. And the 99% of the others that didn't make it to this

06:53.640 --> 07:03.880
conference is was not a lovely teacher. The next phase, if I get through to input and

07:03.880 --> 07:13.920
output, the next one is iteration repetition. For I in range for print I can I can explain

07:13.920 --> 07:22.200
that. I think I have an old hour. Classes are an hour. Just one hour to explain repetition.

07:22.200 --> 07:29.280
Well, the kids only see colons brackets and spaces. And they mumble jumble them through

07:29.280 --> 07:36.000
each other. I can give them an example and they can press run and they say, okay, okay,

07:36.000 --> 07:42.200
but it can never reproduce this. Not in an hour at least. Not my kids. Maybe some others

07:42.200 --> 07:49.200
can but not in my class. Syntax creates too much cognitive load. They have to remember

07:49.200 --> 07:58.600
too much things to actually get to the stuff I want them to learn. This is not new to programming.

07:58.600 --> 08:07.520
This is true for any language. It's true for math. How did you do that? Well, we just start

08:07.520 --> 08:14.640
with small bits. If you start writing, you write an A and an I and an N and an E. And

08:14.640 --> 08:20.240
we would say to the kid that produced this, wow, that's a lovely A. Oh, and you already

08:20.240 --> 08:28.080
made a word in. They're not separated much. It's a word. That's good. And that E is wonderful.

08:28.080 --> 08:36.000
It's even nicely on the line. Three compliments, four compliments and a lot of learning. The

08:36.000 --> 08:43.920
next thing they know is they can create words, cat, in, tree. And once they grasp that, we're

08:43.920 --> 08:51.640
going to make it a little harder. We start sentences with a capital letter. And the capital

08:51.640 --> 08:56.480
S or T is completely different than the lower one. So they have to learn a complete new

08:56.480 --> 09:03.960
set of letters. The C looks alike, but some of them are very different. And in some languages,

09:03.960 --> 09:11.520
almost all of them are different. After that, we teach them, okay, we started with a capital.

09:11.520 --> 09:16.480
We end it with a period. And once we end it with a period, once they know a sentence ends

09:16.480 --> 09:24.160
with a period, they can actually spread sentences over lines. This is maybe sixth grade or something.

09:24.160 --> 09:31.300
Or I'm not sure where exactly we are now, but it's gradually changing. Rules are changing.

09:31.300 --> 09:39.640
It's not bad to change the rules every now and then. It's good in this case. Same for

09:39.640 --> 09:45.640
math. If I have five apples and I take three, how much do you have left? What? Two. They

09:45.640 --> 09:52.440
know that. If you have three and I'm trying to take five, how much do you have left? Zero.

09:52.440 --> 09:59.440
Yeah. Only years later, you'll learn that there is a possibility you have minus two

09:59.440 --> 10:07.080
apples. Happy appetite. Dividing same. Eight divided by three, that's two. And then there

10:07.080 --> 10:13.560
is two remaining. I cannot divide the latter two by three anymore. And then there is two

10:13.560 --> 10:23.520
thirds and then there is 2.6666 and that takes a long life. Can we actually teach code gradually?

10:23.520 --> 10:38.240
Well, yes, we can now. We can by using Hetty. This is Hetty. This is the program environment.

10:38.240 --> 10:47.440
And the first line of code you can actually run is print hello world. And it works. And

10:47.440 --> 10:56.620
you see there are no quotation marks, no brackets, no nothing. There are only three commands.

10:56.620 --> 11:04.880
There's print for output and then there's ask and echo. Ask for input and echo is another

11:04.880 --> 11:12.880
way of producing output. It produces the word, the text behind it and then followed by the

11:12.880 --> 11:25.520
input. So if I run this, what is your name? And my name is Mark. And it says hello, Mark.

11:25.520 --> 11:32.440
This is fun already. If it's not fun enough, they can actually have it spoken to.

11:32.440 --> 11:43.720
Your name. Hello, Mark. And imagine a classroom full of 25 kids producing things like this.

11:43.720 --> 11:51.280
And within a few seconds you're hearing, Mark is stupid and they're having a lot of fun

11:51.280 --> 12:04.320
in a whole hour. With only three commands, they're having fun. As soon as they stop laughing,

12:04.320 --> 12:10.160
or usually the next hour, the next lesson, the next lesson, the week later, we introduce

12:10.160 --> 12:17.880
variables. This is probably the toughest part of programming. To kids, at least. At least

12:17.880 --> 12:26.520
that's what I found. You can label things. Name is Hadi, age is 15, print name is eight

12:26.520 --> 12:34.240
years old. I can run this code and it produces Hadi is 15 years old. They can play around

12:34.240 --> 12:43.560
with this. They can create actually pretty nice programs. They're actually busy for another

12:43.560 --> 12:55.040
hour. Sometimes two. Until they hit a snatch. Sometimes some of the kids find out that if

12:55.040 --> 13:02.680
I ask what is your name and they produce so your name is name, most programmers will probably

13:02.680 --> 13:08.160
realize oh, no, now we have a problem. Yeah. There's one name that I want to produce as

13:08.160 --> 13:15.000
text and there's one name that I want to as variable. I can never, ever use the text anymore.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.080
This is a learning opportunity. We can actually say okay, we have to make a distinction between

13:22.080 --> 13:27.240
these. If I mean text, I put quotation marks around it. Ah, okay, that's a smart thing.

13:27.240 --> 13:39.040
It's like they invented it themselves. Let them think so. It's gradual and it's 18 levels

13:39.040 --> 13:48.400
and at the end you're speaking fluent Python. That's the gradual part. It's also multilingual.

13:48.400 --> 13:57.960
Why? Well, we asked kids do you like Hadi? There was a small study. There's a paper about

13:57.960 --> 14:04.560
it. It's in the slide deck at the end. There was only 39 kids in 12 online lessons. This

14:04.560 --> 14:09.960
was corona time. We asked them what are the benefits, the challenges and the improvements.

14:09.960 --> 14:18.080
These were the kids of Fellina's classes and they said well, it's great that it's stepwise.

14:18.080 --> 14:27.440
I can excel level by level and I can follow on. The teachers that actually work with it

14:27.440 --> 14:35.400
are usually normal teachers. They're not programmers. They teach for the first time programming.

14:35.400 --> 14:43.080
They don't even know programming. They liked it and they said oh well, all kids, my whole

14:43.080 --> 14:48.520
class is learning programming. Of course there are some kids that say you're going to be

14:48.520 --> 14:55.320
a programmer but the rest is still dragging along. Some of the teachers said even the

14:55.320 --> 15:00.560
girls now have the confidence to become a programmer. It's something they mentioned

15:00.560 --> 15:06.040
out of their cells. What do they want? They want some improvements. First of all, they

15:06.040 --> 15:14.760
want better error messages. We had very good error messages. I'll show you one. You cannot

15:14.760 --> 15:23.600
read this but it says you typed comma but that is not allowed. We put a comma here as

15:23.600 --> 15:31.040
a comma between quotes. Remember these are kids of 10 year olds and they just learned

15:31.040 --> 15:36.840
that if there's a comma in the sentence they pause. They read you typed but that's not

15:36.840 --> 15:48.880
allowed. Why cannot I type? We had to change that in you typed a comma but that's not allowed.

15:48.880 --> 15:57.440
Almost all of those well thought of error messages weren't well thought of after all.

15:57.440 --> 16:05.880
How they are and they wanted something really weird. They wanted Dutch keywords. Well, we're

16:05.880 --> 16:11.080
in the Netherlands so it's not weird they want Dutch but why? Everybody's coding in

16:11.080 --> 16:25.880
English. Print is the same in Dutch. Echo is the same but why? Let's look at the demo.

16:25.880 --> 16:50.480
Let's see a nice error message. Print hello world with a capital P. It says print is not

16:50.480 --> 16:56.120
a command in level one. Did you mean print? The first one is a capital P and the last

16:56.120 --> 17:10.800
one is a small P. Maybe it gets even better. If I put a space in front of it, it runs.

17:10.800 --> 17:16.520
But it gives me a warning. Oops. You started a line with a space on line one. Spaces confuse

17:16.520 --> 17:30.640
me. Can you remove it? There's plenty of time to correct these ideas. I don't know. I should

17:30.640 --> 17:42.280
change that. Then there's translation. I'm in English now. I can move to 45 languages

17:42.280 --> 17:51.480
like Dutch. Yes, I want to reload. Now this whole program, every text, almost everything

17:51.480 --> 18:01.160
is in Dutch except for ask. Ask was by the way the main reason they wanted it in Dutch

18:01.160 --> 18:08.200
because in Dutch we don't usually have the S and the K so near one another. They write

18:08.200 --> 18:17.800
X and it's a weird letter combination. There's a toggle where you can say I want to change

18:17.800 --> 18:27.200
the commands in Dutch as well. Now everything is in Dutch. I can ask for the ones we don't

18:27.200 --> 18:34.120
speak Dutch. That's the same as what's your name. It's still Mark. Hello, Mark. It works

18:34.120 --> 18:47.360
even in Dutch. Once we had this, we realized that people were in India using Hindi, Thai,

18:47.360 --> 18:56.140
Chinese, Arab. It's all those kids are just like in the Netherlands. They're just learning

18:56.140 --> 19:05.640
a language. They don't know a P if they see one. To us, to me, these are images. These

19:05.640 --> 19:10.080
are not letters. I cannot read this. I can copy paste some of this but I cannot read

19:10.080 --> 19:18.880
this. The same is true for them. They cannot read these letters. They should be able to

19:18.880 --> 19:31.000
put them into Arabic as well. This works, of course, I hope. I cannot check. Maybe I'm

19:31.000 --> 19:48.840
cursing now. I guess it works. That's why it's multilingual. It's for the kids. Yes,

19:48.840 --> 19:54.840
at the end, in level 18, we do tell them you better put it in English now. You know what

19:54.840 --> 20:00.560
it all means but you better start using English now. From now on, no more Dutch or Arabic

20:00.560 --> 20:15.720
or whatever. They're old enough to do that. It's built for teaching. It's built for teachers

20:15.720 --> 20:22.680
as well as students. They like that the levels are step by step a guide. There's only small

20:22.680 --> 20:29.600
thing they have to learn and the rest is not even possible. The teachers that do not know

20:29.600 --> 20:36.520
programming but are teaching programming but using Hetty, they think, oh, I can do this.

20:36.520 --> 20:45.320
This is not overwhelming. When I was using Scratch for the first time in a coded dojo,

20:45.320 --> 20:52.840
I had to think of a program they could make. What can my students make? There's a lot of

20:52.840 --> 20:59.320
examples on the Internet. I need to do research. I need to find the right thing and if I'm

20:59.320 --> 21:07.460
planning a 20-day course, somewhere in level of day 18, I'm probably going to mess up something

21:07.460 --> 21:15.300
I did in level 17. It's going to cost me time to get things right. I can find the

21:15.300 --> 21:19.600
right one or that one or that one. If I'm not a real programmer, if I'm not very good

21:19.600 --> 21:25.520
at it myself, which one should I take? If I choose one, I print it out, I hand it over

21:25.520 --> 21:31.240
to my students and they open up Scratch and they start looking at Scratch and they start

21:31.240 --> 21:36.280
looking at the lesson again, at the paper and they look at Scratch again. What was that?

21:36.280 --> 21:45.920
They have to contact-switch over and over again. I see the students getting a little

21:45.920 --> 21:53.680
distracted. I don't remember what was it. They're very impatient species, children.

21:53.680 --> 22:02.760
We invented adventures. I'll show you in the last demo because the time is ticking away.

22:02.760 --> 22:07.800
Then there is class management. That's the last thing I want to talk about, class management

22:07.800 --> 22:15.800
as in there's a whole different type of kids in the class. There's this type that actually

22:15.800 --> 22:25.600
read the paper, reproduced it in Scratch and tells the teacher, look, I did it. It just

22:25.600 --> 22:31.600
wants a pattern of a bag. Yeah, it's right. In five minutes, they produce a mowing, running

22:31.600 --> 22:37.440
around cat. It's lovely and they did it. The other one, and there are quite a few, they

22:37.440 --> 22:46.920
drag just one thing on the screen, which I do now. Well, you could read the paper again.

22:46.920 --> 22:54.920
I don't get it. Then there's this type, probably the level of Olivier, they would probably

22:54.920 --> 23:01.520
produce something they want recognition for. They did this in five minutes as well because

23:01.520 --> 23:08.040
they've been doing this for years at home. Now they want my help to get some synchronized

23:08.040 --> 23:16.560
legs on the bottom of this Robin Hood. Once it run, I don't even know how to do that.

23:16.560 --> 23:22.720
At least I can call Olivier now and help me out in this block programming. All these kids

23:22.720 --> 23:34.920
are in the same class. I want them to move along about the same page. What was it? Base,

23:34.920 --> 23:45.880
that's it. So we created something we call customization. First of all, let's put this

23:45.880 --> 24:04.280
back into English. Let's see me in action. This is my account. As you have seen before,

24:04.280 --> 24:10.960
maybe there are some tabs on the top of this. This is what we call adventures. There are

24:10.960 --> 24:18.200
maybe 10, 15 different adventures. They come along every level, 18 levels along. They can

24:18.200 --> 24:24.320
do rock, paper, scissors. First of all, it's just printing and at the end it's deciding

24:24.320 --> 24:30.200
who won and playing against the computer and three players against, etc. So it's getting

24:30.200 --> 24:38.200
more progressively difficult, but it's still the same program. As a teacher, I only have

24:38.200 --> 24:46.920
to know 10 programs and it's all in view. I can just click on, I want to do the story

24:46.920 --> 24:54.000
and I code it here. So for the kids, there is no context switching of paper or thing.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.400
Then there's this teacher that can do, oh, teacher. Is this the teacher version? Where

25:03.400 --> 25:11.640
is the teacher version? But I should be logged in in any of them. No, I'm not logged in in

25:11.640 --> 25:30.560
any of them now. Why am I no longer logged in? I don't know my password because that's

25:30.560 --> 25:58.920
very secure. So I need last pass and I cancelled everything. Oh well. How many minutes have

25:58.920 --> 26:11.600
I left? Okay, that will work. What am I doing now?

26:28.920 --> 26:50.040
Yes.

26:50.040 --> 26:56.720
So this is where I was. I thought I was at my page. There is, if you're a teacher, you

26:56.720 --> 27:00.960
can just request to become a teacher only, even if you're only teaching your own two

27:00.960 --> 27:06.480
kids, you can actually become a teacher. And then there's this for teachers page and there's

27:06.480 --> 27:13.060
a complete teacher manual. And there's a demo class in which I am a student. I can look

27:13.060 --> 27:18.000
at some statistics. How many errors did I produce? At what level am I? What kind of

27:18.000 --> 27:23.360
errors did I produce? How many successful programs? How many errors programs? And I

27:23.360 --> 27:31.160
can customize the class. I can switch on and off all the levels. And what I do in real

27:31.160 --> 27:37.920
life, I switch them all off except for the first one. So all the class has to stay in

27:37.920 --> 27:46.600
less than one, in level one. I can automatically produce a schedule, put opening dates so they

27:46.600 --> 27:54.880
automatically open every week, for instance, I can hide and show quizzes and puzzles. There's

27:54.880 --> 28:00.240
a person puzzle at the end of all the adventures. And there's a quiz at the end 10 questions.

28:00.240 --> 28:09.000
And I can ask if I can set this class to minimum quiz score of 80 before they can advance to

28:09.000 --> 28:22.600
the next level. So if I save this and go to the other one. Oh, wow. Now it accidentally

28:22.600 --> 28:36.440
logged in. I think it's because I have two of the same browsers now. Mark and class.

28:36.440 --> 28:50.120
This one's not a secret. If I go to this now, you can see there's a lot less. Only two.

28:50.120 --> 28:59.000
So this class only has two adventures. It has a puzzle and a quiz. And they cannot go

28:59.000 --> 29:11.720
to level two unless they made the quiz until with 18 points, 80% of points. Okay, that's

29:11.720 --> 29:18.600
customization. That's about it. Heady, it's called it's named after heavy Lamar, who knows

29:18.600 --> 29:28.680
heavy Lamar. Oh, that's a lot of world famous actress, and a world infamous inventor. We're

29:28.680 --> 29:35.080
still using a lot of our inventions. And of course, we're open source. We love your help.

29:35.080 --> 29:40.960
If you think, ah, this is a good idea. And I'd like to work on an innovative gradual

29:40.960 --> 29:51.200
parser. Actually, actually quite a feat. There's a paper about it. And it tells you a little

29:51.200 --> 30:01.480
bit about an EVNF extension that we can merge partial grammars. We actually want help in

30:01.480 --> 30:07.200
multilingual language. Like I said, we have 45 languages, and these are 45 languages.

30:07.200 --> 30:13.760
As you can see, English is pretty well. And Dutch is pretty well. There's some other languages

30:13.760 --> 30:23.720
are blue. We love help making all these ones as green as it. And of course, we want you

30:23.720 --> 30:30.040
to help teachers. So go to your schools in the neighborhood and tell teachers about them.

30:30.040 --> 30:39.360
And maybe help them get along get started. Once they get started. It's like oil it spreads.

30:39.360 --> 30:45.760
I'm only teaching 40 kids now if I was I was teaching 40 teachers. That would go a lot

30:45.760 --> 30:54.000
faster. There are some building videos for teachers. And this is where you can join.

30:54.000 --> 31:10.360
Thank you very much.
