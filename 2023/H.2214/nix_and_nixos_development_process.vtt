00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
Hey, everyone.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.160
And so, yes, Brian introduced me.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.160
I'm Telfan.

00:14.160 --> 00:19.560
I'm a member of the Nix OS Foundation board, but I'm not going to talk about that today

00:19.560 --> 00:22.280
because I'm also a Nix maintainer.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.840
I have been a Nix maintainer for the last few months.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.040
And I'm going to talk about the Nix package manager team, officially called the Nix team,

00:30.040 --> 00:35.120
but it's very confusing, so I won't call it like that, at least not in the first slide,

00:35.120 --> 00:41.760
which is a team that has spawned a few months ago to actually expand a bit on the maintenance

00:41.760 --> 00:43.240
of Nix.

00:43.240 --> 00:52.680
The reason why we created this team is that Nix in some ways had a bad reputation, both

00:52.680 --> 00:58.840
for contributors and for users, with this idea that the maintenance of Nix didn't care

00:58.840 --> 01:06.720
about contributors and users, which is not great for a product, and it's not great for

01:06.720 --> 01:08.440
an open source product.

01:08.440 --> 01:13.240
So to be fair, that's not true.

01:13.240 --> 01:18.600
Slightly less wrong amended version would be that the single Nix maintainer doesn't

01:18.600 --> 01:23.880
have the bandwidth to care about all that because it's one guy hacking on a fairly big

01:23.880 --> 01:25.960
project for a bit of history.

01:25.960 --> 01:33.800
If you don't know Nix originally, that was a PhD project that Elko Dolstra started.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.120
And then it has grown up progressively.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.240
The community has expanded.

01:40.240 --> 01:46.880
But until recently, that was still only maintained by Elko Dolstra as one person, which was definitely

01:46.880 --> 01:51.480
not enough for something of that size.

01:51.480 --> 01:58.080
But regardless of the fact that it's not someone not caring about anything, it's really more

01:58.080 --> 02:04.000
of an organizational problem, well, that's not great.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
That's not great for a number of reasons.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.040
So as I said, contributors didn't really feel like they were as appreciated as they should

02:13.040 --> 02:20.560
have been, a lot of pull requests stayed unanswered for a long time or forever.

02:20.560 --> 02:27.720
Even when they were answered, there was no guarantee that you could get an actual yes

02:27.720 --> 02:33.680
or no answer to is this pull request something that's going to be met eventually.

02:33.680 --> 02:39.320
There was also no way for contributors to know before the fact whether what they were

02:39.320 --> 02:43.760
doing could fit the Nix style guide because there was one.

02:43.760 --> 02:48.760
There still is one, but only one person knew it.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.920
And so as a contributor, that was really, it was really tough to contribute to Nix because

02:53.920 --> 02:59.200
of all these kind of little things.

02:59.200 --> 03:07.240
And another problem, which is more something for the users, is that the release process

03:07.240 --> 03:10.360
of Nix was a bit chaotic.

03:10.360 --> 03:17.600
So the 2.3 release of Nix was somewhere around 2018.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.760
Anyway, don't remember the exact dates.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.680
But then Nix went for two years with the actual release.

03:24.680 --> 03:31.040
And when the 2.4 release came, I just made some quick stats and I'm going to show up

03:31.040 --> 03:32.200
the interesting numbers.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.880
So Nix was 55,000 lines of C++ at that time.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.240
Well, only counting the implementation files.

03:40.240 --> 03:47.200
And the diff between the 2.3 and 2.4 release was 32 new lines or lines changed.

03:47.200 --> 03:51.440
So essentially half of Nix had been rewritten between the two releases.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.120
And yeah, as you can guess, that came with a number of breakages.

03:56.120 --> 04:02.560
Honestly, very few breakages given the size of the diff, but still way enough to annoy

04:02.560 --> 04:03.560
users.

04:03.560 --> 04:10.400
A lot of, regardless of the breakages, new features had been introduced, but not necessarily

04:10.400 --> 04:12.720
properly documented.

04:12.720 --> 04:18.040
Or experimental features had been added and were officially experimental, but that was

04:18.040 --> 04:20.680
not properly communicated.

04:20.680 --> 04:25.720
So people started relying on them as if they were actually stuff that you could use for

04:25.720 --> 04:31.560
production and then they got changed because they were just experimental and people got

04:31.560 --> 04:34.200
angry about that.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.600
I mean, rightfully from the point of view, unrightfully from the point of view of the

04:38.600 --> 04:43.880
maintenance for which these were experimental, you should just not rely on them.

04:43.880 --> 04:50.320
But anyway, that led to a lot of frustration and that has been going on for a long time.

04:50.320 --> 04:57.560
I think we could say that Nix has started being really a big enough project since the

04:57.560 --> 05:03.800
early 2010s and it has kept growing ever since.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.160
So the frustration has kept growing with that.

05:08.160 --> 05:16.520
So in 2018, a group of people just sat together and decided that this just couldn't keep going.

05:16.520 --> 05:23.560
And so they decided to create the Nix core team whose responsibility was exactly this,

05:23.560 --> 05:28.240
like improve the maintenance of Nix, make it clear what design decisions are, where

05:28.240 --> 05:35.080
the project is going, what contributors can expect from them and what we expect from contributions

05:35.080 --> 05:39.640
so that we could smoothen all that.

05:39.640 --> 05:47.240
So this core team was a great idea, but at least to me at that time, I wasn't that much

05:47.240 --> 05:49.120
involved in Nix at that time.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.880
I was only a user and very casual contributor.

05:51.880 --> 06:00.640
The main contribution for the Nix core team that I saw was one year later, another announcement

06:00.640 --> 06:07.320
that the core team was disbanded because it hadn't done anything meaningful in that year.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.280
So yeah, that was unfortunately a bit of a failure.

06:12.280 --> 06:23.480
Now, well, then in the meantime, I came to contribute more and more to Nix.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.880
It also happened that Elko and I got colleagues for some time, which really helped smoothen

06:28.880 --> 06:34.200
things a lot for my contributions because I could just ping him and say, hey, Elko,

06:34.200 --> 06:38.400
I have this pull request, can you please review it?

06:38.400 --> 06:43.640
That was really helpful, but unfortunately, well, maybe fortunately, I guess that depends,

06:43.640 --> 06:51.760
but not everyone got to be Elko's colleagues, so that model couldn't really scale.

06:51.760 --> 06:59.360
And yeah, at some point we thought, well, we need to do something and maybe try again

06:59.360 --> 07:04.040
what that Nix core team, well, didn't manage to do.

07:04.040 --> 07:09.840
But then the big question is, well, how can we succeed if that core team failed?

07:09.840 --> 07:14.960
And like for the record, that team, if you look at the core others here, these were the

07:14.960 --> 07:18.440
biggest members of the Nix community at that time.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.960
That was not just a group of random people showing up and saying, hey, we want to maintain

07:21.960 --> 07:23.760
Nix.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.280
That was really a big community effort.

07:26.280 --> 07:34.000
So how could we make something that works and why maybe could we make it work now?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.840
So, I maybe expand a bit later on the how.

07:37.840 --> 07:43.480
The first question is, well, the first thing is that the circumstances were actually very

07:43.480 --> 07:46.960
different.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.000
If you look, so I dig the bit in the GitHub history stats.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.880
This is very blurry, but that way you won't be tempted to read all the numbers and you

07:55.880 --> 07:58.600
will just show the big shape of the graph.

07:58.600 --> 08:05.080
So these are the main committers between 2003 and 2020.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.560
So that graph represents Elko's contributions.

08:08.560 --> 08:14.560
And this very, very, very, very tiny graph that, yeah, I can see that one.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.360
It's not smaller than the pixels on the screen, but barely.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.540
So these are the other main contributors.

08:21.540 --> 08:27.980
So as you can see, well, that's really a one person project with some contributors.

08:27.980 --> 08:32.920
If we look between 2021 and 2023, and I'm probably getting out of the camera field,

08:32.920 --> 08:35.040
so I'm going to stay where I am.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.920
Well, you can see that, well, Elko is still the main contributor.

08:38.920 --> 08:39.920
That's no question about that.

08:39.920 --> 08:44.280
But then things are much more well distributed after that.

08:44.280 --> 08:50.160
So that means that there's actually people who potentially are already investing enough

08:50.160 --> 08:55.280
time in Nix and could really take on a maintenance ship.

08:55.280 --> 09:04.520
And another key ingredient that also probably was missing at the time is that between 2018

09:04.520 --> 09:11.880
and today, well, the Nix community has kept growing and we have more and more industrial

09:11.880 --> 09:17.480
players in that community and more and more people who are paid to work on Nix.

09:17.480 --> 09:26.200
And Elko has the chance of always having been paid to work on Nix more or less, first as

09:26.200 --> 09:32.520
a PhD student, then getting hired by a company, which gave him a lot of time to hack on it.

09:32.520 --> 09:39.480
And so for a long time, he was mostly the only one, at least for Nix itself.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.680
But yeah, now things are changing.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.600
We're kind of growing up.

09:43.600 --> 09:49.840
We're a real community of people actually handling money and having people who have

09:49.840 --> 09:55.800
time to do this kind of boring and painful things of all reviewing pull requests of code

09:55.800 --> 09:57.800
that someone else wrote.

09:57.800 --> 10:05.400
And obviously, I didn't write it myself, so it's not good and I don't want to read it.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.720
But now we can leverage that.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.580
And so that's what we did.

10:09.580 --> 10:16.120
So we gathered a group of people, we sat together with Elko and the other, well, people who

10:16.120 --> 10:21.720
would be like, who are now team members of that team.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.480
Everyone agreed that this was a great idea.

10:23.480 --> 10:27.240
We had a lot of disagreements on the tiny detail because obviously that's how things

10:27.240 --> 10:29.820
go.

10:29.820 --> 10:35.740
But eventually we found that team, we announced it officially saying, hey, yeah, everyone agrees

10:35.740 --> 10:36.740
that there's problems.

10:36.740 --> 10:42.720
So we are just going to create a team to try and solve these problems.

10:42.720 --> 10:50.200
We set a simple but ambitious goal for the team, which was to basically take ownership

10:50.200 --> 11:00.400
of that Nix source code and lead it to both to better, to higher standards, both for contributors

11:00.400 --> 11:04.960
and for the end-users so that contributors could know that their contributions would

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
be taken into account.

11:05.960 --> 11:11.320
Oh, no, that they wouldn't in case these weren't things that we thought should land into Nix.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.160
Actually, they should have clarity.

11:13.160 --> 11:19.960
And the users should know that Nix was something that they could rely on that was robust, that

11:19.960 --> 11:28.160
fixes were made in time, that they had clear expectations and the support they could get.

11:28.160 --> 11:39.000
And because Nix starts to be reasonably big, we also thought that a single team of four

11:39.000 --> 11:45.200
or five people, well, that's already better than a team of one person.

11:45.200 --> 11:51.160
But that's still not enough really to manage the size of the Nix code base.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
Not so much the size.

11:52.160 --> 11:58.920
The base is not that big, but the vitality and the amount of pull requests and issues

11:58.920 --> 12:00.400
that come in.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.440
So we decided that the first mean by which we would want to take ownership of that code

12:05.440 --> 12:14.580
was to actually enable more maintainers and contributors by writing some clear contributing

12:14.580 --> 12:20.880
guides so that people knew what to expect by trying and grow more maintainers out of

12:20.880 --> 12:27.480
the existing contributors by so that we would not be a bottleneck for someone having his

12:27.480 --> 12:35.040
pull request answered.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.440
And as part of that stewardship also, we...

12:39.440 --> 12:43.960
Oh, I forgot a bit of history.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.840
So this was the main step towards that.

12:47.840 --> 12:54.920
But actually someone decided to bite the bullet on another topic some month earlier.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.640
And yeah, same thing.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.880
People sat down together and decided, well, the Nix release process is not great.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.840
We need to improve that.

13:03.840 --> 13:06.360
Well, let's just have a fixed schedule.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.120
One release every six weeks.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.200
That's arbitrary.

13:10.200 --> 13:14.560
Probably half of this rule would say, well, this is a bad way of doing releases.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.440
You could just send another half would say, well, this is a bad way of doing things.

13:18.440 --> 13:24.480
Just do leave hat head and the other half might agree.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.320
But anyway, everyone agreed that having that was better than nothing.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.960
Oh, and I'm talking too much.

13:31.960 --> 13:37.000
But then this release schedule also was something that was still in Elko's hands.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.800
And that like doing a release is not a big deal, but you have to think about it.

13:41.800 --> 13:48.200
And if you're the only one who's tasked every six weeks to do that, well, certainly, please

13:48.200 --> 13:51.040
don't go on vacation that the date of the release because otherwise you're going to

13:51.040 --> 13:52.680
annoy everything.

13:52.680 --> 13:56.560
And please don't forget about it because then you are going to have 20 people yelling at

13:56.560 --> 13:58.620
you because you're three days late.

13:58.620 --> 14:08.680
So that team was also a way to share a bit this responsibility.

14:08.680 --> 14:16.040
And well, the big question then is, did we succeed?

14:16.040 --> 14:18.160
I hope so.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.000
I really, really hope so.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.360
So I don't think I gave you the date already, but we started all that last September, which

14:29.360 --> 14:32.360
means that we are six months in.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.600
And six months in, it's still a bit tough to see.

14:35.600 --> 14:44.080
The main indicator I have to think that probably we've succeeded is that we've turned the Nix

14:44.080 --> 14:49.440
commit tree into something that starts to look like a plausible metro map, which is

14:49.440 --> 14:55.120
always a good thing when you're maintaining an open source project.

14:55.120 --> 15:01.800
But in addition to that, for some less tangible factors, I think that the team is going reasonably

15:01.800 --> 15:12.400
well and Nix is starting to move forward at a more sustainable and pre-visible pace, which

15:12.400 --> 15:15.760
makes me very, very hopeful for the future.

15:15.760 --> 15:23.400
And just adding two minutes to expand a bit on that because this Nix team is not an isolated

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
phenomenon.

15:24.400 --> 15:31.220
It's part of a growing movement within the Nix community to try and structure the fundamentals

15:31.220 --> 15:36.720
of the ecosystem, starting with something that Domaine briefly mentioned, which was

15:36.720 --> 15:42.960
the Nix OS Foundation board, which got expanded a few months ago to try and be more proactive

15:42.960 --> 15:53.040
within the community and expand on his previous role, which was mostly pay for the infrastructure.

15:53.040 --> 15:57.920
And this also materialized with the emergence of a lot of different teams, the marketing

15:57.920 --> 16:04.040
team, which was created a bit more than a year ago, then a team dedicated on the documentation,

16:04.040 --> 16:08.160
which I think nearly every speaker here at some point say that the documentation is a

16:08.160 --> 16:09.700
problem for Nix.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.760
So everyone agrees that this is a problem.

16:11.760 --> 16:18.240
Another team that got created around the maintenance of Nix packages, which is like, correct me,

16:18.240 --> 16:23.320
but I think that's the seventh more active GitHub repo.

16:23.320 --> 16:29.480
And well, when you have something of that size, you'd better not have it just be something

16:29.480 --> 16:36.640
informally maintained by whoever happens to pass by and want to make some changes.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.920
And so all that is part of a big community movement towards organizing these kind of

16:41.920 --> 16:46.960
things, which makes me very happy and very hopeful for the future of the Nix community

16:46.960 --> 16:49.000
in general.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.080
And since I want to leave some time for questions, I'm going to stop right here.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.560
And if you want to know more after that, we can always have a chat or contact me wherever.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
Thank you.

17:00.560 --> 17:23.440
Are there any questions?

17:23.440 --> 17:24.440
That's a big question.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.440
It's all over.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.760
The question was, yeah.

17:27.760 --> 17:34.680
OK, the question was, when, if ever, will flakes be the default with a comment by someone

17:34.680 --> 17:40.920
who might not name, who say that it was an embargo, and I couldn't answer that.

17:40.920 --> 17:46.600
And so the answer, well, one answer is when it's going to be ready.

17:46.600 --> 17:54.160
And actually, so a huge part of the Nix team discussions were about refining the semantics

17:54.160 --> 18:00.800
of flakes to make sure that all the little corners that we wanted to have cut before

18:00.800 --> 18:05.080
actually making its table were cut.

18:05.080 --> 18:12.080
And so I would definitely wouldn't advance a date or a time.

18:12.080 --> 18:18.880
But it has been, it's progressing, which doesn't answer your question.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
I know.

18:19.880 --> 18:20.880
One more question.

18:20.880 --> 18:30.840
OK, in your perspective, where does FITS projects such as TDX, which are implementation of Nix,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.840
how are you going to engage with them?

18:32.840 --> 18:37.200
Are you even considering engaging with them for the Nix project?

18:37.200 --> 18:43.360
OK, so the question was how we were considering projects like TDX, which is a re-implementation

18:43.360 --> 18:49.280
of Nix, and whether we wanted to engage with them or whether we were already engaging with

18:49.280 --> 18:50.560
them.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.840
So I think I cut that in my screenshot here.

18:53.840 --> 18:59.080
But actually, one of the explicit goals of the team was to actually engage with any third

18:59.080 --> 19:02.420
party that could be interesting to engage with.

19:02.420 --> 19:09.120
That obviously included the TDX guys, which we didn't do because, well, people never do

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
what they say.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.120
You know that?

19:12.120 --> 19:16.160
Which is definitely something that we want to do.

19:16.160 --> 19:22.520
In the case of TDX in particular, for two reasons, one of them being that TDX was really

19:22.520 --> 19:26.960
born out of the very frustrations we talked to at the beginning.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.900
So it would be interesting to have their feedback on whether they feel that things are moving

19:30.900 --> 19:32.960
in the right direction.

19:32.960 --> 19:39.320
And also because, well, let's be honest, having another implementation of Nix, which is kind

19:39.320 --> 19:42.120
of a concurrence, it's a real off the pain.

19:42.120 --> 19:47.480
These people are doing what we want to do, but it's also great because they are like

19:47.480 --> 19:51.960
the TDX people came every once in a while, for example, with opening an issue saying,

19:51.960 --> 19:59.320
oh, there's this very, very weird piece of semantics in Nix when you trigger this specific

19:59.320 --> 20:00.320
code.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.600
I don't know whether that's a bug or not.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.960
I'm probably going to re-implement it for TDX because I want to be bug by bug compatible.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.840
But is this really what you intended?

20:08.840 --> 20:13.280
In general, the answer is no.

20:13.280 --> 20:19.000
But my point is that I think we would gain a lot from collaborating a bit more together.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Yeah.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
One more round of applause, please.

20:21.000 --> 20:39.520
Thank you.
