WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.240
There's too many people there.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.440
I wasn't ready for that.

00:13.440 --> 00:19.000
If they told me I would have finished my slice sooner.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.200
So yeah, thank you everyone for being there.

00:23.200 --> 00:29.240
It's really energizing to see so many people interested in Nix, NixOS.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.760
So I work at a company called Twig.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.640
My name is Guillaume.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.800
We love Nix, Twig.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.160
If you don't know about us,

00:37.160 --> 00:38.680
check out our blog, we have.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.520
So it's okay.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.720
So while my job as work is more data,

00:44.720 --> 00:47.880
science, and just software in general,

00:47.880 --> 00:49.880
I'm a Nix enthusiast.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.600
I started three years ago,

00:51.600 --> 00:54.040
could not stop since then.

00:54.040 --> 00:58.040
My rabbit hole was just managing CUDA basically.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.760
As a Nix enthusiast,

00:59.760 --> 01:04.680
I have one thing I can't stop thinking about,

01:04.680 --> 01:09.360
which is I want everyone to use Nix.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.480
I want you to use Nix,

01:10.480 --> 01:11.920
I want you to use Nix,

01:11.920 --> 01:13.960
I want you to use Nix, I want.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.600
So before I start,

01:16.600 --> 01:21.960
does anyone not use Nix on a daily basis here?

01:22.080 --> 01:24.720
Okay. So I want you to use Nix.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.800
I want you to. Okay. So,

01:28.800 --> 01:30.160
and to the other people in the room,

01:30.160 --> 01:31.200
guys, what are you doing?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.480
There's two people not using Nix.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.040
So as you might know,

01:37.040 --> 01:42.040
I want to be able to make anyone use Nix.

01:42.040 --> 01:46.480
But there is a but.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.520
In the sentence, we have both.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.800
Anyone?

01:51.800 --> 01:55.480
Nix.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.440
In the same sentence.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.080
Ideally, this is what the combination of

02:02.080 --> 02:05.000
these words should mean.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.000
Nix users know better.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.200
So Nix is not an easy tool to use.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.600
In order to be completely autonomous with Nix and NixOS,

02:19.600 --> 02:24.960
you need a vast amount of knowledge to model your way.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.200
Through all kinds of problems

02:27.200 --> 02:29.760
and before you get anything to run properly.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.480
However, I am a believer.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.880
I think we can, in fact,

02:36.880 --> 02:41.640
not have this but reach

02:41.640 --> 02:46.000
this wonderful world where everyone can use it.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.560
So let me tell you a story that happened

02:49.560 --> 02:52.880
in a company that I might have heard about.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.480
So in this company, we have Emma.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.200
Say hello to Emma. Thank you.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.480
The company didn't expect people to actually reply to that.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.840
I'm delighted that you are. Thank you.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.320
I feel less lonely there.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.360
The company being rather small,

03:08.360 --> 03:13.360
she has to handle all HR by herself because she's the HR.

03:13.520 --> 03:19.480
So she manages the employees contract as any HR would.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.240
It turns out that even though the company is small,

03:22.240 --> 03:26.400
she has processed a lot of contracts.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.600
I mean really a lot.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.880
Oops. I spent too much time on this animation.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.520
Not too good to let it go to waste. Sorry.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.720
So she has been using a software for quite some time.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.080
You might recognize the logo.

03:43.080 --> 03:48.160
To process demo and it has been going fine.

03:48.160 --> 03:54.000
But someday, a task come to her so huge is stupid.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.960
We all know this kind of stupid task.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.720
Let's say for instance that she has to go through

03:59.720 --> 04:01.760
all the contracts and find

04:01.760 --> 04:04.760
all the employees that had some specific terms.

04:04.760 --> 04:10.600
She now has to spend hours and hours and days going

04:10.600 --> 04:12.800
through all each one contract reading,

04:12.800 --> 04:14.560
looking for the terms etc etc.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.880
It's boring. It is repetitive.

04:16.880 --> 04:23.280
If only there was a way to do it without doing it manually.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.680
As she's starting to drown in her own despair,

04:28.680 --> 04:32.680
suddenly appears in her slack.

04:32.880 --> 04:37.120
Someone who says, I think I can be of help.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.920
It's an engineer, she says.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.600
Little does she know that it's not just an engineer.

04:43.600 --> 04:48.080
Anyway, our hero knows that she uses a SAS to process

04:48.080 --> 04:50.880
the contract and a SAS often has an API.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.800
So it can be automated.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.400
So he says, I can do it in minutes.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.560
Is he a spy? He puts in his hacking gloves,

04:59.560 --> 05:03.280
starts typing fursuously and am I is no.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.920
He says, give me access to your account and I will get

05:05.920 --> 05:07.440
the data on my machine and I will

05:07.440 --> 05:09.760
proceed it for you and I will pass it to you.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.760
But then Emma looks at him in fear.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.880
It's forbidden by law.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.040
Indeed, we now have to face a terrible foe.

05:18.040 --> 05:24.400
GDPR. You should not have access to this data or will be in trouble.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.760
There were these close to solving the problem.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.320
But our hero knows that it ain't easy to run

05:31.320 --> 05:33.920
a custom script on Novice computer.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.320
You would have to grow through many challenges.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.680
Making someone use a terminal,

05:39.680 --> 05:42.040
installing dependencies,

05:42.040 --> 05:46.040
sending the code and most of it all fixing it

05:46.040 --> 05:49.200
because it never works on the first trial.

05:49.200 --> 05:54.120
So if only there was a simple way to run

05:54.120 --> 05:58.720
a program on someone computer without such hassle.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.240
If only there was.

06:02.240 --> 06:06.880
But fortunately for us, there's Nix.

06:06.880 --> 06:17.080
A single flat road for the user. So step one, install Nix.

06:21.320 --> 06:25.480
Step two, give her one liner to run a program.

06:25.480 --> 06:30.800
Actually, this one. First one, you got the joke.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.800
But it's beautiful and as you can imagine,

06:33.800 --> 06:36.040
this is sort of a true story.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.400
There really was an HR,

06:38.400 --> 06:42.600
there really was a company and I can say it out loud,

06:42.600 --> 06:44.320
I got HR to use Nix.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.800
The command I just put you.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.840
Yeah, I really do consider it an achievement.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.400
I put it in my tiles.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.560
If only it could be displayed over my head.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.240
So when I submitted my talk,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.680
I put the subtitle and you've seen it on

07:05.680 --> 07:08.480
the first slide, it will be fine.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.960
When I wrote it a month ago,

07:09.960 --> 07:12.120
it was supposed to be sarcastic, ironic,

07:12.120 --> 07:15.320
but I was supposed to roast Nix.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.200
I'm in a toxic relationship as you can see.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.040
But when I thought about this one story,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.400
I realized that in fact,

07:23.400 --> 07:28.920
it did work and that was what was incredible at the time.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.120
I was just writing a script,

07:30.120 --> 07:33.600
a Python script in five and shipping Python,

07:33.600 --> 07:37.120
I've done it to some other people for the same reason,

07:37.120 --> 07:40.320
like privacy and it's always nightmare

07:40.320 --> 07:42.360
because people really wanted to work on

07:42.360 --> 07:45.720
the machine and you can't touch it and stuff like that.

07:45.720 --> 07:50.880
So this illustrates why I love Nix.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.800
It just works.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.040
Machines are capricious,

07:56.040 --> 08:02.120
but Nix makes like a highway for us to make things run on them.

08:02.120 --> 08:07.760
It pays the way for software to not just work on my machine,

08:07.760 --> 08:11.120
but on any machine and I think this is

08:11.120 --> 08:14.080
what makes Nix have such an impact.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.600
If Nix can just do that,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.880
it's already quite enough.

08:21.040 --> 08:25.000
Is it sometimes a pain to write packages,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.840
to have to debug them because you're

08:27.840 --> 08:31.080
using a recursive function that at the end doesn't work and

08:31.080 --> 08:33.440
you have really not the good error message?

08:33.440 --> 08:35.600
Yes, sure, it is a pain to use.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.000
But at the end of the day,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.920
if it's the only way we have to do what I just did,

08:40.920 --> 08:44.440
then isn't it worth it? Do you know it?

08:44.440 --> 08:49.560
So my final word would be to all Nixers here,

08:49.560 --> 08:54.760
let's not make other people use Nix because it's cool tech.

08:54.760 --> 09:00.920
Let's make it because it makes someone else life cooler. Thank you.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.280
Thank you.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.560
So I have my minutes left.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.560
It was just a silly story to get you to breathe a bit between

09:13.560 --> 09:17.680
the interesting parts but if you have any questions.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.880
We do have questions.

09:20.880 --> 09:27.840
In which company does HJr not use Windows?

09:27.840 --> 09:34.040
So the question is,

09:34.040 --> 09:36.520
in which company does HJr not use Windows?

09:36.520 --> 09:42.320
Which is a great tricky question that I did on purpose to,

09:42.320 --> 09:45.760
yeah, it was on my quest as you could have seen.

09:45.760 --> 09:51.040
It was for some companies I guess.

09:51.040 --> 09:57.600
Yeah? Yeah?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.320
Do you use Windows?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.120
Sorry?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.480
I see you use Windows.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.920
I'm sorry. So the question is,

10:04.920 --> 10:08.840
why do I use Windows because I can run NixOS on it anyway?

10:08.840 --> 10:12.400
Some software just don't work yet.

10:12.400 --> 10:17.000
If you can make Ableton work on NixOS, I'm taking it.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.680
Still questions, how many minutes left? Yeah?

10:21.680 --> 10:26.600
We have a few HJr to run Nix to run your script.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.600
So why don't you for example use Nix to build an OCI image

10:29.600 --> 10:31.880
and run for a proper container?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.640
That's a very good question.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.560
This is, sorry?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.760
Oh yeah. So the question is, sorry.

10:37.760 --> 10:42.440
Why didn't I just build a Docker image basically to run it?

10:42.440 --> 10:46.040
This is what I did a few years ago when I had to

10:46.040 --> 10:49.840
ship Python and it turns out that Docker was a pain

10:49.840 --> 10:55.320
to use on someone's computer because there are too many buttons.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.880
Docker desktop to get running on someone's machine that just

10:59.880 --> 11:02.880
don't know or want to know how Docker works.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.640
Sometimes just like you have to turn it on,

11:05.640 --> 11:07.640
you have to wait for it to,

11:07.640 --> 11:12.760
it's too complex to hear it in this situation.

11:12.760 --> 11:17.960
Or you can argue against that but in my case it turns out to be.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.600
I wanted to use Nix to be fair.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.080
A lot of problem statement,

11:23.080 --> 11:26.960
you said that you need to teach the HR person command line,

11:26.960 --> 11:30.160
package manager, app N and then execute the script.

11:30.160 --> 11:33.640
Now, Nix kind of solved three of those things,

11:33.640 --> 11:35.120
you still need the command line.

11:35.120 --> 11:35.880
Yeah.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.240
Yes. Yeah.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.840
So, so the question is,

11:41.840 --> 11:44.400
I'm sorry I just can't get that in my head.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.480
Thank you. So the question is,

11:47.480 --> 11:50.880
so yeah, I said there were different parts of the problem to

11:50.880 --> 11:54.720
solve like installing dependencies and moving the scripts

11:54.720 --> 11:59.600
and getting people to use the command line to run the script etc.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.520
So, but there's still the fact that we need to use the terminal.

12:04.520 --> 12:11.800
I bypass that by giving things just to copy and paste.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.400
Basically.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.200
Then terminal on Mac isn't that hard to find actually.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.280
It wasn't the hardest part.

12:20.280 --> 12:25.720
The hardest parts were getting the API key from the SaaS.

12:25.720 --> 12:31.000
Because you have to make people click through the UI of the SaaS.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.840
Yeah. I think that's about it.

12:33.840 --> 12:42.360
Thank you everyone.
