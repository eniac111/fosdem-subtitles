Okay, everyone. So we are just here to wrap up the dev room. And we have a couple of last

00:15.080 --> 00:24.720
sentence just to share with you. First, well, it was awesome to have you here. And sorry,

00:24.720 --> 00:37.720
join the conversation on the Fosdom channel on Kotlin Slack. There is where basically we

00:37.720 --> 00:44.600
announced the call for paper, we announced there will be a dev room. Also, we do have some

00:44.600 --> 00:51.560
possibility to shape the dev room in a way that fits better the community. Like we could do a

00:51.560 --> 00:58.520
two-day dev room or an alpha day dev room or we could do like an alpha in person and alpha virtual.

00:58.520 --> 01:08.000
Or we could, I don't know, focus on certain topic. We try to react to the community response. So

01:08.000 --> 01:12.560
this is the channel on Kotlin Slack is public. Everyone can join. You can see the whole

01:12.560 --> 01:20.720
conversation there. Join it. And yeah, like we would love to know, like, even if you have feedback

01:20.720 --> 01:26.720
in general for this dev room this year, to share with us, we'll be more than happy to listen. And

01:26.720 --> 01:33.360
we are all there. So you will find us there. Yeah, some news on the licenses lottery.

01:33.360 --> 01:43.720
Yeah. Anything more? You asked. No, it's fine. So we have three licenses to raffle. Two of them

01:43.720 --> 01:53.800
will go out to people who were nice enough to tweet or contact us on Kotlin link. And the last

01:53.800 --> 01:59.360
one will be raffled tonight at the meetup. And I think there is somewhere a link for the...

01:59.360 --> 02:09.760
Excellent. So sign up so we know how many people to expect. And then you Nick will or Martin will

02:09.760 --> 02:20.000
do the raffle. Yeah, I'll be there. So looking forward to have some beers with you there. I just

02:20.000 --> 02:25.600
want to say a big thank you to Nico, who has been doing all the heavy lifting, like, for several

02:25.600 --> 02:31.080
months, actually, several years. He's the one who put Kotlin that first done. So thank you very much.

02:31.080 --> 02:42.920
Thank you, folks, for coming. It was always awesome. Every time I say, I should stop doing

02:42.920 --> 02:48.880
this. But then I come to Fostum and I see so many people excited to talk about Kotlin. It gives me

02:48.880 --> 02:56.360
so much joy. So I can't give up. That's why. Thank you again. And I really hope to see you in Fostum

02:56.360 --> 03:02.760
in 2024. Thank you.
