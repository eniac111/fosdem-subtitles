1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.240
So this is more of an entertaining talk, let's say.

2
0:00:09.240 --> 0:00:16.000
It's a lot less technical, probably a lot weirder, I would say.

3
0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:24.240
And hopefully I'll go fast enough so that you can have all the crazy idea questions

4
0:00:24.240 --> 0:00:25.240
at the end.

5
0:00:25.240 --> 0:00:31.240
And even a little demo, I have some hardware with me if you didn't try VR, at least I

6
0:00:31.240 --> 0:00:34.240
think today you should try this if you feel like it.

7
0:00:34.240 --> 0:00:37.760
So that will be, like, say just there where it's fresh.

8
0:00:37.760 --> 0:00:41.240
So I will...

9
0:00:41.240 --> 0:00:47.480
So those are my slides, it's a JSON file, yes, why not.

10
0:00:47.480 --> 0:00:58.040
I will start by saying that I gave a couple of workshops to kids, actually, on discovering

11
0:00:58.040 --> 0:01:00.560
VR.

12
0:01:00.560 --> 0:01:04.880
And that was pretty nice.

13
0:01:04.880 --> 0:01:09.680
I thought initially I would give workshops and give, you know, a rollercoaster.

14
0:01:09.680 --> 0:01:14.840
Some kids asked me about murdering clowns on top of a rollercoaster.

15
0:01:14.840 --> 0:01:17.120
I did not prepare this, I admit.

16
0:01:17.120 --> 0:01:20.680
But that was interesting, different inputs.

17
0:01:20.680 --> 0:01:27.000
I think it's a really interesting way also to consider teaching computer science, programming,

18
0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:31.440
because I was saying there my pine watch, like there is a computer everywhere, that's

19
0:01:31.440 --> 0:01:32.440
just a computer.

20
0:01:32.440 --> 0:01:36.760
That's why it might sound weird, it might be a little bit outside of people's comfort

21
0:01:36.760 --> 0:01:42.720
zone but in the end you can program a computer, you can program that.

22
0:01:42.720 --> 0:01:46.800
So I will introduce myself a bit first.

23
0:01:46.800 --> 0:01:56.160
So my name is Fabien, I work mostly at the UPN Parliament as a web consultant, so I just

24
0:01:56.160 --> 0:02:00.040
do VR and AR on the web, that's it.

25
0:02:00.040 --> 0:02:02.080
And I do it as a prototypist.

26
0:02:02.080 --> 0:02:09.680
So meaning all the tips you had or the suggestion you had at the beginning of the day on the

27
0:02:09.680 --> 0:02:13.560
TypeScript, on quality code, I don't know any of that.

28
0:02:13.560 --> 0:02:18.760
As I was saying before, you're chatting with somebody at the entrance, if my code runs

29
0:02:18.760 --> 0:02:21.080
during the duration of the demo, I'm happy.

30
0:02:21.080 --> 0:02:28.400
The next day, yeah, it's a bonus, but that's the length mostly.

31
0:02:28.400 --> 0:02:34.640
And I gave a couple of talks here, at first, on connecting exotic hardware, like the watch

32
0:02:34.640 --> 0:02:39.480
or IoT, everything of course using JavaScript.

33
0:02:39.480 --> 0:02:44.200
And this one will be on how to do this on a plane in a VR headset.

34
0:02:44.200 --> 0:02:51.160
So my motivation behind this is I have a bunch of notes, I have a wiki, that's the wiki,

35
0:02:51.160 --> 0:02:58.040
and I have a, you can still hear me, the 2D visualization of it, but it feels flat, like

36
0:02:58.040 --> 0:03:02.280
I don't want to have my notes in my molysceen or I don't want to have my notes behind the

37
0:03:02.280 --> 0:03:08.280
thin screen, I want them everywhere so I can play with it, like I organize the space.

38
0:03:08.280 --> 0:03:14.440
So for this, I already had a couple of versions, I used Mozilla Hubs, so a little show of hands,

39
0:03:14.440 --> 0:03:16.920
how many of you tried VR at all?

40
0:03:16.920 --> 0:03:20.920
Okay, I would say two-thirds, half two-thirds.

41
0:03:20.920 --> 0:03:23.160
How many of you tried Mozilla Hubs?

42
0:03:23.160 --> 0:03:27.200
Okay, five, six.

43
0:03:27.200 --> 0:03:35.400
So it's a social VR experiment, it's a pretty good solution, to be honest, works quite well,

44
0:03:35.400 --> 0:03:40.520
and you can do this, meaning you can be in a VR headset with your hands moving, you can

45
0:03:40.520 --> 0:03:46.480
be on laptop, on a mobile phone, and you can see this shared virtual space, it's using

46
0:03:46.480 --> 0:03:52.800
3GS for the 3D environment, and you can have PDF, you can have your webcam, you can take

47
0:03:52.800 --> 0:04:00.000
screenshots, you can honestly do pretty much most of what one would want to do.

48
0:04:00.000 --> 0:04:07.160
So I did quite a few hacks, so modification of it, it's obviously open source, that's

49
0:04:07.160 --> 0:04:13.880
the interesting part, but it's not enough, so you can do a bunch of hacks, so I explained

50
0:04:13.880 --> 0:04:18.200
a little bit how, for example, I turned on and off the lights in my office while I'm

51
0:04:18.200 --> 0:04:24.920
in VR, director kits on how to record with traveling, a bunch of different things, to

52
0:04:24.920 --> 0:04:32.640
the point that I did my little toolkit on how to customize, yeah, that's not going to

53
0:04:32.640 --> 0:04:40.760
work here, so you will have the link on the page, so imagine a bunch of functions related

54
0:04:40.760 --> 0:04:47.680
to Hubs to do all this, so I really think basically here the point is Hubs is a good

55
0:04:47.680 --> 0:04:52.840
solution, it works quite well if you want to do just social VR.

56
0:04:52.840 --> 0:04:58.840
The thing is, first of all, it doesn't work offline, and I started after the end of the

57
0:04:58.840 --> 0:05:06.200
pandemic to start to fly again to go see family, and I thought that's one of the best use cases

58
0:05:06.200 --> 0:05:10.120
for VR, like I don't like being on a plane, I don't know if you do, but I think if you're

59
0:05:10.120 --> 0:05:16.120
the pilot it's fine, but otherwise as a passenger it sucks, and one of the beauty of those things

60
0:05:16.120 --> 0:05:21.160
is you put the headset on and you're basically somewhere else, but I don't want to be in

61
0:05:21.160 --> 0:05:27.480
VR on a plane and do a roller coaster or something, I just want to code, I want to be there and

62
0:05:27.480 --> 0:05:32.600
be able to do something that I have agency over, I want to build stuff, I want to create

63
0:05:32.600 --> 0:05:38.600
things, and I don't want to be like this, I want to feel like I'm somewhere else, then

64
0:05:38.600 --> 0:05:47.280
I started to build on that, including, let's say, managing the history in my browser, so

65
0:05:47.280 --> 0:05:51.960
I would take a snapshot of the different pages that I visited, be able to organize them, the

66
0:05:51.960 --> 0:05:58.240
thing is, as you might be able to see, this doesn't look at all like Mozilla Hubs, so

67
0:05:58.240 --> 0:06:03.080
Mozilla Hubs is amazing, but it's a huge stack actually, and it's a stack that depends on

68
0:06:03.080 --> 0:06:08.880
AWS, which I obviously don't have on my plane, or the plane I'm playing with, so then I started

69
0:06:08.880 --> 0:06:13.080
to rebuild it from scratch basically.

70
0:06:13.080 --> 0:06:20.400
One warning also, when you saw it here, programming in VR, I had a discussion with somebody just

71
0:06:20.400 --> 0:06:31.480
yesterday about it, it might be productive, I would say, at some point, but that's not

72
0:06:31.480 --> 0:06:36.200
my point, I don't find that interesting, I have a really nice desk at home, it moves

73
0:06:36.200 --> 0:06:41.960
and all, and I have my ergonomic keyboard, and I can move my 4K screen, I like it, but

74
0:06:41.960 --> 0:06:47.160
I don't have that on the plane, so the point is, being able to move in space when I have

75
0:06:47.160 --> 0:06:52.520
the space, and if I don't, to be able to use the space around me in a really compact manner,

76
0:06:52.520 --> 0:06:56.760
so the point is, this whole argument is like, don't look at this presentation thinking,

77
0:06:56.760 --> 0:06:58.680
is it to replace the way I work today?

78
0:06:58.680 --> 0:07:02.640
That's not the point, it might be if you enter it, but it's more exploring what could be

79
0:07:02.640 --> 0:07:07.200
interesting in terms of interfaces, so yeah, word per minute, if you're trying to sit next

80
0:07:07.200 --> 0:07:12.080
to me with your laptop and we do a competition of how efficient you are, you're going to

81
0:07:12.080 --> 0:07:21.040
win, I mean, I hope for you, but that's not the point.

82
0:07:21.040 --> 0:07:26.440
And I was able actually on the plane to make friends, because the person next to me was

83
0:07:26.440 --> 0:07:33.680
like, what is this guy doing with his keyboard on the tray, plus there was no USB-C on it,

84
0:07:33.680 --> 0:07:40.200
so I need to plug the adapter, put it on top of the device, and then put, it was not wireless

85
0:07:40.200 --> 0:07:45.320
back then, so now I'm pretty happy, I just received this little thing, so it's a Bluetooth

86
0:07:45.320 --> 0:07:52.440
keyboard and it's, you can hear, mechanical one, that's way more efficient back then,

87
0:07:52.440 --> 0:08:00.240
I didn't have this, so yeah, that was a good excuse to meet someone and chat about what

88
0:08:00.240 --> 0:08:03.480
does it actually mean to program in VR.

89
0:08:03.480 --> 0:08:10.560
The next step being actually tinkering with it, so I went from having the history of my

90
0:08:10.560 --> 0:08:20.720
browsing behavior, let's say, to moving content and moving content by just pinching basically

91
0:08:20.720 --> 0:08:26.800
a page, so that's a render of a page, that's not a web page itself.

92
0:08:26.800 --> 0:08:32.040
What hopefully, I don't know if you can see all the way there, but basically with my right

93
0:08:32.040 --> 0:08:37.600
hand I was, I'm able to move things around, and with my left hand I'm able to execute

94
0:08:37.600 --> 0:08:42.240
code, so that's, let's say, the main trick, there was one thing you need to think about

95
0:08:42.240 --> 0:08:48.960
that presentation, it's about moving things around freely or naturally, but also you will

96
0:08:48.960 --> 0:08:56.160
see the, so I move things, the red sphere there, and then if I pinch on that piece of

97
0:08:56.160 --> 0:09:01.640
code, the sphere there is blue, so it's not just moving things around, but it starts too

98
0:09:01.640 --> 0:09:06.440
many text, which takes this code, and then code can change the environment you're inside

99
0:09:06.440 --> 0:09:10.680
of.

100
0:09:10.680 --> 0:09:24.480
And the one trick to do this, I will hide it away, but you can guess, how do I execute

101
0:09:24.480 --> 0:09:26.600
code in JavaScript?

102
0:09:26.600 --> 0:09:32.440
The one thing you're not supposed to use, evil, because it's evil, I think that's the

103
0:09:32.440 --> 0:09:36.480
one use case when you can use it, when your string of text is actually code, and you're

104
0:09:36.480 --> 0:09:42.360
not running a bank or something like this, like this is my code running on my headset,

105
0:09:42.360 --> 0:09:48.160
I don't have anything that I won't accept to break, let's say, but even then it's executing

106
0:09:48.160 --> 0:09:54.240
locally, so that's the one reason, in my opinion, to use it.

107
0:09:54.240 --> 0:10:00.640
So the idea behind it is, oh, I can manipulate text, that text can be code, I can change

108
0:10:00.640 --> 0:10:07.400
that text directly while I'm in the headset, either pinching it like single letters, or

109
0:10:07.400 --> 0:10:11.720
with a keyboard to be more efficient, and then I can execute it, which is going to change

110
0:10:11.720 --> 0:10:18.360
the whole environment I'm inside of.

111
0:10:18.360 --> 0:10:26.760
So the trick for it was basically what I like to think of, the escape valve, which is to

112
0:10:26.760 --> 0:10:31.920
say that, yeah, I could redesign an entire programming language, I could make it a programming

113
0:10:31.920 --> 0:10:38.760
language for VR, but I can also rely on one I already know, and that already has an engine

114
0:10:38.760 --> 0:10:44.600
in it, so namely JavaScript, so that's a little, let's say, trick, so I'll show a couple of

115
0:10:44.600 --> 0:10:50.480
examples, but that was an excuse not just to manipulate text and this code, but then

116
0:10:50.480 --> 0:10:55.760
to start to make my own programming language, so how many of us here have made their own

117
0:10:55.760 --> 0:10:56.760
programming language?

118
0:10:56.760 --> 0:11:03.040
Yeah, I see, I see, there are very few hands that are like this, most hands are like that,

119
0:11:03.040 --> 0:11:08.360
I'm like that too, I don't think, honestly, I feel a little bit, maybe not ashamed, but

120
0:11:08.360 --> 0:11:14.760
I'm not proud of it either, what I'm trying to convey is the endeavor, trying to do it

121
0:11:14.760 --> 0:11:19.480
is super interesting, I don't think I've learned as much recently as trying to do this.

122
0:11:19.480 --> 0:11:24.880
I also recommend, if you check the slides or the presentation after, don't learn my

123
0:11:24.880 --> 0:11:28.760
programming language, I don't think it's a good one, it's a very interesting one for

124
0:11:28.760 --> 0:11:33.240
me by building it, by seeing the limitations of my understanding of what a programming

125
0:11:33.240 --> 0:11:39.440
language is, but so this, why do I recommend this course specifically?

126
0:11:39.440 --> 0:11:44.560
It's because he's not going to, let's say, let's do an alternative to C, which for most

127
0:11:44.560 --> 0:11:49.680
of us would be too far and not practical, he's basically saying, well, JavaScript is

128
0:11:49.680 --> 0:11:55.320
a language, the browser will notice an environment you can already work with, you can transpile,

129
0:11:55.320 --> 0:12:00.240
you can use Babel, and that's enough, let's say, to get the foundation of what a programming

130
0:12:00.240 --> 0:12:01.840
language is.

131
0:12:01.840 --> 0:12:05.400
So I really recommend this kind of course if you're considering making your own programming

132
0:12:05.400 --> 0:12:06.400
language.

133
0:12:06.400 --> 0:12:20.240
And also, I don't know how many of you are familiar with this book?

134
0:12:20.240 --> 0:12:28.080
I don't think I can go back easy either.

135
0:12:28.080 --> 0:12:33.560
So yeah, if you ever try to learn, I think, the foundation of programming and programming

136
0:12:33.560 --> 0:12:39.080
languages, usually you often do it with Lisp, which works well because it's so compact that

137
0:12:39.080 --> 0:12:44.280
you can keep it all in your mind, basically.

138
0:12:44.280 --> 0:12:48.800
But again, most of us are not familiar with Lisp, and even if we are, then it's not what

139
0:12:48.800 --> 0:12:50.400
we work with on a daily basis.

140
0:12:50.400 --> 0:12:56.080
So, SAP, but the JavaScript version has been out for a couple of years now, so if you want

141
0:12:56.080 --> 0:13:02.240
to learn the foundation of a programming language while being familiar with the language itself,

142
0:13:02.240 --> 0:13:03.680
I really recommend it.

143
0:13:03.680 --> 0:13:16.000
It's quite taking, but I think it's a good investment.

144
0:13:16.000 --> 0:13:21.040
So then I'll show a couple of the features of the environment, but I won't show all of

145
0:13:21.040 --> 0:13:23.320
them, go too deep in there.

146
0:13:23.320 --> 0:13:27.360
But then what's interesting is you don't have just one line of code, but then you start

147
0:13:27.360 --> 0:13:32.880
to have groups of lines of code or history, the stack of which you executed.

148
0:13:32.880 --> 0:13:37.120
Of course, because you're in VR, code is not everything.

149
0:13:37.120 --> 0:13:41.520
So for example, some of the code is about loading a 3D model.

150
0:13:41.520 --> 0:13:46.560
So if you pinch it again, you execute that line of code, you get a 3D model out of it,

151
0:13:46.560 --> 0:13:49.880
and then you can do it a couple of more times.

152
0:13:49.880 --> 0:13:54.880
You get, I see that the contrast is not high there, but you get the history of what you

153
0:13:54.880 --> 0:13:58.560
just executed, then you can save it and execute it again.

154
0:13:58.560 --> 0:14:05.600
So you start to have the same, let's say, primitives you're used to.

155
0:14:05.600 --> 0:14:19.800
And then you can do shortcuts, you can visualize the groupings.

156
0:14:19.800 --> 0:14:27.000
So for the people who twisted their hand instead of raising it, this is also where I'm at in

157
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:32.240
the sense that I don't actually know if it's a fair thing to call this a programming language.

158
0:14:32.240 --> 0:14:35.800
Is it just like a bunch of utils, a bunch of shortcuts?

159
0:14:35.800 --> 0:14:36.800
I'm not sure.

160
0:14:36.800 --> 0:14:41.680
Again, what I find interesting in that process of making a programming language is, yeah,

161
0:14:41.680 --> 0:14:42.680
it's up to you.

162
0:14:42.680 --> 0:14:46.280
It's up to what you find interesting, it's up to what you find efficient.

163
0:14:46.280 --> 0:14:53.480
So yeah, I start, try to document it, stack back a bit, but all what it prompts me to

164
0:14:53.480 --> 0:14:59.320
think of is really, really interesting, really valuable.

165
0:14:59.320 --> 0:15:04.400
And also, if you don't go down that route, there is a subreddit for it.

166
0:15:04.400 --> 0:15:10.320
There's a subreddit for pretty much anything, but yeah, for r slash programming languages,

167
0:15:10.320 --> 0:15:14.040
where you can ask simple questions like this, like what is the most interesting aspect of

168
0:15:14.040 --> 0:15:15.040
it?

169
0:15:15.040 --> 0:15:34.320
So of course, I had to admit that so I display my issues from my repository in my environment

170
0:15:34.320 --> 0:15:37.800
so that I can move them like as if I was on a wall.

171
0:15:37.800 --> 0:15:43.000
I can display 3D models from, let's say, a library of 3D models.

172
0:15:43.000 --> 0:15:47.440
This is where I can organize it, like tiles, and then start to make a 3D environment to

173
0:15:47.440 --> 0:15:49.400
work out in of.

174
0:15:49.400 --> 0:15:52.080
I can do honestly this part, the graphs.

175
0:15:52.080 --> 0:15:55.800
I mostly did because a friend asked me during lunch, I was like, this is annoying.

176
0:15:55.800 --> 0:15:57.720
Everybody find graphs sexy.

177
0:15:57.720 --> 0:16:01.280
It is looking good, but I'm not sure what the point, so just, okay, I'll just make a

178
0:16:01.280 --> 0:16:02.280
graph.

179
0:16:02.280 --> 0:16:08.680
So those are actually the pages of the wiki where I'm taking the notes out of the display

180
0:16:08.680 --> 0:16:12.340
there, and they're all manipulable.

181
0:16:12.340 --> 0:16:16.400
Taking screenshots also in VR, I think that's a great way to document if you're doing a

182
0:16:16.400 --> 0:16:17.400
process.

183
0:16:17.400 --> 0:16:19.320
Of course, you can have the code out of it.

184
0:16:19.320 --> 0:16:21.600
You can save it back to your wiki, for example.

185
0:16:21.600 --> 0:16:27.640
But the movement, how things are going to be organized and how you want to, let's say,

186
0:16:27.640 --> 0:16:30.200
organize the tiles to make the 3D world.

187
0:16:30.200 --> 0:16:35.080
You want to tell a story to someone who might not have, no one to use a headset, then just

188
0:16:35.080 --> 0:16:38.480
taking a screenshot, capturing it, and then sending it elsewhere.

189
0:16:38.480 --> 0:16:49.240
It's a pretty efficient way to do it.

190
0:16:49.240 --> 0:16:50.520
That was just this morning.

191
0:16:50.520 --> 0:16:56.040
So there's the same thing of managing issues, displaying the issues from the repository

192
0:16:56.040 --> 0:16:57.040
line.

193
0:16:57.040 --> 0:16:59.920
I can, again, grab them, move them into places.

194
0:16:59.920 --> 0:17:06.960
But using Swagger, if you're not familiar with Swagger, it's an API to manage all APIs.

195
0:17:06.960 --> 0:17:15.200
So once you have access to when you load using Swagger, yeah, I can load from GitHub, whatever

196
0:17:15.200 --> 0:17:17.480
is going to have a Swagger specification.

197
0:17:17.480 --> 0:17:23.520
And that means making them as, for example, manipulable blocks.

198
0:17:23.520 --> 0:17:28.000
It's federated, so it's social, but if you have your own server, then you can connect

199
0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:30.600
to it, and we can be friends.

200
0:17:30.600 --> 0:17:34.740
We can exchange code also, so I can move the code in my environment, and you can receive

201
0:17:34.740 --> 0:17:37.660
it and execute it.

202
0:17:37.660 --> 0:17:44.080
One port that is kind of funny is snapping, so those are blocks.

203
0:17:44.080 --> 0:17:48.640
You cannot hear it, so you'll have to trust me, but when the blocks are close enough,

204
0:17:48.640 --> 0:17:51.240
you hear them snap.

205
0:17:51.240 --> 0:17:58.120
The points of those blocks of code, or blocks rather, are not just blocks, is you can attach

206
0:17:58.120 --> 0:17:59.320
code on it.

207
0:17:59.320 --> 0:18:02.720
So then you can manipulate them literally like Lego block.

208
0:18:02.720 --> 0:18:07.800
Once again, the part of the interactions that become interesting, yes, you can have a keyboard,

209
0:18:07.800 --> 0:18:12.280
and the keyboard works well, but if you just do the keyboard, yeah, you could just use

210
0:18:12.280 --> 0:18:14.640
a bigger screen if you always not that interesting for it.

211
0:18:14.640 --> 0:18:20.280
If you can have both programming with a keyboard, when naturally manipulating, or simply, let's

212
0:18:20.280 --> 0:18:25.200
say, directly manipulating with your hand, I think that become, again, interesting.

213
0:18:25.200 --> 0:18:28.400
So again, you need to imagine those are not just blocks or blocks of code.

214
0:18:28.400 --> 0:18:32.560
It's called, let's say, for Swagger, so that you can get information from an API or execute

215
0:18:32.560 --> 0:18:40.800
through that API.

216
0:18:40.800 --> 0:18:45.720
So why also do I do all this with blocks?

217
0:18:45.720 --> 0:18:48.600
Because I think that's a great way to learn.

218
0:18:48.600 --> 0:18:54.360
So you can imagine this, the blocks for running code that is abstract, let's say, list things,

219
0:18:54.360 --> 0:18:55.760
but you can use that for chemistry.

220
0:18:55.760 --> 0:19:01.160
Let's say it's a C, and it's a C, or it's an H, H, and an O, and you bring them together,

221
0:19:01.160 --> 0:19:03.400
and they snap when it makes a molecule.

222
0:19:03.400 --> 0:19:07.480
I think the same kind of things apply to pretty much any field of study.

223
0:19:07.480 --> 0:19:14.040
So physics, chemistry, sociology, like you have a set of atoms and a set of rules.

224
0:19:14.040 --> 0:19:20.320
If you get them to have a certain organization specialized together, then you can learn this

225
0:19:20.320 --> 0:19:27.160
field, hopefully, in a more embodied way.

226
0:19:27.160 --> 0:19:46.080
Nope, I guess that's going to be it.

227
0:19:46.080 --> 0:20:00.280
I have a Twitter archive, because it's not working properly, but not for recent things.

228
0:20:00.280 --> 0:20:24.880
Well, okay.

229
0:20:24.880 --> 0:20:28.360
So that's fine.

230
0:20:28.360 --> 0:20:30.080
All this, I think it's pretty interesting.

231
0:20:30.080 --> 0:20:34.240
The one thing I'm even more awkward with, rather than calling the thing I've done my

232
0:20:34.240 --> 0:20:35.960
programming language, is this.

233
0:20:35.960 --> 0:20:39.760
So that headset is an Oculus Quest, or a Meta Quest.

234
0:20:39.760 --> 0:20:41.320
I don't have a Meta account.

235
0:20:41.320 --> 0:20:48.240
I don't think it's, yeah, I don't think civilians' capitalism is a good business model, let's

236
0:20:48.240 --> 0:20:52.240
say, as a society, but it works really well.

237
0:20:52.240 --> 0:20:53.560
So that's pretty awkward.

238
0:20:53.560 --> 0:20:56.840
I really don't think it's such a good thing.

239
0:20:56.840 --> 0:21:03.560
I called it an adversarial dependency, because it helps me to build more, explore more, than

240
0:21:03.560 --> 0:21:07.360
on something I don't want to rely on, because it's not aligned with my set of values.

241
0:21:07.360 --> 0:21:13.880
So I still show all this, because, yeah, you won't see the photo, but there are a couple

242
0:21:13.880 --> 0:21:19.840
of headsets, like the links, that should be there in a couple of weeks.

243
0:21:19.840 --> 0:21:25.560
The point is, don't associate VR with just Meta or Facebook.

244
0:21:25.560 --> 0:21:28.800
It is a convenient one, but there are alternatives coming out.

245
0:21:28.800 --> 0:21:32.800
There is also a similar VR.

246
0:21:32.800 --> 0:21:34.240
It's not the only way to do VR.

247
0:21:34.240 --> 0:21:38.400
So adversarial dependency, in the sense that, yes, you can rely on it temporarily, as long

248
0:21:38.400 --> 0:21:41.360
as you can have it just as a replaceable block.

249
0:21:41.360 --> 0:21:44.720
And as long as you can swap it, whenever you get something that's more aligned with your

250
0:21:44.720 --> 0:21:48.800
value, that is much better.

251
0:21:48.800 --> 0:21:49.800
But that's it, yeah.

252
0:21:49.800 --> 0:21:54.160
The whole point of this is building your own scaffolding, being a programming language,

253
0:21:54.160 --> 0:22:00.560
using a tool chain, using VR, because I find that to be the most interesting interface.

254
0:22:00.560 --> 0:22:02.960
But yeah, that would be my recommendation for you.

255
0:22:02.960 --> 0:22:07.840
Just make your interface, make your scaffolding using VR or not.

256
0:22:07.840 --> 0:22:12.160
And if you want to try the VR one, I'll be around with it.

257
0:22:12.160 --> 0:22:14.160
Thank you.

258
0:22:14.160 --> 0:22:25.320
I think we have time for a couple of questions.

259
0:22:25.320 --> 0:22:28.320
Questions?

260
0:22:28.320 --> 0:22:32.200
Do you have any questions?

261
0:22:32.200 --> 0:22:52.320
I really like the VR experience in the play.

262
0:22:52.320 --> 0:22:58.200
But have you thought about the incidents that may occur, like hitting my neighbors, punching

263
0:22:58.200 --> 0:22:59.200
him?

264
0:22:59.200 --> 0:23:00.200
No?

265
0:23:00.200 --> 0:23:01.200
Thank you.

266
0:23:01.200 --> 0:23:02.200
Thank you.

267
0:23:02.200 --> 0:23:03.200
Yeah.

268
0:23:03.200 --> 0:23:06.360
So I don't recommend punching anybody.

269
0:23:06.360 --> 0:23:08.360
But you're not good.

270
0:23:08.360 --> 0:23:11.000
So you define the interactions however you want.

271
0:23:11.000 --> 0:23:15.880
So basically, if you put things, let's say, to the object, either a block of code or a

272
0:23:15.880 --> 0:23:21.080
hat, whatever, a meter away from you, you're going to punch your neighbor.

273
0:23:21.080 --> 0:23:26.520
But because now you have access to the code in there, you can just say, oh, I bring, let's

274
0:23:26.520 --> 0:23:30.960
say, everything within 50 centimeters radius.

275
0:23:30.960 --> 0:23:32.600
And yeah, you can just do it on the spot.

276
0:23:32.600 --> 0:23:35.480
Again, it's using WebXR.

277
0:23:35.480 --> 0:23:38.800
So it's VR and AR on the web, meaning there is no unity build.

278
0:23:38.800 --> 0:23:40.840
There is nothing there.

279
0:23:40.840 --> 0:23:43.480
Everything is done directly in the headset.

280
0:23:43.480 --> 0:23:48.720
You can put your node, your server, your even your Python server, whatever you want to run.

281
0:23:48.720 --> 0:23:51.800
So it means you can refresh the page.

282
0:23:51.800 --> 0:23:54.000
And then you have your new content and your way to handle it.

283
0:23:54.000 --> 0:23:56.800
So either you do it without even having to reload.

284
0:23:56.800 --> 0:24:01.800
But you can fix it on the fly, let's say.
