00:00.000 --> 00:19.240
Okay, so hi everyone. Good morning. This is so awesome. Welcome to the Kotlin Dev Room

00:19.240 --> 00:29.100
at FOSDIMM 2023. Well, it's been two long years since we saw us in person. I still remember

00:29.100 --> 00:37.640
when we had the first Kotlin Dev Room in 2020. And like not as many people as today. I'm

00:37.640 --> 00:42.800
impressed. I think we had a bigger room and way less people, which was like, I don't know

00:42.800 --> 00:48.620
how many people will actually show up. But yeah, today we are so many. And again, super

00:48.620 --> 00:56.520
excited to get this kicked off. And as we get this kicked off, well, I want to give

00:56.520 --> 01:02.960
like a little bit of stats. First, I'm so proud to share that this year we received so

01:02.960 --> 01:15.600
many proposals for talks. We actually received more proposals than the Go Dev Room, than

01:15.600 --> 01:27.680
the Rust Dev Room, and than the JavaScript Dev Room, which is opening tomorrow in the

01:27.680 --> 01:32.640
same Dev Room. And by the way, if you're so much into Kotlin, make sure you don't miss

01:32.640 --> 01:41.880
tomorrow's JavaScript Dev Room opening talk by Luis. Is Luis in the room today? He's finishing

01:41.880 --> 01:48.120
his slides. But yeah, it will open the JavaScript Dev Room speaking out a ditched JavaScript

01:48.120 --> 01:53.480
for Kotlin. So you definitely don't want to miss that. And so like a couple of other interesting

01:53.480 --> 02:01.240
talks about Kotlin also in the Friends of the OpenJDK Dev Room tomorrow. So check the

02:01.240 --> 02:08.160
agenda. There are a lot of interesting content. So back to the people to thank. Well, first,

02:08.160 --> 02:22.600
I want to give a big shout out to the Dev Room managers. So thank you. It's me, Martin,

02:22.600 --> 02:29.160
Sergey which is there, Olga and Marco. And we do this in our free time. Like we don't

02:29.160 --> 02:34.480
get paid for that. And it's just like it's so awesome to get in touch with the community

02:34.480 --> 02:41.640
and hear your stories, connect with you. And well, thanks for showing up and coming. I

02:41.640 --> 02:49.800
want to say thank you to JabRains for supporting us. So every speaker today will get a t-shirt.

02:49.800 --> 02:58.240
Plus we do have some stickers and stuff to give away. So stay tuned. But yeah, JabRains

02:58.240 --> 03:04.440
is supporting us in organizing this Dev Room. And I want to say thank you to the speakers

03:04.440 --> 03:17.760
which prepared content and just made the Dev Room possible. So thank you very much. And

03:17.760 --> 03:25.600
now back to Martin. So we have a packed agenda for today with more than 15 talks. There is

03:25.600 --> 03:32.600
no sorry, I do not get this good. Yeah, this is agenda. So it's available online. You can

03:32.600 --> 03:38.040
go on the first-day website. You also have an Android app. I'm not sure about an iOS

03:38.040 --> 03:44.560
app. I think some. There is? Okay. So you have apps. Make sure to check it out. We have

03:44.560 --> 03:51.480
a lot of content today. And there is no lunch break at all. So you have to organize yourself

03:51.480 --> 03:57.480
to just decide what you want to do or just bring some sandwiches or you can eat some

03:57.480 --> 04:04.720
waffles too if you want. We have free waffles. That's it. If you want more Kotlin, as Nico

04:04.720 --> 04:10.680
said, there is a talk tomorrow in the JavaScript. You have a lot of Kotlin content today and

04:10.680 --> 04:17.280
tomorrow. If you want to discuss more and have some beers, we meet tonight at the Gist.

04:17.280 --> 04:25.240
This is not here, but you can look it up on Google. And let's meet there. Just once the

04:25.240 --> 04:33.840
Dev Room closes, we can meet or just meet directly there at 8 p.m. Am I doing this one? I think

04:33.840 --> 04:38.000
you're doing this one or am I doing I think I'm doing this one.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.680
I'm pretty fine with that. All right. So like the last years, we will have a live chat on

04:44.680 --> 04:50.920
Slack. If you're not on Slack, give me a shout or we will have links on here. I think, Nico,

04:50.920 --> 05:00.320
you prepared. Deep links. Ping is there. There's the first room. There is the deep link to

05:00.320 --> 05:07.480
Slack room itself. If you're not signed up yet, for whatever reason, use this link. Ask

05:07.480 --> 05:12.360
me if you need it again and you can't take a picture right now. And this is also a good

05:12.360 --> 05:17.520
place to be because as Nico already said, we do have a couple of giveaways. Thanks to

05:17.520 --> 05:24.480
JetBrains, we have I think free licenses to give away. How this works, I will let you

05:24.480 --> 05:33.840
know on the Slack and on Twitter and on Mastodon. So keep an eye on there. Ask me how this works.

05:33.840 --> 05:39.320
Essentially if you ping me there, if you tweet or post, if you tweet or post a picture or

05:39.320 --> 05:46.240
post a picture, I will see you put on the hashtag, Fostum, Kotlin23 or Fostum23, something

05:46.240 --> 05:52.000
like that. I will let you know. And you can win this one at the end of the day. I wanted

05:52.000 --> 05:58.080
to say the year would be quite a long time. I think that's it from my end. If you have

05:58.080 --> 06:04.200
any questions around this, approach me. I will be some there here or close to the coffee.

06:04.200 --> 06:16.800
Okay. Fine. Yeah. Prepared as always. Thank you so much for coming. Yeah.

06:16.800 --> 06:25.280
We will, yes, we will do. Good point. Yeah, here we go. Better? Excellent. All right.

06:25.280 --> 06:34.560
So then enjoy the day. Have fun, network, speak to each other, code, whatever. Enjoy.
