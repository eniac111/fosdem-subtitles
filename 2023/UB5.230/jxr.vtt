WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
So this is more of an entertaining talk, let's say.

00:09.240 --> 00:16.000
It's a lot less technical, probably a lot weirder, I would say.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.240
And hopefully I'll go fast enough so that you can have all the crazy idea questions

00:24.240 --> 00:25.240
at the end.

00:25.240 --> 00:31.240
And even a little demo, I have some hardware with me if you didn't try VR, at least I

00:31.240 --> 00:34.240
think today you should try this if you feel like it.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.760
So that will be, like, say just there where it's fresh.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.240
So I will...

00:41.240 --> 00:47.480
So those are my slides, it's a JSON file, yes, why not.

00:47.480 --> 00:58.040
I will start by saying that I gave a couple of workshops to kids, actually, on discovering

00:58.040 --> 01:00.560
VR.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.880
And that was pretty nice.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.680
I thought initially I would give workshops and give, you know, a rollercoaster.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.840
Some kids asked me about murdering clowns on top of a rollercoaster.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.120
I did not prepare this, I admit.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.680
But that was interesting, different inputs.

01:20.680 --> 01:27.000
I think it's a really interesting way also to consider teaching computer science, programming,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.440
because I was saying there my pine watch, like there is a computer everywhere, that's

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
just a computer.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.760
That's why it might sound weird, it might be a little bit outside of people's comfort

01:36.760 --> 01:42.720
zone but in the end you can program a computer, you can program that.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.800
So I will introduce myself a bit first.

01:46.800 --> 01:56.160
So my name is Fabien, I work mostly at the UPN Parliament as a web consultant, so I just

01:56.160 --> 02:00.040
do VR and AR on the web, that's it.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.080
And I do it as a prototypist.

02:02.080 --> 02:09.680
So meaning all the tips you had or the suggestion you had at the beginning of the day on the

02:09.680 --> 02:13.560
TypeScript, on quality code, I don't know any of that.

02:13.560 --> 02:18.760
As I was saying before, you're chatting with somebody at the entrance, if my code runs

02:18.760 --> 02:21.080
during the duration of the demo, I'm happy.

02:21.080 --> 02:28.400
The next day, yeah, it's a bonus, but that's the length mostly.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.640
And I gave a couple of talks here, at first, on connecting exotic hardware, like the watch

02:34.640 --> 02:39.480
or IoT, everything of course using JavaScript.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.200
And this one will be on how to do this on a plane in a VR headset.

02:44.200 --> 02:51.160
So my motivation behind this is I have a bunch of notes, I have a wiki, that's the wiki,

02:51.160 --> 02:58.040
and I have a, you can still hear me, the 2D visualization of it, but it feels flat, like

02:58.040 --> 03:02.280
I don't want to have my notes in my molysceen or I don't want to have my notes behind the

03:02.280 --> 03:08.280
thin screen, I want them everywhere so I can play with it, like I organize the space.

03:08.280 --> 03:14.440
So for this, I already had a couple of versions, I used Mozilla Hubs, so a little show of hands,

03:14.440 --> 03:16.920
how many of you tried VR at all?

03:16.920 --> 03:20.920
Okay, I would say two-thirds, half two-thirds.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.160
How many of you tried Mozilla Hubs?

03:23.160 --> 03:27.200
Okay, five, six.

03:27.200 --> 03:35.400
So it's a social VR experiment, it's a pretty good solution, to be honest, works quite well,

03:35.400 --> 03:40.520
and you can do this, meaning you can be in a VR headset with your hands moving, you can

03:40.520 --> 03:46.480
be on laptop, on a mobile phone, and you can see this shared virtual space, it's using

03:46.480 --> 03:52.800
3GS for the 3D environment, and you can have PDF, you can have your webcam, you can take

03:52.800 --> 04:00.000
screenshots, you can honestly do pretty much most of what one would want to do.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.160
So I did quite a few hacks, so modification of it, it's obviously open source, that's

04:07.160 --> 04:13.880
the interesting part, but it's not enough, so you can do a bunch of hacks, so I explained

04:13.880 --> 04:18.200
a little bit how, for example, I turned on and off the lights in my office while I'm

04:18.200 --> 04:24.920
in VR, director kits on how to record with traveling, a bunch of different things, to

04:24.920 --> 04:32.640
the point that I did my little toolkit on how to customize, yeah, that's not going to

04:32.640 --> 04:40.760
work here, so you will have the link on the page, so imagine a bunch of functions related

04:40.760 --> 04:47.680
to Hubs to do all this, so I really think basically here the point is Hubs is a good

04:47.680 --> 04:52.840
solution, it works quite well if you want to do just social VR.

04:52.840 --> 04:58.840
The thing is, first of all, it doesn't work offline, and I started after the end of the

04:58.840 --> 05:06.200
pandemic to start to fly again to go see family, and I thought that's one of the best use cases

05:06.200 --> 05:10.120
for VR, like I don't like being on a plane, I don't know if you do, but I think if you're

05:10.120 --> 05:16.120
the pilot it's fine, but otherwise as a passenger it sucks, and one of the beauty of those things

05:16.120 --> 05:21.160
is you put the headset on and you're basically somewhere else, but I don't want to be in

05:21.160 --> 05:27.480
VR on a plane and do a roller coaster or something, I just want to code, I want to be there and

05:27.480 --> 05:32.600
be able to do something that I have agency over, I want to build stuff, I want to create

05:32.600 --> 05:38.600
things, and I don't want to be like this, I want to feel like I'm somewhere else, then

05:38.600 --> 05:47.280
I started to build on that, including, let's say, managing the history in my browser, so

05:47.280 --> 05:51.960
I would take a snapshot of the different pages that I visited, be able to organize them, the

05:51.960 --> 05:58.240
thing is, as you might be able to see, this doesn't look at all like Mozilla Hubs, so

05:58.240 --> 06:03.080
Mozilla Hubs is amazing, but it's a huge stack actually, and it's a stack that depends on

06:03.080 --> 06:08.880
AWS, which I obviously don't have on my plane, or the plane I'm playing with, so then I started

06:08.880 --> 06:13.080
to rebuild it from scratch basically.

06:13.080 --> 06:20.400
One warning also, when you saw it here, programming in VR, I had a discussion with somebody just

06:20.400 --> 06:31.480
yesterday about it, it might be productive, I would say, at some point, but that's not

06:31.480 --> 06:36.200
my point, I don't find that interesting, I have a really nice desk at home, it moves

06:36.200 --> 06:41.960
and all, and I have my ergonomic keyboard, and I can move my 4K screen, I like it, but

06:41.960 --> 06:47.160
I don't have that on the plane, so the point is, being able to move in space when I have

06:47.160 --> 06:52.520
the space, and if I don't, to be able to use the space around me in a really compact manner,

06:52.520 --> 06:56.760
so the point is, this whole argument is like, don't look at this presentation thinking,

06:56.760 --> 06:58.680
is it to replace the way I work today?

06:58.680 --> 07:02.640
That's not the point, it might be if you enter it, but it's more exploring what could be

07:02.640 --> 07:07.200
interesting in terms of interfaces, so yeah, word per minute, if you're trying to sit next

07:07.200 --> 07:12.080
to me with your laptop and we do a competition of how efficient you are, you're going to

07:12.080 --> 07:21.040
win, I mean, I hope for you, but that's not the point.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.440
And I was able actually on the plane to make friends, because the person next to me was

07:26.440 --> 07:33.680
like, what is this guy doing with his keyboard on the tray, plus there was no USB-C on it,

07:33.680 --> 07:40.200
so I need to plug the adapter, put it on top of the device, and then put, it was not wireless

07:40.200 --> 07:45.320
back then, so now I'm pretty happy, I just received this little thing, so it's a Bluetooth

07:45.320 --> 07:52.440
keyboard and it's, you can hear, mechanical one, that's way more efficient back then,

07:52.440 --> 08:00.240
I didn't have this, so yeah, that was a good excuse to meet someone and chat about what

08:00.240 --> 08:03.480
does it actually mean to program in VR.

08:03.480 --> 08:10.560
The next step being actually tinkering with it, so I went from having the history of my

08:10.560 --> 08:20.720
browsing behavior, let's say, to moving content and moving content by just pinching basically

08:20.720 --> 08:26.800
a page, so that's a render of a page, that's not a web page itself.

08:26.800 --> 08:32.040
What hopefully, I don't know if you can see all the way there, but basically with my right

08:32.040 --> 08:37.600
hand I was, I'm able to move things around, and with my left hand I'm able to execute

08:37.600 --> 08:42.240
code, so that's, let's say, the main trick, there was one thing you need to think about

08:42.240 --> 08:48.960
that presentation, it's about moving things around freely or naturally, but also you will

08:48.960 --> 08:56.160
see the, so I move things, the red sphere there, and then if I pinch on that piece of

08:56.160 --> 09:01.640
code, the sphere there is blue, so it's not just moving things around, but it starts too

09:01.640 --> 09:06.440
many text, which takes this code, and then code can change the environment you're inside

09:06.440 --> 09:10.680
of.

09:10.680 --> 09:24.480
And the one trick to do this, I will hide it away, but you can guess, how do I execute

09:24.480 --> 09:26.600
code in JavaScript?

09:26.600 --> 09:32.440
The one thing you're not supposed to use, evil, because it's evil, I think that's the

09:32.440 --> 09:36.480
one use case when you can use it, when your string of text is actually code, and you're

09:36.480 --> 09:42.360
not running a bank or something like this, like this is my code running on my headset,

09:42.360 --> 09:48.160
I don't have anything that I won't accept to break, let's say, but even then it's executing

09:48.160 --> 09:54.240
locally, so that's the one reason, in my opinion, to use it.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.640
So the idea behind it is, oh, I can manipulate text, that text can be code, I can change

10:00.640 --> 10:07.400
that text directly while I'm in the headset, either pinching it like single letters, or

10:07.400 --> 10:11.720
with a keyboard to be more efficient, and then I can execute it, which is going to change

10:11.720 --> 10:18.360
the whole environment I'm inside of.

10:18.360 --> 10:26.760
So the trick for it was basically what I like to think of, the escape valve, which is to

10:26.760 --> 10:31.920
say that, yeah, I could redesign an entire programming language, I could make it a programming

10:31.920 --> 10:38.760
language for VR, but I can also rely on one I already know, and that already has an engine

10:38.760 --> 10:44.600
in it, so namely JavaScript, so that's a little, let's say, trick, so I'll show a couple of

10:44.600 --> 10:50.480
examples, but that was an excuse not just to manipulate text and this code, but then

10:50.480 --> 10:55.760
to start to make my own programming language, so how many of us here have made their own

10:55.760 --> 10:56.760
programming language?

10:56.760 --> 11:03.040
Yeah, I see, I see, there are very few hands that are like this, most hands are like that,

11:03.040 --> 11:08.360
I'm like that too, I don't think, honestly, I feel a little bit, maybe not ashamed, but

11:08.360 --> 11:14.760
I'm not proud of it either, what I'm trying to convey is the endeavor, trying to do it

11:14.760 --> 11:19.480
is super interesting, I don't think I've learned as much recently as trying to do this.

11:19.480 --> 11:24.880
I also recommend, if you check the slides or the presentation after, don't learn my

11:24.880 --> 11:28.760
programming language, I don't think it's a good one, it's a very interesting one for

11:28.760 --> 11:33.240
me by building it, by seeing the limitations of my understanding of what a programming

11:33.240 --> 11:39.440
language is, but so this, why do I recommend this course specifically?

11:39.440 --> 11:44.560
It's because he's not going to, let's say, let's do an alternative to C, which for most

11:44.560 --> 11:49.680
of us would be too far and not practical, he's basically saying, well, JavaScript is

11:49.680 --> 11:55.320
a language, the browser will notice an environment you can already work with, you can transpile,

11:55.320 --> 12:00.240
you can use Babel, and that's enough, let's say, to get the foundation of what a programming

12:00.240 --> 12:01.840
language is.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.400
So I really recommend this kind of course if you're considering making your own programming

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
language.

12:06.400 --> 12:20.240
And also, I don't know how many of you are familiar with this book?

12:20.240 --> 12:28.080
I don't think I can go back easy either.

12:28.080 --> 12:33.560
So yeah, if you ever try to learn, I think, the foundation of programming and programming

12:33.560 --> 12:39.080
languages, usually you often do it with Lisp, which works well because it's so compact that

12:39.080 --> 12:44.280
you can keep it all in your mind, basically.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.800
But again, most of us are not familiar with Lisp, and even if we are, then it's not what

12:48.800 --> 12:50.400
we work with on a daily basis.

12:50.400 --> 12:56.080
So, SAP, but the JavaScript version has been out for a couple of years now, so if you want

12:56.080 --> 13:02.240
to learn the foundation of a programming language while being familiar with the language itself,

13:02.240 --> 13:03.680
I really recommend it.

13:03.680 --> 13:16.000
It's quite taking, but I think it's a good investment.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.040
So then I'll show a couple of the features of the environment, but I won't show all of

13:21.040 --> 13:23.320
them, go too deep in there.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.360
But then what's interesting is you don't have just one line of code, but then you start

13:27.360 --> 13:32.880
to have groups of lines of code or history, the stack of which you executed.

13:32.880 --> 13:37.120
Of course, because you're in VR, code is not everything.

13:37.120 --> 13:41.520
So for example, some of the code is about loading a 3D model.

13:41.520 --> 13:46.560
So if you pinch it again, you execute that line of code, you get a 3D model out of it,

13:46.560 --> 13:49.880
and then you can do it a couple of more times.

13:49.880 --> 13:54.880
You get, I see that the contrast is not high there, but you get the history of what you

13:54.880 --> 13:58.560
just executed, then you can save it and execute it again.

13:58.560 --> 14:05.600
So you start to have the same, let's say, primitives you're used to.

14:05.600 --> 14:19.800
And then you can do shortcuts, you can visualize the groupings.

14:19.800 --> 14:27.000
So for the people who twisted their hand instead of raising it, this is also where I'm at in

14:27.000 --> 14:32.240
the sense that I don't actually know if it's a fair thing to call this a programming language.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.800
Is it just like a bunch of utils, a bunch of shortcuts?

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
I'm not sure.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.680
Again, what I find interesting in that process of making a programming language is, yeah,

14:41.680 --> 14:42.680
it's up to you.

14:42.680 --> 14:46.280
It's up to what you find interesting, it's up to what you find efficient.

14:46.280 --> 14:53.480
So yeah, I start, try to document it, stack back a bit, but all what it prompts me to

14:53.480 --> 14:59.320
think of is really, really interesting, really valuable.

14:59.320 --> 15:04.400
And also, if you don't go down that route, there is a subreddit for it.

15:04.400 --> 15:10.320
There's a subreddit for pretty much anything, but yeah, for r slash programming languages,

15:10.320 --> 15:14.040
where you can ask simple questions like this, like what is the most interesting aspect of

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
it?

15:15.040 --> 15:34.320
So of course, I had to admit that so I display my issues from my repository in my environment

15:34.320 --> 15:37.800
so that I can move them like as if I was on a wall.

15:37.800 --> 15:43.000
I can display 3D models from, let's say, a library of 3D models.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.440
This is where I can organize it, like tiles, and then start to make a 3D environment to

15:47.440 --> 15:49.400
work out in of.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.080
I can do honestly this part, the graphs.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.800
I mostly did because a friend asked me during lunch, I was like, this is annoying.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.720
Everybody find graphs sexy.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.280
It is looking good, but I'm not sure what the point, so just, okay, I'll just make a

16:01.280 --> 16:02.280
graph.

16:02.280 --> 16:08.680
So those are actually the pages of the wiki where I'm taking the notes out of the display

16:08.680 --> 16:12.340
there, and they're all manipulable.

16:12.340 --> 16:16.400
Taking screenshots also in VR, I think that's a great way to document if you're doing a

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
process.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.320
Of course, you can have the code out of it.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.600
You can save it back to your wiki, for example.

16:21.600 --> 16:27.640
But the movement, how things are going to be organized and how you want to, let's say,

16:27.640 --> 16:30.200
organize the tiles to make the 3D world.

16:30.200 --> 16:35.080
You want to tell a story to someone who might not have, no one to use a headset, then just

16:35.080 --> 16:38.480
taking a screenshot, capturing it, and then sending it elsewhere.

16:38.480 --> 16:49.240
It's a pretty efficient way to do it.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.520
That was just this morning.

16:50.520 --> 16:56.040
So there's the same thing of managing issues, displaying the issues from the repository

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
line.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.920
I can, again, grab them, move them into places.

16:59.920 --> 17:06.960
But using Swagger, if you're not familiar with Swagger, it's an API to manage all APIs.

17:06.960 --> 17:15.200
So once you have access to when you load using Swagger, yeah, I can load from GitHub, whatever

17:15.200 --> 17:17.480
is going to have a Swagger specification.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.520
And that means making them as, for example, manipulable blocks.

17:23.520 --> 17:28.000
It's federated, so it's social, but if you have your own server, then you can connect

17:28.000 --> 17:30.600
to it, and we can be friends.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.740
We can exchange code also, so I can move the code in my environment, and you can receive

17:34.740 --> 17:37.660
it and execute it.

17:37.660 --> 17:44.080
One port that is kind of funny is snapping, so those are blocks.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.640
You cannot hear it, so you'll have to trust me, but when the blocks are close enough,

17:48.640 --> 17:51.240
you hear them snap.

17:51.240 --> 17:58.120
The points of those blocks of code, or blocks rather, are not just blocks, is you can attach

17:58.120 --> 17:59.320
code on it.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.720
So then you can manipulate them literally like Lego block.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.800
Once again, the part of the interactions that become interesting, yes, you can have a keyboard,

18:07.800 --> 18:12.280
and the keyboard works well, but if you just do the keyboard, yeah, you could just use

18:12.280 --> 18:14.640
a bigger screen if you always not that interesting for it.

18:14.640 --> 18:20.280
If you can have both programming with a keyboard, when naturally manipulating, or simply, let's

18:20.280 --> 18:25.200
say, directly manipulating with your hand, I think that become, again, interesting.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.400
So again, you need to imagine those are not just blocks or blocks of code.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.560
It's called, let's say, for Swagger, so that you can get information from an API or execute

18:32.560 --> 18:40.800
through that API.

18:40.800 --> 18:45.720
So why also do I do all this with blocks?

18:45.720 --> 18:48.600
Because I think that's a great way to learn.

18:48.600 --> 18:54.360
So you can imagine this, the blocks for running code that is abstract, let's say, list things,

18:54.360 --> 18:55.760
but you can use that for chemistry.

18:55.760 --> 19:01.160
Let's say it's a C, and it's a C, or it's an H, H, and an O, and you bring them together,

19:01.160 --> 19:03.400
and they snap when it makes a molecule.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.480
I think the same kind of things apply to pretty much any field of study.

19:07.480 --> 19:14.040
So physics, chemistry, sociology, like you have a set of atoms and a set of rules.

19:14.040 --> 19:20.320
If you get them to have a certain organization specialized together, then you can learn this

19:20.320 --> 19:27.160
field, hopefully, in a more embodied way.

19:27.160 --> 19:46.080
Nope, I guess that's going to be it.

19:46.080 --> 20:00.280
I have a Twitter archive, because it's not working properly, but not for recent things.

20:00.280 --> 20:24.880
Well, okay.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.360
So that's fine.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.080
All this, I think it's pretty interesting.

20:30.080 --> 20:34.240
The one thing I'm even more awkward with, rather than calling the thing I've done my

20:34.240 --> 20:35.960
programming language, is this.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.760
So that headset is an Oculus Quest, or a Meta Quest.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.320
I don't have a Meta account.

20:41.320 --> 20:48.240
I don't think it's, yeah, I don't think civilians' capitalism is a good business model, let's

20:48.240 --> 20:52.240
say, as a society, but it works really well.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.560
So that's pretty awkward.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.840
I really don't think it's such a good thing.

20:56.840 --> 21:03.560
I called it an adversarial dependency, because it helps me to build more, explore more, than

21:03.560 --> 21:07.360
on something I don't want to rely on, because it's not aligned with my set of values.

21:07.360 --> 21:13.880
So I still show all this, because, yeah, you won't see the photo, but there are a couple

21:13.880 --> 21:19.840
of headsets, like the links, that should be there in a couple of weeks.

21:19.840 --> 21:25.560
The point is, don't associate VR with just Meta or Facebook.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.800
It is a convenient one, but there are alternatives coming out.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.800
There is also a similar VR.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.240
It's not the only way to do VR.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.400
So adversarial dependency, in the sense that, yes, you can rely on it temporarily, as long

21:38.400 --> 21:41.360
as you can have it just as a replaceable block.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.720
And as long as you can swap it, whenever you get something that's more aligned with your

21:44.720 --> 21:48.800
value, that is much better.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
But that's it, yeah.

21:49.800 --> 21:54.160
The whole point of this is building your own scaffolding, being a programming language,

21:54.160 --> 22:00.560
using a tool chain, using VR, because I find that to be the most interesting interface.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.960
But yeah, that would be my recommendation for you.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.840
Just make your interface, make your scaffolding using VR or not.

22:07.840 --> 22:12.160
And if you want to try the VR one, I'll be around with it.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.160
Thank you.

22:14.160 --> 22:25.320
I think we have time for a couple of questions.

22:25.320 --> 22:28.320
Questions?

22:28.320 --> 22:32.200
Do you have any questions?

22:32.200 --> 22:52.320
I really like the VR experience in the play.

22:52.320 --> 22:58.200
But have you thought about the incidents that may occur, like hitting my neighbors, punching

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
him?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
No?

23:00.200 --> 23:01.200
Thank you.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.200
Thank you.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.200
Yeah.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.360
So I don't recommend punching anybody.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.360
But you're not good.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.000
So you define the interactions however you want.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.880
So basically, if you put things, let's say, to the object, either a block of code or a

23:15.880 --> 23:21.080
hat, whatever, a meter away from you, you're going to punch your neighbor.

23:21.080 --> 23:26.520
But because now you have access to the code in there, you can just say, oh, I bring, let's

23:26.520 --> 23:30.960
say, everything within 50 centimeters radius.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.600
And yeah, you can just do it on the spot.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.480
Again, it's using WebXR.

23:35.480 --> 23:38.800
So it's VR and AR on the web, meaning there is no unity build.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.840
There is nothing there.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.480
Everything is done directly in the headset.

23:43.480 --> 23:48.720
You can put your node, your server, your even your Python server, whatever you want to run.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.800
So it means you can refresh the page.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.000
And then you have your new content and your way to handle it.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.800
So either you do it without even having to reload.

23:56.800 --> 24:01.800
But you can fix it on the fly, let's say.
