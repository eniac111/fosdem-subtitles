1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.040
Hello.

2
0:00:09.040 --> 0:00:13.860
So one quick question for the next speakers.

3
0:00:13.860 --> 0:00:18.100
Can you please identify yourself towards us then?

4
0:00:18.100 --> 0:00:20.700
So Karen, who's the next one?

5
0:00:20.700 --> 0:00:21.700
Sarah Chain.

6
0:00:21.700 --> 0:00:22.700
Sarah Chain.

7
0:00:22.700 --> 0:00:25.720
So if you're around, then please come to Karen.

8
0:00:25.720 --> 0:00:32.600
So our next speaker here is Luca Bonisi and he will talk about one topic when I first

9
0:00:32.600 --> 0:00:36.640
saw what he was accomplishing there as one person.

10
0:00:36.640 --> 0:00:37.640
It was amazing.

11
0:00:37.640 --> 0:00:43.380
So and the rest he will talk about it, but yeah, it's amazing what one person was able

12
0:00:43.380 --> 0:00:45.680
to do there.

13
0:00:45.680 --> 0:00:48.480
Hello.

14
0:00:48.480 --> 0:00:53.440
Welcome to Fosman and welcome to the Sorskum.

15
0:00:53.440 --> 0:01:05.280
This talk is about the right to install any software on your device, on your own device.

16
0:01:05.280 --> 0:01:18.920
And concept is what, in my opinion, is an unlawful behavior to install, to pre-install

17
0:01:18.920 --> 0:01:30.440
software on a PC that you normally bought in your device.

18
0:01:30.440 --> 0:01:37.200
Specifically, this software are a window, a proprietary software that are Windows and

19
0:01:37.200 --> 0:01:38.200
Office.

20
0:01:38.200 --> 0:01:42.200
I briefly introduced myself.

21
0:01:42.200 --> 0:02:02.400
The images, sorry, because the images are missing.

22
0:02:02.400 --> 0:02:20.600
Okay, we need to get the screen.

23
0:02:20.600 --> 0:02:21.600
Sorry.

24
0:02:21.600 --> 0:02:36.280
There we are, display.

25
0:02:36.280 --> 0:02:52.720
How to make a single display.

26
0:02:52.720 --> 0:03:06.960
Okay, I know this one, okay.

27
0:03:06.960 --> 0:03:09.920
Very good.

28
0:03:09.920 --> 0:03:13.320
Okay, I introduce a different introduce myself.

29
0:03:13.320 --> 0:03:15.440
My name is Luca Bonisi.

30
0:03:15.440 --> 0:03:18.200
I come from Italy.

31
0:03:18.200 --> 0:03:23.320
My main job is developing a firmware of electronic devices.

32
0:03:23.320 --> 0:03:33.680
And I also support some school and small office with free software, especially one school

33
0:03:33.680 --> 0:03:43.040
that I defined a free software school where all teachers and students are using free software.

34
0:03:43.040 --> 0:03:49.720
I have some of you that are always related to free software.

35
0:03:49.720 --> 0:04:04.160
I am audio and video technicians where I use Abul, Jack, Jamil, Sinodena, and I play guitar

36
0:04:04.160 --> 0:04:14.760
and piano, and I use Rose Garden as a MIDI player to record from piano.

37
0:04:14.760 --> 0:04:19.600
I like to observe celestial objects like the ISS.

38
0:04:19.600 --> 0:04:28.720
This image is the ISS photographed by me with a normal camera.

39
0:04:28.720 --> 0:04:43.160
I built an Etradiprinter and using them mainly for pairing or also for fun.

40
0:04:43.160 --> 0:04:50.040
I make some free software project or activity.

41
0:04:50.040 --> 0:04:59.880
One is to make a chart on the effects of songs since I play piano and guitar and transpose

42
0:04:59.880 --> 0:05:00.880
it automatically.

43
0:05:00.880 --> 0:05:12.920
Another is I'm the maintainer of an official part of Zlacuo Linux distribution for many

44
0:05:12.920 --> 0:05:15.920
platform and spews.

45
0:05:15.920 --> 0:05:24.000
A project that I just started is to free your Android TV box.

46
0:05:24.000 --> 0:05:34.680
I bought a cheap Android TV box and I installed Linux to be used as a general purpose devices.

47
0:05:34.680 --> 0:05:41.520
And I am a volunteer of the FSC as a translator.

48
0:05:41.520 --> 0:05:52.840
For FSC, I build this project that was built in Peru, a language that maybe not so used,

49
0:05:52.840 --> 0:05:56.480
but I love it.

50
0:05:56.480 --> 0:06:06.440
And I built this program to help translate on FSC, to help translation in the FSC, the

51
0:06:06.440 --> 0:06:14.800
translation process, so the translation has not to care about the HTML formatting and

52
0:06:14.800 --> 0:06:17.680
so on.

53
0:06:17.680 --> 0:06:25.640
I contribute also at this fantastic book.

54
0:06:25.640 --> 0:06:33.440
I maintain the repository of this free software book.

55
0:06:33.440 --> 0:06:41.880
Free software means that this book is distributed with a free license.

56
0:06:41.880 --> 0:06:46.880
And it was translated in five languages actually.

57
0:06:46.880 --> 0:06:53.120
German, Ukrainian, Italian, Arabic and English.

58
0:06:53.120 --> 0:07:02.840
The Italian book is not yet published, but we wish it would soon publish it.

59
0:07:02.840 --> 0:07:10.440
And if you like this book, you can attend the reading of the book, this evening at 6

60
0:07:10.440 --> 0:07:11.440
p.m.

61
0:07:11.440 --> 0:07:16.600
And Matthias will be the reader, I think.

62
0:07:16.600 --> 0:07:17.600
Okay.

63
0:07:17.600 --> 0:07:23.240
Once I'll be, I make ice creams.

64
0:07:23.240 --> 0:07:34.080
Since the book talks also about ice cream, it is very related to my hobby.

65
0:07:34.080 --> 0:07:41.320
And if you are a producer, you go to Ubi 2 this evening.

66
0:07:41.320 --> 0:07:47.560
In this presentation, we found many illustrations, like the one on the right, that comes from

67
0:07:47.560 --> 0:07:48.560
the book.

68
0:07:48.560 --> 0:07:51.800
So I sponsored a little bit the book.

69
0:07:51.800 --> 0:07:53.360
Okay.

70
0:07:53.360 --> 0:07:57.800
We start with the presentation.

71
0:07:57.800 --> 0:08:10.840
We have two different contracts.

72
0:08:10.840 --> 0:08:14.560
One is for the hardware and one is for the software.

73
0:08:14.560 --> 0:08:18.720
This contract cannot be joined together.

74
0:08:18.720 --> 0:08:34.640
You cannot force to join the contract and to force to give back also the hardware if

75
0:08:34.640 --> 0:08:37.360
you ask for the refund.

76
0:08:37.360 --> 0:08:48.040
Because the hardware contract is a sales and purchase agreement.

77
0:08:48.040 --> 0:08:53.720
And you become the ownership of the product, of your PC, of the product.

78
0:08:53.720 --> 0:09:02.880
And nobody can force you to do what you don't want to do.

79
0:09:02.880 --> 0:09:06.320
Instead the software is a license agreement.

80
0:09:06.320 --> 0:09:17.120
You have a right to use the software under some condition that for proprietary software,

81
0:09:17.120 --> 0:09:20.120
like Windows and Office, are limitations.

82
0:09:20.120 --> 0:09:29.040
Instead for free software are freedoms.

83
0:09:29.040 --> 0:09:33.400
I talk about device neutrality.

84
0:09:33.400 --> 0:09:47.760
Because you have the right to choose to install what software you like.

85
0:09:47.760 --> 0:09:59.040
Also by installing free software on your device, you gain the sovereignty of your device.

86
0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:05.440
Preparatory software, you don't know what proprietary software make on your device.

87
0:10:05.440 --> 0:10:15.760
What proprietary software connect to some site that you don't know.

88
0:10:15.760 --> 0:10:23.720
Using running free software can overcome software obsolescence.

89
0:10:23.720 --> 0:10:31.040
Because especially with the newer version of proprietary software, you are forced to

90
0:10:31.040 --> 0:10:37.920
change your hardware because newer version of proprietary software doesn't run on older

91
0:10:37.920 --> 0:10:38.920
hardware.

92
0:10:38.920 --> 0:10:48.360
Instead of free software, you can customize like I do with the two boxes and run also

93
0:10:48.360 --> 0:10:51.160
on lower end devices.

94
0:10:51.160 --> 0:11:00.920
And in this way you extend the hardware lifetime and also you reduce the electronic impact

95
0:11:00.920 --> 0:11:04.800
of the loss.

96
0:11:04.800 --> 0:11:15.680
There is also an open letter that the Free Software Foundation Europe asked you to sign

97
0:11:15.680 --> 0:11:22.480
up to federalize to install any software on your device.

98
0:11:22.480 --> 0:11:23.960
The link is this one.

99
0:11:23.960 --> 0:11:28.040
Maybe it will be available later.

100
0:11:28.040 --> 0:11:36.720
And Free Software Foundation Europe asked to the European Parliament and Commission and

101
0:11:36.720 --> 0:11:53.240
also to the Public Administration to be able that every device should be independent from

102
0:11:53.240 --> 0:12:03.360
the software it runs because using open standards and open interfaces.

103
0:12:03.360 --> 0:12:13.000
This is related to our work because sometimes other manufacturers use this proprietary interface

104
0:12:13.000 --> 0:12:26.960
that limit the possibility to use some feature of your device.

105
0:12:26.960 --> 0:12:33.240
We can first of all technical others.

106
0:12:33.240 --> 0:12:43.600
First say this is real what Microsoft says from a device I put here for the laptop surface

107
0:12:43.600 --> 0:12:44.600
I put here.

108
0:12:44.600 --> 0:12:52.160
Microsoft says that the device would not work properly with other operating system and they

109
0:12:52.160 --> 0:12:53.640
are not supported.

110
0:12:53.640 --> 0:13:06.400
This is said by Microsoft and this is true because my laptop surface that the touch screen

111
0:13:06.400 --> 0:13:08.560
doesn't work.

112
0:13:08.560 --> 0:13:16.160
The webcam doesn't work with new links due to proprietary interface of this device.

113
0:13:16.160 --> 0:13:17.680
So installing the

114
0:13:17.680 --> 0:13:27.080
reference to the links is not straightforward because the keyboard and the touchpad doesn't

115
0:13:27.080 --> 0:13:31.760
work if you don't build the customizes kernel.

116
0:13:31.760 --> 0:13:43.000
So the drivers for keyboard and touchpad are not in the main line but okay you can compile

117
0:13:43.000 --> 0:13:50.960
and then it works.

118
0:13:50.960 --> 0:13:59.360
The manufacturer could also lock the bootloader for example Microsoft with the armed devices

119
0:13:59.360 --> 0:14:06.720
and Windows 8 lock the secure boot in a way that you cannot install software different

120
0:14:06.720 --> 0:14:08.760
than Microsoft Windows.

121
0:14:08.760 --> 0:14:18.720
So the device is not really your because you can only run software certified by another

122
0:14:18.720 --> 0:14:23.280
party.

123
0:14:23.280 --> 0:14:27.880
We come to legal hardware.

124
0:14:27.880 --> 0:14:36.760
Manufacturers often say that you even if the license say that you must contact the manufacturers.

125
0:14:36.760 --> 0:14:46.760
Manufacturers say that you have to ask the reference to the render or to Microsoft but this is

126
0:14:46.760 --> 0:14:52.640
not true because the license agreement say that you have to contact the manufacturer.

127
0:14:52.640 --> 0:15:00.800
Manufacturers say that you must also run the PC.

128
0:15:00.800 --> 0:15:11.540
So you should have all the

129
0:15:11.540 --> 0:15:16.720
you can't have only the software refund.

130
0:15:16.720 --> 0:15:26.680
Manufacturers set a very little time span to ask for the refund usually only 30 days.

131
0:15:26.680 --> 0:15:35.160
Infant says that you must prove you refuse the license but it is impossible to prove

132
0:15:35.160 --> 0:15:42.600
you refuse the license because when you start from the first time Windows you have only

133
0:15:42.600 --> 0:15:44.960
one button asset.

134
0:15:44.960 --> 0:15:48.200
You cannot even power down the PC.

135
0:15:48.200 --> 0:15:55.440
Especially if it is a laptop it could be a problem because the battery is integrated

136
0:15:55.440 --> 0:16:02.600
as usual and you cannot power off the PC if you don't know that you have to press the

137
0:16:02.600 --> 0:16:05.600
power button for that.

138
0:16:05.600 --> 0:16:18.680
Gradually a manufacturer is reaching their policy and say that you must return the PC

139
0:16:18.680 --> 0:16:25.920
to their laboratory because you must remove the product that is information about the

140
0:16:25.920 --> 0:16:32.760
Windows license in the store in the BIOS.

141
0:16:32.760 --> 0:16:42.000
And manufacturers set a price by your own not the market price of the Windows license.

142
0:16:42.000 --> 0:16:56.240
When you first run the PC to see the license agreement because to refuse the license agreement

143
0:16:56.240 --> 0:16:59.120
you have to see the license agreement.

144
0:16:59.120 --> 0:17:08.640
With the latest Windows version it is mandatory to connect your PC to internet before viewing

145
0:17:08.640 --> 0:17:11.120
the license agreement.

146
0:17:11.120 --> 0:17:23.280
I think this could be not compliant to the GDPR because your PC sends information to

147
0:17:23.280 --> 0:17:30.320
manufacturer and to Microsoft sites without your explicit agreement.

148
0:17:30.320 --> 0:17:38.520
There is no refuse button as already said and you cannot install a different license

149
0:17:38.520 --> 0:17:50.400
if you remove the Windows and you download the Microsoft Windows from Microsoft website

150
0:17:50.400 --> 0:17:56.440
and you want to install a few license or also the Gradus license because Windows is Gradus.

151
0:17:56.440 --> 0:18:01.480
This is only limitation that you cannot customize the toolbar.

152
0:18:01.480 --> 0:18:07.720
You cannot do it because when you install the version you downloaded from the internet

153
0:18:07.720 --> 0:18:10.040
it looks for the product key.

154
0:18:10.040 --> 0:18:15.720
So you have in your search circuits.

155
0:18:15.720 --> 0:18:11.120
Very briefly cases of the

156
0:18:11.120 --> 0:18:21.120
Refund in Italy.

157
0:18:21.120 --> 0:18:30.720
There was a case in 2005 against HPE.

158
0:18:30.720 --> 0:18:42.720
The case came to the Supreme Court of Italy and that say the Refund must be give.

159
0:18:42.720 --> 0:18:52.840
It worked about nine years it lasts to all the SQL.

160
0:18:52.840 --> 0:18:55.840
The second case is similar.

161
0:18:55.840 --> 0:19:00.840
It takes also nine years.

162
0:19:00.840 --> 0:19:04.840
It's very similar.

163
0:19:04.840 --> 0:19:18.840
And this case is regarding this PC.

164
0:19:18.840 --> 0:19:26.840
And I repressed the Refund in 2018.

165
0:19:26.840 --> 0:19:31.840
Lenovo refused categorically the Refund of the only software.

166
0:19:31.840 --> 0:19:38.840
They asked that they say that I have to let a known of the PC.

167
0:19:38.840 --> 0:19:47.840
But I filed a court case by myself without an order in Italy

168
0:19:47.840 --> 0:19:54.840
because from my side it was clear that Lenovo has wrong.

169
0:19:54.840 --> 0:20:08.840
But Lenovo introduced artificial complexity so that I cannot continue without an order.

170
0:20:08.840 --> 0:20:10.840
So I asked for an order.

171
0:20:10.840 --> 0:20:13.840
I win the first grade lawsuit.

172
0:20:13.840 --> 0:20:19.840
But Lenovo immediately filed the second grade appeal, the second grade lawsuit.

173
0:20:19.840 --> 0:20:31.840
And they lost the second grade but the judge of Montserrat-Couft

174
0:20:31.840 --> 0:20:46.840
imposed to Lenovo primitive damages of 20,000 euros because they use the legal instruments

175
0:20:46.840 --> 0:20:53.840
with bad faith, without any valid reason.

176
0:20:53.840 --> 0:21:04.840
After these cases, we requested also other rules of the Refund.

177
0:21:04.840 --> 0:21:13.840
The case was simpler but not so easy.

178
0:21:13.840 --> 0:21:18.840
Azure, for example, asked to write on the PC to remove the product K.

179
0:21:18.840 --> 0:21:26.840
In this case, since I had some front end, excessive front end,

180
0:21:26.840 --> 0:21:33.840
I go with the bike to bring the my PC to Azure.

181
0:21:33.840 --> 0:21:41.840
There are also other cases, one with Microsoft, as I already said.

182
0:21:41.840 --> 0:21:48.840
One with HP, I filed a court case against HP.

183
0:21:48.840 --> 0:21:53.840
They lost the court case.

184
0:21:53.840 --> 0:22:03.840
But in this case, the judge does not recognize to me the legal fee.

185
0:22:03.840 --> 0:22:07.840
So the balance was the same.

186
0:22:07.840 --> 0:22:12.840
I lost what I gained from the Refund.

187
0:22:12.840 --> 0:22:18.840
Other cases, I go...

188
0:22:18.840 --> 0:22:24.840
This is interesting, the last year with Azure,

189
0:22:24.840 --> 0:22:30.840
because when I asked to answer, this time I need the PC immediately,

190
0:22:30.840 --> 0:22:37.840
so I cannot wait to send the PC to Azure and to give it back.

191
0:22:37.840 --> 0:22:47.840
And that's to say that it was Microsoft that asked to send the PC

192
0:22:47.840 --> 0:22:51.840
to the manufacturer to remove the product K.

193
0:22:51.840 --> 0:23:02.840
Then I filed a court case, but it was stopped by the officer before

194
0:23:02.840 --> 0:23:11.840
I had reached the first hearing, so they gave me 129 labels.

195
0:23:11.840 --> 0:23:19.840
The latest case against Lenovo that was terminated three days ago.

196
0:23:19.840 --> 0:23:27.840
Lenovo says again that you must write on the PC to the manufacturer

197
0:23:27.840 --> 0:23:33.840
and they say that they are not satisfied by the license.

198
0:23:33.840 --> 0:23:37.840
The license they propose, they are not satisfied by the license,

199
0:23:37.840 --> 0:23:44.840
they themselves propose, so it is not very coherent.

200
0:23:44.840 --> 0:23:50.840
Okay, asking for the phone, I go very quickly.

201
0:23:50.840 --> 0:23:54.840
You have to power on the PC, you have to read the license,

202
0:23:54.840 --> 0:24:04.840
contact the manufacturer, send the mail, and a certified email in Italy.

203
0:24:04.840 --> 0:24:11.840
And you have to be very patient because many, many mails

204
0:24:11.840 --> 0:24:18.840
you have to send before requesting the refund, before having the refund,

205
0:24:18.840 --> 0:24:21.840
but you will have the refund.

206
0:24:21.840 --> 0:24:30.840
Okay, one important thing is that the manufacturer artificially

207
0:24:30.840 --> 0:24:37.840
increases the cost of the PC with a mandatory payment to Microsoft.

208
0:24:37.840 --> 0:24:47.840
I think that if you obtain the refund, you have to give part of the refund

209
0:24:47.840 --> 0:24:51.840
to some free software organization.

210
0:24:51.840 --> 0:24:57.840
I give all 20,000 euros to this association.

211
0:24:57.840 --> 0:25:07.840
And if you want to donate, you can go to the link down

212
0:25:07.840 --> 0:25:14.840
and if you can support the Office of the Foundation for their valuable work.

213
0:25:14.840 --> 0:25:16.840
Thank you.

214
0:25:16.840 --> 0:25:18.840
Thank you.

215
0:25:46.840 --> 0:25:49.840
Thank you.
