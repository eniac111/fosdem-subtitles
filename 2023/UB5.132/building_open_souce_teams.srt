0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:17.500
Hello, everybody. My name is Bruce Mamjin. I am from Philadelphia. I am one of the Post

2
0:00:17.500 --> 0:00:22.380
Course Core Team members, and I'm going to talk for the next 30 minutes about some of

3
0:00:22.380 --> 0:00:28.940
the nuts and bolts of building open source teams. I know the previous talk was more of

4
0:00:28.940 --> 0:00:35.760
a little more high level. This is definitely trench level activity here because that's

5
0:00:35.760 --> 0:00:42.760
what I've done for a long time. I'm basically a co-founder of the Post Course Internet Development

6
0:00:42.760 --> 0:00:48.360
Group. We have a dev room downstairs. We had a big conference on Friday at a local hotel.

7
0:00:48.360 --> 0:00:56.720
We have a whole bunch of events coming up, Paris, Stockholm, Malta. We got one in Chicago.

8
0:00:56.720 --> 0:01:04.480
We're going to be at scale in a couple weeks. We have Ottawa and hopefully one in Singapore

9
0:01:04.480 --> 0:01:10.640
coming up. A whole bunch of stuff going on. I travel a lot. I've been a Core Team member

10
0:01:10.640 --> 0:01:16.120
since the community started in 1996, and I've worked for three open source companies. I've

11
0:01:16.120 --> 0:01:21.400
been around the block, and I have some insights into how we've built Postgres and some of

12
0:01:21.400 --> 0:01:27.640
the things that work for us. What I want to talk about first is motivation.

13
0:01:27.640 --> 0:01:33.880
This is something a lot of people are going to talk about. We take it for granted that

14
0:01:33.880 --> 0:01:38.160
people are going to come to us, but why do they come to us? Why do they want to be involved

15
0:01:38.160 --> 0:01:45.360
in open source? What interests them? Why are they even giving their time to us? It's a

16
0:01:45.360 --> 0:01:51.360
trench question. Talk a little bit about open source management and how we manage open source

17
0:01:51.360 --> 0:01:56.640
projects. I'll talk a little bit about the development process.

18
0:01:56.640 --> 0:02:02.080
Open source motivations. This is actually from a study done in 2002 published in the

19
0:02:02.080 --> 0:02:07.720
register URL here right at the bottom. By the way, these slides are actually on my website.

20
0:02:07.720 --> 0:02:14.080
If you want to go here, feel free to get the slides and do whatever you want with them.

21
0:02:14.080 --> 0:02:20.200
What they basically did is a survey, and they found that the major motivations for people

22
0:02:20.200 --> 0:02:25.560
getting involved with open source were professional advancement, learning new skills. That's probably

23
0:02:25.560 --> 0:02:31.000
what got me involved in new skills. Practical need for the software. Maybe they

24
0:02:31.000 --> 0:02:36.680
have a business need for the software to be enhanced. There's a lot of people in the Postgres

25
0:02:36.680 --> 0:02:42.360
community like that. Or their business wants the software to thrive. Now that's my employer,

26
0:02:42.360 --> 0:02:48.320
EDB, wants Postgres to thrive, so they pay me to do my crazy thing.

27
0:02:48.320 --> 0:02:53.960
Professional stimulation is actually a valid reason to get involved. That was actually

28
0:02:53.960 --> 0:02:59.520
one of my also reasons for getting involved. I was always curious how a relational database

29
0:02:59.520 --> 0:03:03.760
worked, and Postgres was open source so I could actually see it work. It was exciting

30
0:03:03.760 --> 0:03:09.240
to me. Finally, the belief in open source, the belief

31
0:03:09.240 --> 0:03:18.240
that open source is a good, and therefore I want to invest in that. These are the four

32
0:03:18.240 --> 0:03:23.960
big ones. I'll tell you the real thing that nobody talks about is if you go up to somebody

33
0:03:23.960 --> 0:03:29.480
who works in open source, you say, which one of these are you? They may not even know.

34
0:03:29.480 --> 0:03:36.360
They may not even know. The weird part of it is that they all work together.

35
0:03:36.360 --> 0:03:42.880
I love the mental stimulation aspect. I actually have a need for it. I'm learning new skills

36
0:03:42.880 --> 0:03:47.040
and everybody helped me in my career. The open source stuff is cool. I like helping

37
0:03:47.040 --> 0:03:54.560
them. Which one is it? It's all of them mushed together. I may be able to give you percentages

38
0:03:54.560 --> 0:04:00.840
a little bit, but that's part of the beauty of it. Usually, if I say somebody, go dig

39
0:04:00.840 --> 0:04:04.440
a ditch, they're going to say, okay, how much are you going to give me for digging a ditch?

40
0:04:04.440 --> 0:04:09.680
They know what's motivating them because they just don't want to dig a ditch. For open source

41
0:04:09.680 --> 0:04:19.280
software, it's like multiple motivations all working together and flowing together. Healthy

42
0:04:19.280 --> 0:04:25.200
open source projects are able to have all of those aspects working at the same time.

43
0:04:25.200 --> 0:04:31.840
If you focus on just one of them, which I know some projects do, you're really not taking

44
0:04:31.840 --> 0:04:42.480
advantage of the full spectrum of ways of attracting developers. I know this is kind

45
0:04:42.480 --> 0:04:46.960
of, I never heard anybody talk of before, but when you see it in writing, you're like,

46
0:04:46.960 --> 0:04:51.320
yeah, I guess that does kind of make sense because that's kind of how I got involved.

47
0:04:51.320 --> 0:04:57.080
That's what motivates me. There's all this kind of stuff that doesn't really make sense,

48
0:04:57.080 --> 0:05:06.040
but actually it actually does. I mentioned mental stimulation. Programming is where there's

49
0:05:06.040 --> 0:05:15.080
unusual activities that does not require any upfront money. As long as you have a computer,

50
0:05:15.080 --> 0:05:20.600
you can do as much programming as you want. You're not paying per hour or paying per

51
0:05:20.600 --> 0:05:26.880
piece or paying for wire or paying for fabrication of some kind of equipment. It's basically

52
0:05:26.880 --> 0:05:36.280
a malleable and a cost-free medium that you can continue changing. That cost-free aspect

53
0:05:36.280 --> 0:05:41.640
actually helps people get involved. With Postgres particularly, it's kind of a puzzle to solve

54
0:05:41.640 --> 0:05:48.600
some of the problems we have to do. How many people like puzzles? It's kind of fun. Postgres

55
0:05:48.600 --> 0:05:52.760
has a ton of puzzles that are really hard and a whole bunch of people would love to

56
0:05:52.760 --> 0:05:57.440
work together to solve them. That's one of the things that attracts people. It kind of

57
0:05:57.440 --> 0:06:03.040
makes sense. They wouldn't say it this way, but when you look at the people and they look

58
0:06:03.040 --> 0:06:06.720
at the way they talk and you kind of look, it kind of squint your eye a little bit. You're

59
0:06:06.720 --> 0:06:10.680
like, yeah, that's really what's kind of... Oh, and the other parts as well because they have

60
0:06:10.680 --> 0:06:15.880
a good paying job. They like helping people and they like open source and it's helping

61
0:06:15.880 --> 0:06:21.320
their business. There's a whole bunch of things all going at the same time. They enjoy learning.

62
0:06:21.320 --> 0:06:25.600
There's just a whole bunch of stuff. Actually, this comes out of a book from I think the

63
0:06:25.600 --> 0:06:34.360
70s, the mythical man month. We're going way, way back here in terms of understanding why

64
0:06:34.360 --> 0:06:39.600
programming is interesting. We're kind of, I feel as open source people and of course

65
0:06:39.600 --> 0:06:48.080
the Postgres person, we're kind of... There's a term in English, you're running on all cylinders.

66
0:06:48.080 --> 0:06:55.360
All of you have an engine and all of the cylinders are working in the same way in a uniform fashion

67
0:06:55.360 --> 0:06:59.400
for the same purpose. That's kind of what we have here and that's kind of what we have

68
0:06:59.400 --> 0:07:05.240
here. What I'm saying is that to build open source projects, you're not going to open

69
0:07:05.240 --> 0:07:10.400
with these things, but be aware that these are aspects and aspects that you're going

70
0:07:10.400 --> 0:07:15.400
to attract different people who have different focuses and different things that motivate

71
0:07:15.400 --> 0:07:21.600
them. Let's talk a little bit about management.

72
0:07:21.600 --> 0:07:26.200
Obviously managing an open source project is incredibly complicated. Having done it

73
0:07:26.200 --> 0:07:33.600
for so long and having done it really when open source was much smaller. Obviously, communication

74
0:07:33.600 --> 0:07:40.160
is a key aspect, the ability to send free email. We didn't have chat back then really,

75
0:07:40.160 --> 0:07:47.800
but the ability to send communication freely across the globe and harness the capabilities

76
0:07:47.800 --> 0:07:54.800
of people who are very far away from me is incredibly important. You are going to have

77
0:07:54.800 --> 0:07:59.100
issues with just being able to communicate potentially with email. You may not meet the

78
0:07:59.100 --> 0:08:04.240
people that you're working with. You have travel distance challenges. You have time

79
0:08:04.240 --> 0:08:11.200
zone distance challenges. When I was working on the port of Postgres to Windows, I had

80
0:08:11.200 --> 0:08:16.400
one person in Stockholm who's actually at the conference and another person in Sydney,

81
0:08:16.400 --> 0:08:23.400
Australia. Based on their availability, I would wake up in the morning and I would work

82
0:08:23.400 --> 0:08:32.880
with the person in Stockholm because he would prefer to work in his evening time. Then I

83
0:08:32.880 --> 0:08:38.040
would go through the day and then at night I would work with the person in Sydney because

84
0:08:38.040 --> 0:08:43.040
that person liked to work in their daytime. I had this weird thing where I'd work really

85
0:08:43.040 --> 0:08:50.360
hard from seven to nine in the morning and from 10 to midnight. The rest of the day was

86
0:08:50.360 --> 0:08:57.400
kind of like, yeah. The culture is going to be different. Different cultures are going

87
0:08:57.400 --> 0:09:03.360
to have different focuses. One of the things I try to do is to make fit into the culture

88
0:09:03.360 --> 0:09:09.400
I'm visiting or the people I'm working with. Sometimes that's uncomfortable, but I think

89
0:09:09.400 --> 0:09:15.840
it's important. Language, obviously, that's a huge challenge. I'm speaking in English.

90
0:09:15.840 --> 0:09:21.680
You're understanding English, but I realize, A, I'm not sure how successful I would have

91
0:09:21.680 --> 0:09:26.720
been if I had to do everything in French or Flemish or German. I don't know if I would

92
0:09:26.720 --> 0:09:32.440
have been capable of being the communicator I am if I had to go learn another language

93
0:09:32.440 --> 0:09:39.760
to be involved. How can we bridge that gap? I feel I'm very lucky and blessed to be able

94
0:09:39.760 --> 0:09:45.440
to speak in English and you have to understand English, but that's not everybody. How can

95
0:09:45.440 --> 0:09:50.520
we work with people who have trouble learning languages or just don't have the opportunity

96
0:09:50.520 --> 0:09:56.320
to learn languages? How can we show what we value their contributions and we want to then

97
0:09:56.320 --> 0:10:02.400
be part of our community and how to... I could have a whole talk just on that. You

98
0:10:02.400 --> 0:10:11.200
can imagine. Funding, I'll talk about that in a minute. Communication, so I'm pretty

99
0:10:11.200 --> 0:10:20.280
good at that. One of the people, one of our community members said, early on they said

100
0:10:20.280 --> 0:10:26.040
to get new people in the community, we just need Bruce Monchene telephone. I used to call

101
0:10:26.040 --> 0:10:30.440
people just in the middle of the day and talk to them about whatever they wanted to talk

102
0:10:30.440 --> 0:10:37.240
about who are regular community members. I may be calling Germany, I may be calling the

103
0:10:37.240 --> 0:10:44.560
other side of the country, the United States, but that personal contact meant a lot. It

104
0:10:44.560 --> 0:10:48.600
showed you I care about what you're doing, I want to know you. I don't necessarily want

105
0:10:48.600 --> 0:10:52.760
to know what you're doing for the community. I want to know you as you. If you want to

106
0:10:52.760 --> 0:10:57.280
do something for the community, that's fine, but that's not my focus. When I go to visit

107
0:10:57.280 --> 0:11:03.400
and I travel quite a bit, maybe 30 some events a year, I'm not there to tell you about our

108
0:11:03.400 --> 0:11:09.880
software. I'm not here to tell you about my software either. I am here to get to know

109
0:11:09.880 --> 0:11:16.200
you. I am here to understand how we can help you and how we can work together in whatever

110
0:11:16.200 --> 0:11:22.480
you feel you want to work on. I don't have an agenda. My employer fortunately doesn't

111
0:11:22.480 --> 0:11:29.880
have an agenda for me. My title is evangelist and postgres evangelist or open source evangelist,

112
0:11:29.880 --> 0:11:34.920
whatever you want to call it. I am not here to sell you to use anything. I'm not even

113
0:11:34.920 --> 0:11:43.000
here to tell you to use postgres. I remember I was in Sri Lanka once and somebody held

114
0:11:43.000 --> 0:11:47.400
up his hand and said, why would I use postgres instead of MySQL? This was like 20 years

115
0:11:47.400 --> 0:11:56.120
ago. I said, I don't know. Maybe, I don't know. If you want to use it, fine. I'm not

116
0:11:56.120 --> 0:12:03.720
here to tell you. I'm not here to tell you why it has some features you might like. I'm

117
0:12:03.720 --> 0:12:09.600
not here to convince you. I'm here to get you involved if you want to be involved. Instant

118
0:12:09.600 --> 0:12:15.200
messaging, I've actually found it to be really almost better sometimes in the phone now because

119
0:12:15.200 --> 0:12:19.800
everyone's on. Typically, Telegram is huge. If you're not using Telegram, that's usually

120
0:12:19.800 --> 0:12:29.800
what I use for Europe, Russia. Asia's a little harder. There's WeChat in China. I'm not sure

121
0:12:29.800 --> 0:12:35.040
I do a whole lot of chatting with Japan or Korea. I have a couple of Korea guys on Telegram

122
0:12:35.040 --> 0:12:40.360
now that I think of it. I mean, Google Chat. We don't do too much with Facebook or at least

123
0:12:40.360 --> 0:12:46.320
I don't. I'm sure some of my people do. Being able to just chat somebody and say, hey, did

124
0:12:46.320 --> 0:12:51.160
you look at this or how you doing or did this problem in your country cause you a problem

125
0:12:51.160 --> 0:12:57.560
or how you feeling or... Wow, that was an amazing email you sent or I loved it, that

126
0:12:57.560 --> 0:13:05.440
patch you did. These little things, it doesn't cost you anything. I might send him $100.

127
0:13:05.440 --> 0:13:10.200
I'm just talking to him and I'm saying, you did a great job. Frankly, I was down there

128
0:13:10.200 --> 0:13:15.960
at the Postgres booth just before I came up here. I said, this booth looks great. I said

129
0:13:15.960 --> 0:13:20.400
the dev room we have looks fantastic. We got a Postgres banner out front of the building.

130
0:13:20.400 --> 0:13:24.520
There's a banner right near the entrance to the room. We've got people in blue vests that

131
0:13:24.520 --> 0:13:28.400
say elephant herd are on the back. They're sort of helping people get into the room.

132
0:13:28.400 --> 0:13:32.960
I'm like, we look like a million bucks here. I don't know what you guys are doing. This

133
0:13:32.960 --> 0:13:38.400
is great. Didn't cost me anything, but they did a lot of work. Somebody had to make those

134
0:13:38.400 --> 0:13:41.600
requests. These people are volunteering their time. Somebody had to bring the banners. They

135
0:13:41.600 --> 0:13:45.160
got to put them in their car and bring them here. Nothing worse than doing something and

136
0:13:45.160 --> 0:13:50.800
have nobody care about it. There's a lot of people who do stuff and nobody cares. Even

137
0:13:50.800 --> 0:13:56.640
if people appreciate it, nobody tells them they appreciate it. It does not cost you anything

138
0:13:56.640 --> 0:14:01.680
to tell somebody you appreciate what they do. It doesn't diminish you. It doesn't make

139
0:14:01.680 --> 0:14:05.640
you look foolish. They're probably going to thank you and it's going to mean a lot to

140
0:14:05.640 --> 0:14:11.280
them. That's a key aspect of building any type of community, particularly a community

141
0:14:11.280 --> 0:14:21.320
where nobody gets paid. I know this sounds obvious, but a lot of people don't do it. That's

142
0:14:21.320 --> 0:14:32.600
my soapbox. I'm sorry about that. I travel a lot and there's a lot of people who help

143
0:14:32.600 --> 0:14:38.800
me get to where I am and help me find things and help me in the hotels and airports and

144
0:14:38.800 --> 0:14:42.800
stuff. I say thank you. Thank you for helping me. Thank you for working on Sunday. I know

145
0:14:42.800 --> 0:14:50.840
you'd rather be home. I think it makes a big difference. It's a mind change. It's a mind

146
0:14:50.840 --> 0:14:55.960
change of what type of person you want to be. It's not just an open source. It's basically

147
0:14:55.960 --> 0:14:59.560
what type of person. You want to be a grateful person who thanks others for helping them.

148
0:14:59.560 --> 0:15:03.040
You just want to worry about yourself and just get your thing done. Whatever happens

149
0:15:03.040 --> 0:15:07.880
to those other people who helped you, right? A lot of people that way, but you're not going

150
0:15:07.880 --> 0:15:12.520
to be a leader if you're that way. That's not the type of leader. In fact, there's a

151
0:15:12.520 --> 0:15:18.160
really interesting... I go to a lot of leader conferences and there's basically seven, six

152
0:15:18.160 --> 0:15:24.880
type of leaders. There's the innovative leader. There's the managerial leader. There's the

153
0:15:24.880 --> 0:15:30.360
sort of organizational leader. One of them is probably most important for open source

154
0:15:30.360 --> 0:15:37.680
is the servant leader. The leader who is a servant to the people who report to them and

155
0:15:37.680 --> 0:15:42.160
wants the best to happen to everyone who's reporting to them. That's the type of leader

156
0:15:42.160 --> 0:15:46.200
you have to be an open source because you have no money. You have no control over these

157
0:15:46.200 --> 0:15:51.160
people. They are helping you out of their own voluntary. If they stop doing it, there's

158
0:15:51.160 --> 0:15:58.160
nothing you can do. A lot of management focuses on rewarding people and paying them and stuff,

159
0:15:58.160 --> 0:16:03.880
but honestly, servant leader for open source, you can search for it. There's a lot of talks

160
0:16:03.880 --> 0:16:07.920
about it. It's actually really interesting. One of the things I found in terms of conferences,

161
0:16:07.920 --> 0:16:16.920
and this is a good example, I travel about 90 days a year when COVID isn't happening.

162
0:16:16.920 --> 0:16:25.080
I found that going to somebody's country and spending time with them and staying an extra

163
0:16:25.080 --> 0:16:28.800
day after the conference and just hanging out with them and doing whatever they want

164
0:16:28.800 --> 0:16:35.520
to do is gold. The conference itself, yeah, okay, people hear me talk and I'm talking

165
0:16:35.520 --> 0:16:39.320
about Postgres features and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, yeah, maybe I'm good

166
0:16:39.320 --> 0:16:45.640
at that or maybe, yeah, they can see my slides online and it's not the same maybe, but a

167
0:16:45.640 --> 0:16:50.480
lot of what I do is not just peaking to small groups but spending time with individuals

168
0:16:50.480 --> 0:16:55.720
in their countries just doing whatever they want to do. Hey, let's go to the park. Let's

169
0:16:55.720 --> 0:17:00.840
go to the zoo. Let's show me something interesting and it's unbelievable some of the stuff I've

170
0:17:00.840 --> 0:17:05.880
seen by just asking somebody, hey, I'm here for an extra day after the conference. If

171
0:17:05.880 --> 0:17:10.880
you want to do anything, let me know. You don't know what's going to happen to you.

172
0:17:10.880 --> 0:17:17.120
Honestly, it's a little scary. You'll notice I have shoes on but they actually have high

173
0:17:17.120 --> 0:17:22.200
top shoes because a lot of times when I'm traveling, I don't know what climb I'm going

174
0:17:22.200 --> 0:17:26.760
to be going up. Particularly in Russia, I seem to be ending up on top of a mountain

175
0:17:26.760 --> 0:17:35.920
or in a forest or covered in snow or just places I never would have thought I'd go.

176
0:17:35.920 --> 0:17:41.840
But again, I have to be flexible. I can't be this weird. Anyway, it's actually kind

177
0:17:41.840 --> 0:17:54.520
of crazy and that investment pays back. It really does. One of the issues I had is, yeah,

178
0:17:54.520 --> 0:18:01.000
email is nice. Talking to somebody on chat is better. Talking to somebody by voice is

179
0:18:01.000 --> 0:18:09.920
better than that. Going to them is the best. I'll tell you a story. Shirley, are you here

180
0:18:09.920 --> 0:18:17.960
or are you left? Shirley's here? No. I have shoes right back. In 2000, I want to say three,

181
0:18:17.960 --> 0:18:24.040
I was at a show. I used to work for OSCON. I went to OSCON in San Diego. I fly out there.

182
0:18:24.040 --> 0:18:28.960
I didn't travel very much at that point. I fly out to San Diego and it was in a hotel

183
0:18:28.960 --> 0:18:34.840
right on the water. I had a tutorial and a talk. I gave my tutorial. There's probably

184
0:18:34.840 --> 0:18:40.880
like 40 people there. Then I gave my talk the next day and there's like 30 people there.

185
0:18:40.880 --> 0:18:46.920
I'm like, okay, so I talked to like 70 people. I'm on the plane flying home. I'm like, that

186
0:18:46.920 --> 0:18:52.240
was a waste of time. I sent an email. Thousands of people see it. I just flew across the country,

187
0:18:52.240 --> 0:18:58.040
spent like four days, five days to talk to 70 people. I'm telling my wife, we're not

188
0:18:58.040 --> 0:19:06.400
doing the same one. It's 2003. I think I've traveled like 1200 days since then, but anyway.

189
0:19:06.400 --> 0:19:12.920
The stats are on my website. What I found out is the next week when I was looking at

190
0:19:12.920 --> 0:19:17.080
the Postgres email list, there was a lot of activity that wasn't there the week that I

191
0:19:17.080 --> 0:19:21.200
left. The week before OSCON, the week after OSCON, I had a lot more activity after the

192
0:19:21.200 --> 0:19:28.480
week. What I realized was the people I had lunch with at OSCON were now the people who

193
0:19:28.480 --> 0:19:33.720
were actively working in Postgres. I don't know how it happened. I don't know what magic

194
0:19:33.720 --> 0:19:39.160
words I said. Who knows? The point is it wasn't, I'm not even sure it was the people in my

195
0:19:39.160 --> 0:19:44.280
talk. I think it was the people I talked to at lunch. I talked to them. I got to know

196
0:19:44.280 --> 0:19:47.880
them. I talked about, I guess I must have said something about Postgres or they asked

197
0:19:47.880 --> 0:19:52.920
me something about Postgres. I talked about it. All of a sudden, we were going. I don't

198
0:19:52.920 --> 0:19:59.320
know. Magnus Huygendur, who was actually one of the core team members as well, he's here.

199
0:19:59.320 --> 0:20:06.280
I went to a conference early on, probably 2004 in... It was in Denmark, Sta. Copenhagen.

200
0:20:06.280 --> 0:20:12.880
Yeah, I had my clock right here. I'm good. Away at Copenhagen. Again, it was a very early

201
0:20:12.880 --> 0:20:19.560
trip. I remember flying... It was a crazy flight out at JFK in the snow. I remember

202
0:20:19.560 --> 0:20:24.640
arriving. I don't know. I talked to the guy. It was Magnus. I don't know. I didn't even

203
0:20:24.640 --> 0:20:31.520
know what Magnus meant. I didn't know Magnus was a name because I'm from the United States.

204
0:20:31.520 --> 0:20:35.000
I'm talking to him and he's talking to me about stuff and okay, whatever. I talked to

205
0:20:35.000 --> 0:20:39.560
a bunch of other people. Then I came back from Copenhagen. All of a sudden, Magnus is

206
0:20:39.560 --> 0:20:44.760
involved and he's working an email list. I'm like, oh, this is great. Little did I know,

207
0:20:44.760 --> 0:20:49.640
he would end up being the president of Postgres. You're up and a core team member. You don't

208
0:20:49.640 --> 0:20:55.480
know. You don't know who you're going to talk to. I will tell you, travel is time consuming.

209
0:20:55.480 --> 0:21:01.280
There's only a few people in any one location, but if you can do it and you have the time

210
0:21:01.280 --> 0:21:08.360
to invest in a long-term goal, it pays off tremendously. Time zones, obviously, we all

211
0:21:08.360 --> 0:21:14.680
work in multiple time zones. I've always worked from home, so I don't have it nine to five.

212
0:21:14.680 --> 0:21:22.680
My days have always been very long. I work in the morning and then I work through the

213
0:21:22.680 --> 0:21:27.160
day, but I may take two hours off, three hours off in the middle of the day to go shopping

214
0:21:27.160 --> 0:21:31.880
or go visit somebody or go to church. I don't know, whatever. I never really worried about

215
0:21:31.880 --> 0:21:42.440
it because the work's always there. The people in Asia are awake. It's actually kind of a

216
0:21:42.440 --> 0:21:46.880
long-term. Having a cell phone is nice because you can communicate when you're not home,

217
0:21:46.880 --> 0:21:52.840
but it is a 24-hour cycle. There's something happening all the time and that is a little

218
0:21:52.840 --> 0:21:54.920
hard to get used to.

219
0:21:54.920 --> 0:21:59.680
Culture show interest in other cultures. Don't be the person who, oh, I don't do it that

220
0:21:59.680 --> 0:22:07.280
way or that's wrong that you do it that way. We had a case where there was an inappropriate

221
0:22:07.280 --> 0:22:11.000
something at a conference in Russia years ago and I had to call somebody up in the middle

222
0:22:11.000 --> 0:22:18.440
of the night. I called him at his 1 a.m. and he answered the phone. I kind of talked to

223
0:22:18.440 --> 0:22:25.800
him about the issue and he was able to resolve it by the time everyone got up the next day.

224
0:22:25.800 --> 0:22:31.800
Again, I already had personal contact with that individual. That individual had already

225
0:22:31.800 --> 0:22:36.920
sent his daughter to live with me for a summer to learn English. I knew him and his family

226
0:22:36.920 --> 0:22:43.280
very well. He answered my phone at 1 a.m. I said there's concern about this thing that

227
0:22:43.280 --> 0:22:47.440
happened at the conference. I got all the information I need. I talked to the court

228
0:22:47.440 --> 0:22:55.560
committee and we handled it very cleanly. Again, I had already invested in that relationship

229
0:22:55.560 --> 0:23:01.360
long before I needed to call that person at 1 a.m. to get an answer so that things didn't

230
0:23:01.360 --> 0:23:07.400
get out of hand. Turned out they didn't understand. This was part of the package they bought and

231
0:23:07.400 --> 0:23:14.160
we're like what country has a package like that? But whatever. You have to be culturally

232
0:23:14.160 --> 0:23:19.320
understanding sometimes. I spoke at a Russia conference in June and people were saying

233
0:23:19.320 --> 0:23:28.120
don't do that. We don't discriminate against where somebody lives. How do I do that? I

234
0:23:28.120 --> 0:23:33.080
start the talk and I said I want to say something before I talk about my material. I said I

235
0:23:33.080 --> 0:23:40.200
know it's a very hard time for people in Russia but it's an even harder time for people in

236
0:23:40.200 --> 0:23:48.480
Ukraine and the people and the Ukrainians. I said I work for a project that does not have

237
0:23:48.480 --> 0:23:52.960
boundaries between individuals. We don't discriminate on where somebody lives. It's in that spirit

238
0:23:52.960 --> 0:23:57.000
I'd like to talk to you today. I said the one sad thing is that I have been in Russia

239
0:23:57.000 --> 0:24:03.400
many times and I have. I said I'm sad to think it's going to be a long time until I can come

240
0:24:03.400 --> 0:24:08.560
back and see you again in Russia. The feedback I got from them was they really appreciated

241
0:24:08.560 --> 0:24:13.640
me saying that. I was able to talk about Ukraine. I was able to talk about Russia at the same

242
0:24:13.640 --> 0:24:20.440
time and I think in a balanced way and they appreciated somebody was willing to talk about

243
0:24:20.440 --> 0:24:26.800
that. Again I spent a lot of time thinking about what am I going to say to them and how

244
0:24:26.800 --> 0:24:34.000
am I going to make sure that I say the right words. They appreciated it and I continued

245
0:24:34.000 --> 0:24:39.640
to have a regular dialogue with them. We had a lot of developers in Russia still who continue

246
0:24:39.640 --> 0:24:46.640
to work on our project. We don't discriminate against them basically. Language can be an

247
0:24:46.640 --> 0:24:52.080
issue. We do have some cases where we try and do per language. Remember I talked about

248
0:24:52.080 --> 0:24:58.560
the language barrier. We have a French email list. We have a Spanish email list. We have

249
0:24:58.560 --> 0:25:03.760
a Japanese email list, a Chinese email list. There's a whole bunch of per language lists

250
0:25:03.760 --> 0:25:08.800
to get people started. We have per language I believe it's telegram channels. I know we

251
0:25:08.800 --> 0:25:12.920
have a big Russian telegram channel. I don't remember what other languages we have. I know

252
0:25:12.920 --> 0:25:18.000
we have Slack channels for particular languages. We have obviously conferences all over the

253
0:25:18.000 --> 0:25:22.320
world. Many of them are in some of them are native languages. Some of them are in English.

254
0:25:22.320 --> 0:25:27.480
Some of them are both are translated. So when I go to Japan there's typically a translator

255
0:25:27.480 --> 0:25:32.680
there. When I go to Russia often there's a translator China as well. So again depending

256
0:25:32.680 --> 0:25:38.960
we have different documentation in different languages. Funding we don't have any. So just

257
0:25:38.960 --> 0:25:45.040
get over that. Hopefully you'll find a company like mine who's worried about the health of

258
0:25:45.040 --> 0:25:49.400
the community as willing to invest in somebody as crazy as me who just says these things

259
0:25:49.400 --> 0:25:56.840
and goes around and does whatever. And the reason is because they're investing so that

260
0:25:56.840 --> 0:26:02.640
if there's a problem he already knows everyone who can get the problem fixed real cleanly

261
0:26:02.640 --> 0:26:08.560
and that's again one of the investments. Development process we try and involve everybody. Find

262
0:26:08.560 --> 0:26:13.240
each person's motivation. Remember different people are motivated by different things so

263
0:26:13.240 --> 0:26:17.520
figure out what the motivator then and try and put them into position where they're going

264
0:26:17.520 --> 0:26:23.880
to be strong. I don't know how to put this but none of us is perfect. We all have problems

265
0:26:23.880 --> 0:26:28.960
things we do wrong. So I try and look at a person say what is your strength and what

266
0:26:28.960 --> 0:26:32.600
are the weaknesses. How can I put them in a place where your strengths are going to shine

267
0:26:32.600 --> 0:26:40.040
and we kind of have somebody backstopping the weaknesses so that doesn't become a problem.

268
0:26:40.040 --> 0:26:44.760
Reach out to individuals again that personal contact is important. Harvest the strength

269
0:26:44.760 --> 0:26:48.360
of the team. There's always somebody smaller than you. I learned that early on there was

270
0:26:48.360 --> 0:26:54.840
a guy in Krasnoyarsk Russia who was so smart early on not only could not answer his questions

271
0:26:54.840 --> 0:26:58.440
I didn't even understand why he'd answer the question. So I'd say I don't know the answer

272
0:26:58.440 --> 0:27:02.320
but why are you asking the question. Oh because of this and this. Oh okay I understand it

273
0:27:02.320 --> 0:27:07.640
but now I at least understand why he asked the question. Produce work that people are

274
0:27:07.640 --> 0:27:14.640
proud of. I'm not always Mr. Sunshine sometimes if I think if I'm embarrassed by something

275
0:27:14.640 --> 0:27:19.560
my community members will hear about it. In fact somebody just told me today I railed

276
0:27:19.560 --> 0:27:24.640
against how our website looked. It was kind of stuck in an ugly years ago in Dallas. He

277
0:27:24.640 --> 0:27:29.560
remembered where it was and what year it was and he said you didn't like the website and

278
0:27:29.560 --> 0:27:34.720
you basically said you were going to yell at everybody. He said I don't care what you

279
0:27:34.720 --> 0:27:39.440
do to the website do something because we were stuck and we couldn't we were stuck

280
0:27:39.440 --> 0:27:44.280
trying to look for something perfect. I said just do something and that kind of like got

281
0:27:44.280 --> 0:27:51.560
us over the hill. Produce clean code. Remember we're not paying people to code so we better

282
0:27:51.560 --> 0:27:58.200
make it easy. All right. And finally let manage the team lead by example not from authority.

283
0:27:58.200 --> 0:28:05.200
This is a big thing. I didn't realize it myself but but if the leadership the leadership really

284
0:28:05.200 --> 0:28:10.920
has an unspoken control over how the project and how the team works. If you have toxic

285
0:28:10.920 --> 0:28:15.760
leadership at the top you're not going to have a role on team at the bottom. If you

286
0:28:15.760 --> 0:28:21.320
have a servant leadership at the top you're you're the people underneath you will be servants

287
0:28:21.320 --> 0:28:26.880
to those below and so forth and will continue promoting people up and up into more powerful

288
0:28:26.880 --> 0:28:34.200
positions. That is absolutely a key aspect. I've been surprised at how well that works

289
0:28:34.200 --> 0:28:39.400
except failure gracefully when I make mistakes I'm like I'm sorry and when I say I'm sorry

290
0:28:39.400 --> 0:28:44.320
and I say I made a mistake it opens the door for other people when they make mistakes to

291
0:28:44.320 --> 0:28:50.240
also say I made a mistake because if if Bruce can say he was wrong about this thing and

292
0:28:50.240 --> 0:28:55.400
basically take the lumps on it then oh I guess look it didn't hurt I guess I can do that

293
0:28:55.400 --> 0:28:59.680
too. Right. If I'm the type of person who ignores any mistake I make then that's going

294
0:28:59.680 --> 0:29:05.320
to that's how other people are going to do it. So see consensus the post community does

295
0:29:05.320 --> 0:29:18.480
that a lot. OK. Let me take some questions. We have one minute for one question. Who would

296
0:29:18.480 --> 0:29:25.920
like to be our one question in our one minute. I see a hand. I look. It's here. Yeah she's

297
0:29:25.920 --> 0:29:34.400
there. She's she's she's she's going to give me an easy one I'm sure. Hi Bruce. Hey. So

298
0:29:34.400 --> 0:29:39.200
here's my question. How do you find balance. I mean you said you take calls at 1 a.m. travel

299
0:29:39.200 --> 0:29:45.560
three months a year. You have wife you have children. How do you do that. Right. So the

300
0:29:45.560 --> 0:29:51.320
question is how do you find balance. Basically basically you have to just accept your failures.

301
0:29:51.320 --> 0:29:55.280
You have to accept that I'm not going to be everywhere that I'm not going to be able to

302
0:29:55.280 --> 0:30:00.360
fix every problem. I'm not going to be able to do everything. Right. And you now rely

303
0:30:00.360 --> 0:30:04.520
on your leaders. So for example a great example when I'm here at the conference I have no

304
0:30:04.520 --> 0:30:10.440
idea what's happening in the community. No idea because I trust all of our people who

305
0:30:10.440 --> 0:30:15.760
have been working for years on this. So when I travel I don't even bother reading the community

306
0:30:15.760 --> 0:30:19.440
email list. When I get back I'll take a look at it and you know nothing bad happens when

307
0:30:19.440 --> 0:30:25.640
I'm gone. So what I realize is not to be anxious about things to trust the people who are part

308
0:30:25.640 --> 0:30:30.800
of your organization to handle it. And we're by showing by showing confidence in them they

309
0:30:30.800 --> 0:30:35.640
become confident. If you show you're not confident then they will not be confident. It's kind

310
0:30:35.640 --> 0:30:42.640
of natural. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye bye.
