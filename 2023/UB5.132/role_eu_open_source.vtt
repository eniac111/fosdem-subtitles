WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.440
Okay, good. Thank you. Well, I'm Gal Blondin. I work for the Eclipse Foundation.

00:14.440 --> 00:20.640
Hello. Can you hear me? Is it working fine? Yeah. Well, I'm the other one.

00:20.640 --> 00:29.320
Alberto, from Open Nebula. And the topic today, so actually that was a proposal from Alberto.

00:29.320 --> 00:37.120
About how about we talk together at first about European Open Source.

00:37.120 --> 00:43.000
So I think you proposed the topic and I proposed the title, which is,

00:43.000 --> 00:50.400
is European Open Source a thing? Because well, over the last, I don't know, two,

00:50.400 --> 00:59.280
three years, maybe more, I have been in lots of events where I see people who want to do

00:59.280 --> 01:04.240
more Open Source because the thing that Open Source is good for Europe. But at some point,

01:04.240 --> 01:10.080
there is always somebody who start with the idea that, well, Open Source is cool,

01:10.080 --> 01:16.240
but what about we would do Open Source and try to limit it to European companies,

01:16.240 --> 01:22.440
to European stakeholders or stuff like that. And so that's what we want to discuss today.

01:22.440 --> 01:30.640
So we prepared it like a list of questions. We expect that some of you maybe want to

01:30.640 --> 01:36.800
change your point of view. I think that we will have different point of views on some

01:36.800 --> 01:43.680
of the topics. And well, let's start. Do you want to define European Open Source?

01:43.680 --> 01:51.840
Okay. Well, I would like to explain a bit how selfish I am because this whole session for me

01:51.840 --> 02:07.480
personally is... Second. Louder, like that. No, but you need to use the microphone because we are

02:07.480 --> 02:25.760
recording. Okay. Yes. Okay. So I just wanted to explain for me personally what this session

02:25.760 --> 02:32.160
means. As Gayle has mentioned, the concept of European Open Source has been around for a while.

02:32.160 --> 02:42.120
It's been in the last three, four years that it's been discussed within this new geopolitical

02:42.120 --> 02:48.960
environment in which we all live now, and also especially at European level. So for me,

02:48.960 --> 02:54.000
I'm one of the people that's actually pushing for this concept to be something different from other

02:54.000 --> 03:01.040
stuff. But I also, I can confess, I have my doubts about how we define European Open Source and where

03:01.040 --> 03:08.360
that is something that might be divisive or counterproductive. Even have my position, let's

03:08.360 --> 03:13.480
say, and that's also part of my job. And I'm happy to say both on my personal level and professional

03:13.480 --> 03:19.160
level, I agree on the things I kind of defend. But I also have as a European some doubts about

03:19.160 --> 03:23.480
this and what these might imply for the Open Source sector. So for me, this session is also

03:23.480 --> 03:28.400
about learning what all of you think about this. And just because we thought that it was about time

03:28.400 --> 03:34.160
to have an open discussion, an open debate within the European Open Source community, the implications

03:34.160 --> 03:42.240
that this concept might have. Yes, maybe just a few words about me. So I work for the Egyptian

03:42.240 --> 03:51.000
Foundation, which moved to its legal incorporation to Brussels two years ago. And that's very

03:51.000 --> 03:58.920
important for us that we are a global organization established in Brussels. Because when it comes

03:58.920 --> 04:05.400
to the answer to what is European Open Source, I think that from my perspective, at least Open

04:05.400 --> 04:12.280
Source and free software, that's everything we do where you can use, study, modify and redistribute

04:12.280 --> 04:17.920
the software. And there is nothing to do with Europe. So that must be done in Europe, outside

04:17.920 --> 04:22.880
Europe. Everything that is written in Europe should be usable everywhere else. We should be

04:22.880 --> 04:33.120
able to use. So that's really sticking to the definitions of the FSF and the open source

04:33.120 --> 04:44.520
definition. So still, I think that we can have a specific approach to Open Source in Europe. That's

04:44.520 --> 04:52.160
how we help European organizations, how we help European companies do more and understand better

04:52.160 --> 05:01.320
in Open Source. And that's also why I wanted to start with this topic, because every time I go in

05:01.320 --> 05:09.120
a conference, I have been in conferences where people were telling, yeah, well, we get money,

05:09.120 --> 05:15.120
we invest in Open Source, and then we have the problem that what we do in Open Source could be

05:15.120 --> 05:24.120
reused by non-European companies. I am thinking, oh, my God. Oh, that's so fucking wrong. Why do

05:24.120 --> 05:31.720
you do that? Why do you do that? So that's really one part of the message I wanted to share today. I

05:31.720 --> 05:40.600
think we agree on that. Still, I think that we should be more diligent in Europe about helping

05:40.600 --> 05:48.720
European organizations, helping European companies, helping universities do Open Source, produce Open

05:48.720 --> 05:56.080
Source, publish Open Source, and also be more ambitious about how to use Open Source as a vector

05:56.080 --> 06:06.760
to project technologies and to project ideas in the rest of the world. We can come back to that.

06:06.760 --> 06:13.800
Yep. So I think, I mean, from my perspective, coming from the European Open Source industry

06:13.800 --> 06:19.240
sector, let's say, as a technology provider, as a company that produces Open Source and makes money

06:19.240 --> 06:25.920
out of the services we provide to customers with this, I mean, I think we share that concern,

06:25.920 --> 06:30.600
that I mean, Open Source cannot be something that in any way limits who's going to use that,

06:30.600 --> 06:36.800
puts any barriers to who can improve the technology or contribute to that technology.

06:36.800 --> 06:43.960
From my perspective, I mean, I've also been involved at several of the European initiatives

06:43.960 --> 06:48.520
for things like data sovereignty and cloud sovereignty, these kinds of discussions,

06:48.520 --> 06:53.320
things like the European Alliance for Industrial Data Edge and Cloud. That's something that the

06:53.320 --> 06:59.800
European Commission launched a couple of years ago. So for me and other people in the sector,

06:59.800 --> 07:05.960
I would say, I think exploring this concept of what European Open Source means is kind of a natural

07:05.960 --> 07:11.720
step after we discuss the problem we have in the market now with cloud providers. So from our

07:11.720 --> 07:17.320
perspective is, okay, we have, we recognize, we identify there's a market failure in Europe in

07:17.320 --> 07:22.880
terms of access to different cloud providers or the dominance of a number of non-European

07:22.880 --> 07:29.600
hyperscalers, you all know the names. Let's fix that because the European players are playing in

07:29.600 --> 07:35.480
this advantage here. So for us, the next step is, okay, so what are the technologies that European

07:35.480 --> 07:41.680
cloud providers are using? Are those led by European organizations? Are those roadmaps

07:41.680 --> 07:48.200
defined in Europe or are those technologies defined and implemented by non-EU companies and

07:48.200 --> 07:53.320
organizations? So for us, it was like the next step, like, okay, what if we apply this sense of this

07:53.320 --> 07:58.880
concept of sovereignty of technological autonomy, let's say, also to the not just the proprietary

07:58.880 --> 08:04.840
software, but the open source software that supports all these cloud infrastructures and

08:04.840 --> 08:12.280
European cloud providers, but other companies as well. Can we do that? I mean, can we get some

08:12.280 --> 08:17.080
understanding of what that will imply for Europe in terms of getting the industry involved in

08:17.080 --> 08:21.800
producing and maintaining the technologies that they consume, not just being mere spectators of

08:21.800 --> 08:26.720
what all the companies and organizations produce outside Europe most of times. So that's the,

08:26.720 --> 08:35.840
that was the kind of the next discussion we had. Any question at some point? Or maybe somebody wants

08:35.840 --> 08:41.120
to shout and I'll say that. What do you think? What do you feel about the concept of European open

08:41.120 --> 09:01.240
source? It's an oxymoron. Why? Yeah, I just don't understand why you put that adjective in front of

09:01.240 --> 09:09.080
this nouns. Right? I mean, it's like, you can do that. It makes dramatic sense, but I don't understand

09:09.080 --> 09:22.760
what the meaning would be. So for me, it's working for the life. Yeah, it's working for the life. I

09:22.760 --> 09:32.600
think, I think we agree. And to be honest, that's definitely not the controversial part in it. I

09:32.600 --> 09:40.960
think that, and to the point is that yes, open source is global and everything that is, that

09:40.960 --> 09:53.040
intends to limit open source scope is certainly not what we want. Still, that's more to not take

09:53.040 --> 09:59.040
it as an adjective, but to take it as a, okay, we have open source, open source is global. And

09:59.040 --> 10:08.920
what we may want as European citizen working for a global organization or as another European citizen

10:08.920 --> 10:19.640
with leading a European company, what we may want is to have a different strategy, like an industry

10:19.640 --> 10:32.640
strategy to sustain and develop open source better differently in Europe. So I completely agree with

10:32.640 --> 10:39.680
that. Yeah. And so that you should have policies and frameworks and a whole bunch of other types of

10:39.680 --> 10:48.800
things. But to do so, let's use that example, right? Water forms the shape of the container that it's

10:48.800 --> 10:58.400
putting. Right? So one, one talks about the, the, what water is, right? One talks about the fact

10:58.400 --> 11:04.880
that it's in a bucket or in a cup or in something because the framework gives the structure to the

11:04.880 --> 11:11.400
water. But you don't talk about whether the water is going to be bucket, bucketed water. Yeah.

11:11.400 --> 11:21.520
We are not, we are not, okay. I'm French in Spanish, so it's possibly grammatically not the right

11:21.520 --> 11:42.760
approach to the topic in English. At least I think that we set the stage for the conversation. Yeah.

11:42.760 --> 11:55.720
So the comment is that it should be European open source industry. Yeah. And that's another aspect

11:55.720 --> 12:02.480
that I like a lot. Yeah. Because for me, I think it's the only concern I've heard, like why this

12:02.480 --> 12:11.280
matters, like is, it's the one about competition. So competition with US and other global companies.

12:11.280 --> 12:19.240
And that is predominantly sort of like an industry concern. I think for example, like there might be

12:19.240 --> 12:24.480
other concerns around sort of like governance of open source projects, like that are based in Europe

12:24.480 --> 12:29.800
or have predominantly sort of a European contributors and things like that. But from my experience,

12:29.800 --> 12:36.560
working with those projects, none of them have sort of, at least intentionally sort of isolationist

12:36.560 --> 12:41.480
sort of like tendencies, they might be isolated just by fact of like, who they know or not to

12:41.480 --> 12:46.360
have diversity of something like that. There's not, yeah, but there's not, it's not, it's less

12:46.360 --> 12:51.440
about lack of outreach rather than we want to be answered. I think most, most of these projects

12:51.440 --> 13:00.160
would rather be not seen as European, but rather as part of more open source movement. You want to

13:00.160 --> 13:07.160
correct? So if we could please just have the seekers call on anyone who wants to speak, we'll

13:07.160 --> 13:13.120
bring the mic to you. And then you have to speak really loudly into the mic. So but please call on

13:13.120 --> 13:21.960
people and let us know. We'll bring the mic to them. Okay. So my take on that is that yes, there

13:21.960 --> 13:27.160
is something that we could define as European open source industry. I think there's also something

13:27.160 --> 13:33.560
we could call the European open source technology. And from my perspective, that is that open source

13:33.560 --> 13:42.120
technology whose roadmap and whose governance is controlled by European organizations. That's

13:42.120 --> 13:49.760
mean external non EU actors cannot or contributors cannot join that community or contribute to that

13:49.760 --> 13:55.760
technology. But the roadmap, the vision of that technology, the values, if you want to talk about

13:55.760 --> 14:01.880
that, the governance bodies that control those technologies are under European hands. Sorry,

14:01.880 --> 14:11.240
before I have, I have slightly different opinion. And my opinion is here on this question seven,

14:11.240 --> 14:20.200
I think that definitely one of the advantages of open source is that we move the needle from having

14:20.200 --> 14:29.760
access to proprietary IP to having the skills to study, to understand, to master, to evolve, to

14:29.760 --> 14:39.400
develop the open source software. And I think that what we need to do, what is what's the next step?

14:39.400 --> 14:48.120
So you represent a relatively small company. And I think that we have a vibrant ecosystem of lots

14:48.120 --> 14:56.680
of small company, small open source companies in Europe. And I think that what we need to do to

14:56.680 --> 15:08.280
go to the next step instead in terms of European power in open source, technology impact in open

15:08.280 --> 15:17.920
source is to involve the larger companies. And in Europe, we have a characteristic which is that

15:17.920 --> 15:25.440
the larger companies are not software companies. With their automotive companies, their aircraft

15:25.440 --> 15:36.840
companies, their utilities, etc. So we have a lot that is being done in terms of policies in engaging

15:36.840 --> 15:45.520
the government. So we have government source pools, etc. But I think that if we really want to get

15:45.520 --> 15:55.440
more leadership from Europe in this topic of global open source, that's really when we manage

15:55.440 --> 16:04.040
to involve the big companies. So we work, for example, with automotive companies, mostly Germans,

16:04.040 --> 16:15.800
but we have Volkswagen, Mercedes, Bosch, Continental, ZF, etc. So that's companies that it's very

16:15.800 --> 16:24.440
interesting. Some of them have been doing software for a very long time, embedded software, etc. And

16:24.440 --> 16:33.000
they are slowly getting to use open source to collaborate together. I think that's very

16:33.000 --> 16:41.880
fundamental because they are likely about to create software that would be game changing for them,

16:41.880 --> 16:50.680
but also for the rest of the industry. So I think that there is a happy battle which is, okay,

16:50.680 --> 16:59.840
what can we do with open source? And on the other side, you have the big, the GAF arm and big

16:59.840 --> 17:07.600
software vendors. We don't have this big software industry in Europe. But open source is really a

17:07.600 --> 17:17.880
tactical and potentially strategic tool that can be used by all our industry. And one of the problems

17:17.880 --> 17:26.360
is that in this industry, all the managers, they have no clue about software. They have no clue

17:26.360 --> 17:34.280
about open source, even less. And so they hear about open source, like, oh, it's open, it's good,

17:34.280 --> 17:44.800
etc. And I think that collectively, we need to propagate the message that, well, doing open

17:44.800 --> 17:50.000
source is, you need to take care about your community, you need to take care, you need to

17:50.000 --> 17:56.960
have a governance, you need to have rules of code of conduct, etc. And so that's really something

17:56.960 --> 18:04.040
that may be counterintuitive for them when you talk to, I don't know, the CEO of an automotive

18:04.040 --> 18:09.560
company that may be counterintuitive for them that open source can be good for them. But I think

18:09.560 --> 18:16.800
that when it will be good for, when they engage with open source, that will also be good for you

18:16.800 --> 18:25.040
because they need you and that will really grow how we collaborate in open source. Because for the

18:25.040 --> 18:31.760
moment, and that's the reaction and what creates the fact that people want to talk about European

18:31.760 --> 18:38.040
open source, that's exactly what you describe in where is the governance. And for the moment,

18:38.040 --> 18:43.680
I can understand the frustration of some European actors, not the system integrators, because system

18:43.680 --> 18:50.120
integrators take the technologies, they create a solution with this technology, and whatever the

18:50.120 --> 18:56.760
technology comes from, they are happy. But for everybody else, to some extent, the fact that

18:56.760 --> 19:07.280
they have these, those open source technologies coming from mostly the US is okay. So what is our

19:07.280 --> 19:17.000
impact on it? Sorry, go ahead. Please, if you want to move away from IP, please do not refer to it as

19:17.000 --> 19:22.320
European open source, but put another word on it, like European open source initiative framework,

19:22.320 --> 19:29.200
community, something that refers to all the aspects aside from the software code. Because when you're

19:29.200 --> 19:34.200
talking about European open source, you think about the code, the IP, and all this stuff, with that,

19:34.200 --> 19:40.760
please use a framework or something that you describe the whole approach. So by the way,

19:40.760 --> 19:48.080
that's leadership. In my mind, more leadership maybe, so we put it somewhere in the screen.

19:48.080 --> 19:58.920
So when you skip away from IP and from non Europeans using open source software, and you can frame it

19:58.920 --> 20:05.160
in a better way. So please refer to it to like an initiative or framework or something that you can

20:05.160 --> 20:19.600
put multiple approaches to it. But please make a big please, please. Okay, just just quickly, I have

20:19.600 --> 20:25.400
one here, then I saw this one next, and there was one up there, then this one, and then here. So I

20:25.400 --> 20:38.920
will try my best. Okay, so this might not only work without the mask. One short question about

20:38.920 --> 20:44.000
the European open source debate. Have you ever considered not to try to frame it as a kind of

20:44.000 --> 20:49.600
license? Because we've seen from the development of the approach of the German carmakers to make

20:49.600 --> 20:56.280
a German car operating system that they paid horribly amounts of pain when they forked off

20:56.280 --> 21:02.680
certain line exports, and spend a triple digit amount of millions and something that they then

21:02.680 --> 21:11.160
had to scroll back. Thus, it might be more useful to go to open source and give them some kind of

21:11.160 --> 21:17.920
label as we are a company and we maintain it, and then eat the liability that comes with using open

21:17.920 --> 21:23.400
source and can be contracted given that the cyber resilience act applies companies in Europe to

21:23.400 --> 21:30.320
actually take the liabilities that come from using open source. So instead of making it a licensed

21:30.320 --> 21:36.040
thing, you basically go to a certain software stack that you maintain that you can still freely

21:36.040 --> 21:42.920
integrate developments from all over the world. And then you basically put a stamp on it like,

21:42.920 --> 21:49.360
if you want to use it, you can contact us and pay us a service level agreement to do the

21:49.360 --> 21:56.120
maintenance for that. And then we will also take the liability with regards to the liability that

21:56.120 --> 22:01.040
will come with the cyber resilience act, where companies have to accept the risks that come from

22:01.040 --> 22:07.320
open source and an IT security aspect. Would that be a different spin to actually fostering a money

22:07.320 --> 22:16.600
flow into European open source companies and actually create a business model? I don't know.

22:16.600 --> 22:33.640
We could try. Just a clarification, I mean, just put something that's going to be a real question

22:33.640 --> 22:39.760
that we'll have to answer in Europe in a few months time, I would say. So let's say we in Europe

22:39.760 --> 22:46.880
decide that we want to develop a specific piece of technology that we think it's crucial for Europe.

22:46.880 --> 22:53.440
We want that piece of technology to be open source. It's going to be funded by with European

22:53.440 --> 23:00.880
fundings and all this. We get, we managed to get the European industry on board, not just as a

23:00.880 --> 23:06.040
consumers of passive consumers of open source, but as active maintainers and developers of open

23:06.040 --> 23:14.400
source around this technology. And we want this technology in the long term to respond to European,

23:14.400 --> 23:23.280
to the priorities of the European Union in terms of the industry and the geostrategic priorities of

23:23.280 --> 23:30.840
the continent. We want that technology to respond to that. But how can we protect that from the

23:30.840 --> 23:39.040
same technology? It's a hyperscaler contributing with a thousand developers to that project and

23:39.040 --> 23:46.440
taking over the governance structures of that project. So how can we from that scenario protect

23:46.440 --> 23:53.920
that open source technology as I define that? Is that a way we can do that without excluding

23:53.920 --> 23:59.040
non-European companies from the government's bodies? I'm asking, because that's going to be a

23:59.040 --> 24:03.960
point to have to respond in a few weeks time enough. Sorry, in a few months time with thinking

24:03.960 --> 24:08.000
all the specific piece of technology that will be developing in Europe by the end of this year.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.720
It's probably going to be the largest open source project in Europe. Yeah, sorry.

24:14.720 --> 24:25.760
So here's next and then there was one over there, another over there, then over here and then over

24:25.760 --> 24:32.960
there. So yeah, a real quick question maybe, hopefully. I find it very difficult to discuss

24:32.960 --> 24:38.480
these topics in abstract terms. So I wonder, do you have concrete examples where kind of important

24:38.480 --> 24:44.800
open source projects, their project management, the governance exercise or, you know, the development

24:44.800 --> 24:51.800
happened against interests of European consumers, contributors. And if you have such concrete cases,

24:51.800 --> 24:58.080
do you know whether this is because the Europeans didn't get involved or because the decision was

24:58.080 --> 25:06.640
really done against them though they were engaged? Do you want to answer? Go ahead. Well, I mean,

25:06.640 --> 25:14.480
in terms of open source projects that are largely controlled, let's say, by non-EU companies or

25:14.480 --> 25:20.360
vendors, I mean, there are a number of examples there. You want me to give you some names?

25:20.360 --> 25:25.160
Not examples for the projects that I can understand, but where the decisions project

25:25.160 --> 25:30.720
management happened against European interests. I know that many open source projects are of course

25:30.720 --> 25:37.640
led by US companies and organizations and so forth, but I'm explicitly asking for, you know,

25:37.640 --> 25:44.520
controversial decisions, project management governance because... Sorry, so he's asking me

25:44.520 --> 25:51.480
for a specific examples in which European companies have been sidelined by in some decisions in open

25:51.480 --> 26:02.080
source projects. I don't know. Doesn't matter. It's about the risk. It's risk management. So how we

26:02.080 --> 26:08.080
prevent things from happening, how we prevent things, vendors from dropping their support to

26:08.080 --> 26:14.400
an open source project overnight and collapsing the sustainability of that project because

26:14.400 --> 26:20.040
in Europe we have relied for so long on non-European companies to develop these technologies and

26:20.040 --> 26:27.480
maintain them that we've lost the skills and the capabilities to take over. That's the problem.

26:27.480 --> 26:31.040
We're talking about thousands of millions of euros invested in technology. I'll give you an example

26:31.040 --> 26:34.920
of that. There's something called the important project of common European interest on next

26:34.920 --> 26:41.000
generation proud infrastructure and services. IPSI this. That's mobilizing thousands of millions

26:41.000 --> 26:47.360
from European funding to create a whole alternative stack of technologies for managing the cloud and

26:47.360 --> 26:53.360
the edge in Europe. That's only for European companies and that is going to produce, I think,

26:53.360 --> 27:00.440
in my opinion, the largest ever open source project in Europe. How we protect that if we open it up to

27:00.440 --> 27:07.040
Google, AWS, Microsoft, the technology... I mean the companies for whom this technology is being

27:07.040 --> 27:11.360
designed to neutralize their dominance in the market and prevent them from taking over the

27:11.360 --> 27:22.080
edge computing market as well. That's a practical problem. That's a topic on which we will likely

27:22.080 --> 27:28.480
disagree but that's fine. That's why we have a conversation. I think because from my perspective,

27:28.480 --> 27:40.080
I think that if you talk about IPSI, if you talk about edge computing projects, I think that there

27:40.080 --> 27:52.720
are effectively millions of euros that are spent on helping European companies and that means

27:52.720 --> 28:00.880
companies with headquarters in Europe because I remember I was in such a project and one of the

28:00.880 --> 28:08.760
comments we had when it was rejected is that you cannot get this specific funding because some

28:08.760 --> 28:19.280
partners are not European. That's not a team. That's not just a company with a subsidiary in

28:19.280 --> 28:30.800
Europe. We have the funding mechanism. That's already in place. Next, the question is not how

28:30.800 --> 28:37.760
do we restrict some of the funding to help European companies. The question is how do we make it

28:37.760 --> 28:48.880
effective? I think that we have a fundamental problem in Europe about that. We spend lots of

28:48.880 --> 28:54.480
money and at some point in research projects, I don't know if you have been involved in those

28:54.480 --> 29:00.600
research projects, but in research or innovation projects, we tell people, A, you need to do open

29:00.600 --> 29:07.960
source. Some of them, and I would say 80% of them maybe, understand that they just need to publish

29:07.960 --> 29:17.880
abandonware on GitHub to check the green box. They think, oh, come on. We published in open source.

29:17.880 --> 29:26.000
I think that we also have to do our part and to understand that, yes, when you do open source,

29:26.000 --> 29:35.160
you need to build a community, you need to build a governance, you need to... I imagine, I dream

29:35.160 --> 29:43.640
maybe that a group of European companies, because they identify that a project that has been created

29:43.640 --> 29:53.440
somewhere else is very important for them, takes over, sends enough developers in a meritocratic

29:53.440 --> 30:00.480
environment to take over the governance of the project and to have more commuters, et cetera.

30:00.480 --> 30:11.040
So I think there is... I know in most countries, in most continents, we can see some protectionist

30:11.040 --> 30:21.840
approach and I don't like it. And my organization doesn't like it either. But I think that it's

30:21.840 --> 30:32.120
really exactly... We should exactly do the opposite. That we have the framework to fund some

30:32.120 --> 30:38.760
developments. We have the incentive or we have the requirement to make the development open source.

30:38.760 --> 30:50.400
The problem is that at some point, it is lost in some of fine-grained open source initiatives

30:50.400 --> 30:55.440
that never reach a critical mass. So of course, when I say that, I have an interest, is that,

30:55.440 --> 31:00.400
okay, at the European Foundation, we can help people group together to reach such a critical

31:00.400 --> 31:06.920
mass. But I mean it. I mean that there are plenty of open source foundations, as the Apache

31:06.920 --> 31:13.520
Foundation. We are here in Europe and we are incorporated in Europe, post-it code in Europe.

31:13.520 --> 31:24.080
And I want to see more critical mass of people and companies who group together and have the

31:24.080 --> 31:33.680
ambition not to be reactive, but to really just create the next technology for edge computing,

31:33.680 --> 31:39.080
for example. And the next technology for edge computing, that will be open source. Whether

31:39.080 --> 31:45.160
it's a started bootstrap in Europe or it's bootstrap in the US or it's bootstrap in China,

31:45.160 --> 31:53.960
everybody at some point will converge to a few of those technologies. So we need to do better

31:53.960 --> 32:03.160
when we do open source. I don't say that for you. No, I agree. I mean, there's no discussion about

32:03.160 --> 32:08.760
that. So I can tell you the next big tool for edge cloud in Europe is going to be open source.

32:08.760 --> 32:15.280
So and that's it. And that involves the main industrial actors in the continent. So that's

32:15.280 --> 32:19.960
a fact. We only have, it has to be approved by Digi competition and all that, but that's

32:19.960 --> 32:25.960
minor details. But if that happens and goes well, we'll have a five-year project, five-year long

32:25.960 --> 32:31.120
project developing some first class open source in Europe. And I agree with you. We have to

32:31.120 --> 32:38.640
mobilize, I mean, the whole community beyond the small technology providers and we have to invest

32:38.640 --> 32:43.880
those fundings better and more strategically as well. So as a company, for instance, I would love

32:43.880 --> 32:49.960
if European projects hadn't been a horizon Europe or research and innovation projects hadn't been

32:49.960 --> 32:56.040
spending this money in small pieces of software to contribute to open a stack, for instance,

32:56.040 --> 33:03.000
which is our competitor and not to open Nebula or some other European providers. So the large,

33:03.000 --> 33:07.680
one of the most striking things of the thing with the work we've been doing a couple of years is

33:07.680 --> 33:13.520
bringing the main European open source providers into the European research and innovation

33:13.520 --> 33:19.000
ecosystem because they weren't there. People like SUSE like MariaDB, limited. I mean, these people

33:19.000 --> 33:25.120
have never ever considered even accessing trying to get this funding or contributing to research

33:25.120 --> 33:31.080
and innovation projects in Europe. On the other hand, we find most of the US open source vendors,

33:31.080 --> 33:35.920
but also cloud providers very well in the decision in that area. So that's something we also have to

33:35.920 --> 33:42.160
work on to mobilize all these resources to actually help European open source companies

33:42.160 --> 33:45.800
being more sustainable in the long term and get these contributions more more fluently.

33:45.800 --> 33:53.240
So we have a question over here. Afterwards, I registered a question here, then one over there,

33:53.240 --> 34:02.040
then I saw one over here and I saw one at the front. One request, if you want to ask a question,

34:02.040 --> 34:08.600
please put your hand up and then try to get eye contact with me, then I can acknowledge that I

34:08.600 --> 34:15.160
saw you. It's also a little bit difficult in this large room. So handing over. So what I think is

34:15.160 --> 34:23.120
that like back to maybe this definition part where we have European open source, I feel like the open

34:23.120 --> 34:33.880
source part of that is very much global. So it shouldn't be localized to any area really.

34:33.880 --> 34:42.320
And then we have in Europe, what we should maybe improve on is the like those two aspects,

34:42.320 --> 34:48.720
the using open source software and the creating open source software. And I can't exactly speak

34:48.720 --> 34:55.640
for those major projects, which are like funded by huge companies either in Europe or mostly in

34:55.640 --> 35:02.720
the US right now. But what I see is just a lot of individual projects from individual people who

35:02.720 --> 35:09.320
just contribute to open source, perhaps even their free time or small company or whatever.

35:09.320 --> 35:17.040
And right, but they still are, they are still the backbone of maybe an entire industry without

35:17.040 --> 35:27.520
that industry even realizing. So I feel like this is where we as maybe the European Union or as Europe

35:27.520 --> 35:36.480
in general could dramatically improve on is just to focus on those essential projects. I mean,

35:36.480 --> 35:48.320
there's this, I forgot the name, a German fund for exactly those projects kind of project that

35:48.320 --> 36:00.760
like the base project kind of small, but still really important. Yeah, exactly. Right. So I would

36:00.760 --> 36:08.240
love to see more of these kinds of initiatives. And I think that's really important. Not, I mean,

36:08.240 --> 36:16.400
I don't know if like those government as governance aspects of open source are even that important.

36:16.400 --> 36:22.200
I see it if we are actually the main consumer of something or we have specific goals we want to

36:22.200 --> 36:34.600
realize in open source as Europe, but just I feel like just empowering those individuals or

36:34.600 --> 36:42.560
companies or anyone who's contributing to important open source projects, regardless of if they are

36:42.560 --> 36:55.520
have a government's role or not is really beneficial. Yeah. Well, I like the topic of empowering people.

36:55.520 --> 37:08.280
I think that when we also when we fund open source, we have a topic is that sometimes maybe we don't

37:08.280 --> 37:21.200
have enough money going down to the developers because, you know, I mean, in some of the places

37:21.200 --> 37:28.480
where I hear a lot about open source, open source, open source, open source, sometimes I hardly find

37:28.480 --> 37:37.480
the developers. And that's so that's we have the problem on the two sides of the spectrum. I mean,

37:37.480 --> 37:47.160
we have under policy aspect, we have policy people who are talking about open source and that's fine.

37:47.160 --> 37:54.840
I think that we need to potentially do better to characterize what we mean by open source and to

37:54.840 --> 38:02.160
make it better consumable by the policy people. And on the other side, we have also, I think the

38:02.160 --> 38:12.840
romantic view of open source being done by individuals, like what you describe, I think that

38:12.840 --> 38:18.760
we have especially here at first day, okay, we have all the individuals coming for the weekend,

38:18.760 --> 38:26.080
etc, all the volunteers, but I think that even in the room, we have also lots of people who are

38:26.080 --> 38:34.560
doing open source for their day job. So that's, I think that I understand the individual aspect.

38:34.560 --> 38:42.240
I think that there are also lots of projects that are not really supported by individuals,

38:42.240 --> 38:49.840
but by some kind of organizations that requires those projects. And I think that after her bleed

38:49.840 --> 38:58.840
and workforce share, etc, things that to some extent, the industry is embracing the topic and

38:58.840 --> 39:10.120
trying to, how do you call it, do better and potentially hire those individuals and contract

39:10.120 --> 39:20.960
your basis, etc, to take care of it. I mean, that's something, you know, any of you attended

39:20.960 --> 39:28.320
the open forum Europe summit yesterday, but it was an interesting, if you can go, recommend if

39:28.320 --> 39:40.000
you look at the talk by the CEO of GitHub, right? It's very interesting. He was arguing

39:40.000 --> 39:46.240
about the AI act and how open source would be left outside the scope of the AI act because of the

39:46.240 --> 39:52.240
nature of open source being run mainly by individuals. But then the contrast is when

39:52.240 --> 39:57.360
you go to argue against the cyber resilience act, then the argument changes and it says,

39:57.360 --> 40:03.600
look, I mean, we are companies, every open source is at some point commercial. So I think we have

40:03.600 --> 40:12.240
to again discuss within, especially in Europe as well, how we explain what we do, how we explain

40:12.240 --> 40:16.360
what the community is and it changes from different parts of the, I mean, if you look at the technology

40:16.360 --> 40:20.520
stack and different projects, I mean, some projects are run by volunteers, some projects are run entirely

40:20.520 --> 40:24.880
by the communities, some of the projects are run by companies alone. I mean, our project, we run it

40:24.880 --> 40:29.360
alone. I mean, we control the roadmap, we control the releases and you can, you're free to contribute

40:29.360 --> 40:34.280
with the site, we accept that or not. And that's it. Other projects, they have a different governance.

40:34.280 --> 40:40.480
It's a community of companies and they somehow benefit from that shirt and that shirt knowledge

40:40.480 --> 40:45.680
and that's perfectly fine. They collaboration among competitors and that's perfectly okay. I mean,

40:45.680 --> 40:52.520
there are different models and I think they are all okay, but each of them have their own particularities.

40:52.520 --> 40:57.960
So this concept of sovereignty in Europe, I think it's especially relevant for those

40:57.960 --> 41:05.160
projects in which they are mainly maintained and controlled by companies, by open source companies

41:05.160 --> 41:12.320
or other companies. So that's just to frame a bit the discussion, I mean, from my perspective.

41:12.320 --> 41:17.960
So those are the kind of projects that for me personally and for others create some concern in

41:17.960 --> 41:22.240
terms of if we develop these projects in Europe and we have this ambition of having the European

41:22.240 --> 41:26.640
industry heavily involved in maintaining these projects, how we protect these technologies in

41:26.640 --> 41:34.080
these communities from the very same companies we are creating this technology, not against,

41:34.080 --> 41:47.240
but you understand me, right? I would like to come back to the European project and I think

41:47.240 --> 41:55.480
it's really important. We want to be democratic. It means freedom and seeing what's happening right

41:55.480 --> 42:02.600
now in the world, it's like, woohoo! So democracy and sustainability, I think it's part of the

42:02.600 --> 42:10.600
European project and so how can we be leaders in and I prefer free software because free is in

42:10.600 --> 42:19.120
freedom not as in free beer. How can we use that for interoperability that leads to right to

42:19.120 --> 42:26.360
repair and that helps sustainability in the long run. So how can we put open source European software

42:26.360 --> 42:33.920
to help build the European way of doing stuff, if I can say it like that. And I think that the

42:33.920 --> 42:43.760
adversary of European open source software is international closed software more than international

42:43.760 --> 42:52.680
open source software. I don't know. When I see that all the better universities are sold to Microsoft,

42:52.680 --> 43:03.480
we have a problem. And how can we change that using European companies that are using open

43:03.480 --> 43:16.640
source software? Yeah, I mean, that's a couple of big questions. I think as we see this debate

43:16.640 --> 43:26.840
taking place, I think at certain parts of the technological world, let's say, part of this

43:26.840 --> 43:34.280
stack, we are happily beyond the debate between open source or proprietary source. I mean, that's

43:34.280 --> 43:44.600
something I understand in some other areas is not that clear. I mean, it's a daily sale. You have to

43:44.600 --> 43:52.440
fight a lot with users and other companies to trust open source. In some parts, in some areas,

43:52.440 --> 44:00.720
that's I think we are we are beyond that. So I'll tell you a very, very small anecdote. We have the

44:00.720 --> 44:06.680
General Assembly of the industrial, what's the name? European Alliance for Industrial Data,

44:06.680 --> 44:13.040
Edge and Cloud in December, for instance. It's only for it's a it's a it's a body of it's an

44:13.040 --> 44:18.280
alliance, industry alliance set by the Commission or supported by the Commission led by the industry

44:18.280 --> 44:23.760
only for European companies. Okay, we we are defining the roadmap, the technological roadmap

44:23.760 --> 44:29.280
for for the cloud and the edge and edge. A bit of such promotion happened out of talk at five in

44:29.280 --> 44:33.960
the sovereign cloud that room about the specifics of this initiative. So we are defining the

44:33.960 --> 44:38.560
technological priorities that we need the Commission to help us co fund in the next year

44:38.560 --> 44:45.440
of around edge cloud and data only for Europeans and when we have this this General Assembly here

44:45.440 --> 44:51.840
in Brussels in December. There are three working groups, the cloud and its working group, the one

44:51.840 --> 44:57.160
for member states, members from different governments. And there's there's an specific

44:57.160 --> 45:05.120
working group for for the fence and aeronautic sector. And for me personally, I'm old enough to

45:05.120 --> 45:12.520
have seen some changes in the sector. For me, watching at this five representatives across Europe

45:12.520 --> 45:23.720
from the main defense companies saying they they understand I mean, they want to use open source,

45:23.720 --> 45:32.560
they do want to use open source, they just need help to use open source, but they want that was

45:32.560 --> 45:38.200
that was surprising for me. Okay, it's it's the defense sector. Okay. But you know, I mean, this

45:38.200 --> 45:43.600
is people with a very specific mindset and very critical projects and very, very hard requirements

45:43.600 --> 45:47.880
on the contracts they get all that stuff. They were saying we want to we want to use open source,

45:47.880 --> 45:53.200
we just need to see how to actually put it under the requirements we have in this in the sector,

45:53.200 --> 45:57.480
because because that's what we want to do. And they want to contribute to these projects,

45:57.480 --> 46:02.560
they we just need to tell them how exactly with their peculiarities and their particularities. But

46:02.560 --> 46:09.200
in some areas, we're happily beyond that discussion. And we are I think mature, I mean, the market in

46:09.200 --> 46:15.080
that area, so the sector is mature enough to get into the nuances of what do we mean by open source,

46:15.080 --> 46:20.480
who's controlling open these open source, who's developing this, what are the risks of taking

46:20.480 --> 46:26.280
assuming or using this technology or that other technology? I mean, obviously, I have to confess

46:26.280 --> 46:31.760
that that's a debate is a small open source European company, this is an environment that benefits the

46:31.760 --> 46:38.880
small company like us and others, because it helps us differentiate from others. But that's what it

46:38.880 --> 46:44.200
is. I mean, we have the European open source sector, you know what it is. I mean, we have a few larger

46:44.200 --> 46:48.640
companies, but most of us are smaller, even if we have been for years, producing very good

46:48.640 --> 46:55.000
technologies, I think. But that's that's what it is. So the question. So we have one last question.

46:55.000 --> 47:00.840
Yeah, I saw many others registered this. But we can't take any further questions after this one.

47:00.840 --> 47:06.240
So I'm very sorry about those who gave their sign to me. And we can't take your question.

47:06.240 --> 47:12.600
Thank you. It's not so much a question anymore, given the time, but I think given what's on the

47:12.600 --> 47:17.760
slide right now, as you've been open source, I think you talk a lot about governance of it. I

47:17.760 --> 47:23.320
think it's about dependence on external actors, which are not a year, but I think we want to be

47:23.320 --> 47:33.080
self sovereign, as it's now the type. But I think we should have expertise in it. It doesn't

47:33.080 --> 47:38.200
necessarily need to be European development. We need European expertise to judge it. And if

47:38.200 --> 47:43.000
somebody decides to stop that, we can take over. It's not so much that we created in the first

47:43.000 --> 47:48.600
place, but we need to build the expertise not only in development, but also in knowledge about using

47:48.600 --> 47:57.160
it, promoting it. I think that's one of the things we just lack education. Exactly. We need more

47:57.160 --> 48:01.880
education on both development and promotion of open source and using it. I think that's the thing.

48:01.880 --> 48:09.640
We need European education on this. I think we agree on that. And in order to see my, when I

48:09.640 --> 48:19.240
put that sentence, and again, I'm French that maybe incorrect English, but my goal was that to

48:19.240 --> 48:30.840
bring us to quickly conclude that the short answer is no. But I think that we must have a European

48:30.840 --> 48:37.960
industry, our industrial strategy for open source. And I think that we at least can agree on that.

48:38.680 --> 48:48.200
And we have lots of talks about open source in the European setup. And it was mentioned in one

48:48.200 --> 48:59.240
of the questions with the CRA. And I think that, okay, on one side, for me, that's really interesting

48:59.240 --> 49:09.960
to see that the cyber residence act mentions open source as an exception. But the way it mentions

49:09.960 --> 49:17.320
open source as an exception is something that is almost not acceptable for lots of people in open

49:17.320 --> 49:25.080
source, because that creates lots of concerns. And so on one side, we have incentives, lots of

49:25.080 --> 49:32.200
incentives to do more open source in Europe. And on the other side, we are creating regulations that

49:32.200 --> 49:40.680
could break the way to redistribute software. So that would really be a problem. And that was

49:40.680 --> 49:45.880
my conclusion. So your conclusion, and we are done. My conclusion is that the time's up.

49:45.880 --> 49:53.880
Thank you, everyone.
