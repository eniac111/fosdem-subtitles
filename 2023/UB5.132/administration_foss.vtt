WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
Happy to introduce our next speaker, Klaus Wieckenhott.

00:09.560 --> 00:19.360
Yeah, thank you and welcome to my talk.

00:19.360 --> 00:24.600
Actually today I'm here representing the Open Source Business Alliance, so the OSPR.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.920
We are a non-profit organization representing more than 200 companies in Germany trying

00:30.920 --> 00:37.400
to make money with open source software and also the goal of the OSPR is to promote usage

00:37.400 --> 00:39.200
of open source software.

00:39.200 --> 00:44.360
So we have some heavyweight members like Susie, Red Hat or Telecom but also smaller companies

00:44.360 --> 00:47.600
like Linu Data whom I'm working for.

00:47.600 --> 00:53.880
And within the OSPR we have several working groups and I'm the spokesman of the working

00:53.880 --> 00:57.080
group Berschaftung that means procurement.

00:57.080 --> 01:03.440
And so we are busy or we were busy the last year with negotiations with people working

01:03.440 --> 01:08.680
on this sector and I want to share a bit all the experiences, all the insights I found

01:08.680 --> 01:16.280
personally because I think it's very interesting to see the other side of the table when we're

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
talking with people about that.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.440
I have said in disclaimer, so this is no legal advice.

01:21.440 --> 01:27.640
I have an engineers degree, I'm more kind of a developer and I just came a bit by accident

01:27.640 --> 01:30.520
into this world.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.720
So this is no legal advice.

01:32.720 --> 01:40.460
If you have legal issues, especially license issues, you need to go and get a lawyer.

01:40.460 --> 01:51.260
So why is all this getting more important on part of the public sector side?

01:51.260 --> 01:56.200
So we know that the world is changing sometimes in different ways we don't expect.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.880
I remember the last Fostem before Corona and then just a few weeks later the streets were

02:01.880 --> 02:04.320
empty because there was the lockdown.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.840
Then we had a Fostem completely virtually.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.920
That was very strange because you were sitting relaxed with coffee and everything at home

02:10.920 --> 02:14.600
but you're missing the atmosphere, people aren't there.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.760
We had Ever Given got stuck in the Suez channel so we are running out of supplies with IT

02:19.760 --> 02:21.640
hardware and all these things.

02:21.640 --> 02:26.120
Now we have a war on the eastern part of Europe and it all leads to something that we call

02:26.120 --> 02:31.560
sovereignty, especially digital sovereignty and this is something that the countries really

02:31.560 --> 02:38.540
now understand themselves so they see that they have to be able to react on things and

02:38.540 --> 02:42.240
that to handle on their own will.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.840
So in the actual coalition agreement from the German federal government, there's something

02:45.840 --> 02:48.860
stated, it's in German but I translated it for you.

02:48.860 --> 02:52.440
So developments are usually commissioned as open source and the corresponding software

02:52.440 --> 02:54.640
is generally made public.

02:54.640 --> 03:00.560
And there are many more initiatives in German counties and cities that are focusing on building

03:00.560 --> 03:02.400
on open source technology.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.320
I'm pretty sure it's the same all over Europe.

03:04.320 --> 03:09.320
We have a context to France, to Luxembourg where all these things also happen in a similar

03:09.320 --> 03:12.640
way.

03:12.640 --> 03:20.120
So far so good, it's quite hard to get an understanding on how the number of used open

03:20.120 --> 03:21.960
source software evolves.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.680
So the main principle in our open source software is that we share it with everybody.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.280
So I cannot check somewhere how many installations there are.

03:30.280 --> 03:34.440
You can sometimes figure out in server logs what kind of clients are connecting.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.560
You can check download numbers from GitHub, GitLab and whatever but you don't see a real

03:38.560 --> 03:41.600
number.

03:41.600 --> 03:48.400
So at OSPR we didn't survive on our member companies dealing with selling open source

03:48.400 --> 03:54.640
to the public sector and asking a bit about the issues they face and the question that

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
arrived.

03:55.640 --> 03:59.920
And we also did monthly workshops with the minister in Germany that's responsible for

03:59.920 --> 04:01.840
some of these contracts.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.920
And then we got some pretty interesting insight about the issues they have.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.000
And the result is the open source licenses we use and the contract management on the

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
public sector side.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.040
They are not really friends.

04:14.040 --> 04:19.000
So there are some problems that we need to solve, that we need to address and there's

04:19.000 --> 04:20.560
really room for improvement.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.040
And I want to point out some of these things here.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.080
So the power of open source is something that I don't have to explain to you.

04:27.080 --> 04:34.100
These are the four freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation stated in the GPL.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.360
We all know that probably by heart.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.700
And this is the base of all our work, let's say.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.740
But this power of open source, they come with a price tag.

04:45.740 --> 04:52.340
And this is something I didn't know before I was really looking into these issues.

04:52.340 --> 04:59.680
Because you get all these freedoms for the, if you apply to the terms and conditions.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.480
And I took it here from the GPL to O. You may copy and redistribute verbatim copies

05:04.480 --> 05:07.320
of the program's source code as you receive it.

05:07.320 --> 05:13.760
And any medium provided that you conspiciously and appropriately publish on each copy an

05:13.760 --> 05:16.880
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer warranty.

05:16.880 --> 05:22.960
Keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty.

05:22.960 --> 05:30.040
And give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program.

05:30.040 --> 05:35.540
These terms and conditions mainly apply in the case of distribution of software.

05:35.540 --> 05:39.360
So this is something that is not very common in a business to business situation.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.600
So if the company is buying software, they just want to keep it for themselves.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.460
They're producing cars or they are bakeries.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.900
So then they're not going to distribute the software.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.620
So there is no problem.

05:51.620 --> 05:56.140
But if you go business to government, you most often have the situation that the government

05:56.140 --> 06:01.240
itself is a huge complex body of several legal entities.

06:01.240 --> 06:05.760
And then one entity is getting, is organizing the software.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.720
And then they have to distribute it to the other parts.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.960
And then this distribution fact applies here.

06:11.960 --> 06:16.520
And then they have to check if they apply on the licenses.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.120
And they have to check that everything is complete and everything of these conditions

06:21.120 --> 06:22.400
are fulfilled.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.700
So these are legal issues.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.700
So they need lawyers to work on that.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.880
And this costs money, resources.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.840
Another thing that we face is that these licenses we are using are mainly in English available.

06:33.840 --> 06:38.960
So there's only an English version, which is quite hard in Germany because you need

06:38.960 --> 06:41.440
a translation into proper German.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.080
But there is no authorized version of the GPL, for example.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.960
And they are all based on US conception of law.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.680
So for example, this copyright thing we have in Germany is completely different in the

06:52.680 --> 06:53.740
US.

06:53.740 --> 06:58.440
So you need lawyers to put that into the right thing.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.480
I'm not going to say they are not working.

07:00.480 --> 07:06.120
So we have several projects like GPLviolation.org.

07:06.120 --> 07:11.400
They showed in Germany by going to court that the licenses work and people understand them.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.080
But it's quite hard to use them.

07:16.080 --> 07:22.080
So in Germany, mainly the software is ordered via tenders.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.320
This is regulated in a procurement law.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.240
And there is something like the E4BIT.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.320
That means the against in the E4BIT.

07:28.320 --> 07:47.120
So B

07:47.120 --> 07:57.180
is

07:57.180 --> 08:03.680
in

08:03.680 --> 08:07.000
negotiation necessary to solve these issues.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.460
And this is also some extra work,

08:09.460 --> 08:12.720
something of the price tag I was talking about.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.040
You're here in Belgium,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.260
and Belgium is famous for its comic strips,

08:19.260 --> 08:22.400
so I found this one that I really, really like.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.080
It shows a modern application, any application,

08:25.080 --> 08:27.800
probably one of the app store from the talk before.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.980
And you see it's very shiny, complex,

08:29.980 --> 08:32.260
and very detailed model,

08:32.260 --> 08:33.760
but it's a kind of a building blocks.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.940
This is the way we work.

08:34.940 --> 08:39.020
So we use open source blocks somewhere outside,

08:39.020 --> 08:41.220
and we recombine them to something new.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.360
And the thing is,

08:44.360 --> 08:47.900
each of these components has its own license.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.880
And the problem here is that we cannot say

08:53.880 --> 08:57.400
there is a final license for our whole product,

08:57.400 --> 08:59.320
because when we distribute the software,

08:59.320 --> 09:02.440
we distribute all the small packages together.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.160
And at OSB-ABI also did an examination

09:05.160 --> 09:07.720
of a popular video chat solution,

09:07.720 --> 09:09.960
the beginning of COVID, we all needed that.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.980
I'm not gonna name it, but on the project side,

09:13.980 --> 09:16.120
it says it used the LGPL,

09:16.120 --> 09:19.160
so the GNU Lesson public license.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.000
And when you install that on your hard disk,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.640
and you try to examine all the files installed there,

09:23.640 --> 09:25.960
and figure out all the different license files

09:25.960 --> 09:27.400
that we're putting on your hard disk,

09:27.400 --> 09:29.560
you find that it's not LGPL,

09:29.560 --> 09:32.840
it's a mixture of different things.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.640
And this tools also the installer

09:34.640 --> 09:36.520
downloads fonts from Microsoft.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.380
So they have some specific true type fonts.

09:40.380 --> 09:44.720
And in Debian, you can download an installer for those,

09:44.720 --> 09:46.040
then you call the installer,

09:46.040 --> 09:48.880
and then you have to apply to the Euler from Microsoft,

09:48.880 --> 09:50.520
and then the download starts.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.480
But here nothing happened,

09:51.480 --> 09:53.820
it just appear on your hard disk.

09:53.820 --> 09:56.220
So this is something that you have take care,

09:56.220 --> 09:59.460
when dealing with this software.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.940
And this is something,

10:00.940 --> 10:02.420
when we think back to the public sector,

10:02.420 --> 10:05.160
they distributed to another legal entity within.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.300
So now they have to fulfill all these license things

10:08.300 --> 10:10.340
that are putting in that product.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.100
The main question I cannot answer here is,

10:14.100 --> 10:16.020
who is responsible for that?

10:16.020 --> 10:18.980
The project that put the installer on their project page,

10:18.980 --> 10:22.980
the programmer or the developer that made that installer,

10:22.980 --> 10:25.380
probably the company that made the offer,

10:25.380 --> 10:26.980
and made the installation work,

10:26.980 --> 10:31.020
or the admin guy on host server it's running,

10:31.020 --> 10:33.060
or at least later the final entity

10:33.060 --> 10:35.500
that is using this application.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.280
So this is a kind of an issue.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.820
And be sure with containers, the things are getting worse,

10:39.820 --> 10:41.580
because then you get a bunch of containers,

10:41.580 --> 10:43.500
everything with his own operating system,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.340
and also a different bunch of software,

10:45.340 --> 10:47.780
and a different bunch of licenses integrated.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.100
So we need to answer the question,

10:52.100 --> 10:54.900
when we look on a piece of software, what is inside?

10:54.900 --> 10:58.700
Which licenses are used inside?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.820
And then we come to something like a package insert,

11:00.820 --> 11:05.620
like for medicine, and the only way to deal with that

11:05.620 --> 11:08.700
is an S-bomb, the software bill of materials.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.980
And this should list all the components,

11:10.980 --> 11:13.380
all libraries, all modules, all container stuff,

11:13.380 --> 11:16.060
everything that's put into your product.

11:16.060 --> 11:20.420
And for the S-bomb, we need the information about,

11:20.420 --> 11:23.060
yeah, the piece of program, the source,

11:23.060 --> 11:24.740
where does it come from?

11:24.740 --> 11:27.180
The version and the license.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.740
With the version and the source,

11:30.740 --> 11:33.340
we can also answer security questions,

11:33.340 --> 11:35.620
like are we vulnerable for something?

11:35.620 --> 11:39.340
Lock4j, for example, is somewhere Lock4j implemented,

11:39.340 --> 11:41.660
which version do we have to fix that?

11:41.660 --> 11:43.940
And for us, for our legal view on that,

11:43.940 --> 11:47.700
we know which licenses are there.

11:47.700 --> 11:51.100
But when we have this bunch of licenses,

11:51.100 --> 11:54.360
we are not really done as public sector,

11:54.360 --> 11:57.100
because now we have to check for our business case.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.300
Are all these license compatible?

12:00.300 --> 12:01.460
Are they working together?

12:01.460 --> 12:04.620
We have something like copy left that might have an impact.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.500
So we have to figure out that situation

12:06.500 --> 12:08.220
for a specific business case.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.260
So we still need some people

12:10.260 --> 12:13.260
dealing with license compliance stuff.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.220
For the S-bomb itself,

12:14.220 --> 12:16.620
there are different formats available outside.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.980
The one that's mainly seems to be the most common use

12:21.980 --> 12:26.420
so far is the SPDX format, Software Package Data Exchange.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.980
It's maintained by the Linux Foundation,

12:28.980 --> 12:32.140
and it's the only one that is an ISO certification now.

12:32.140 --> 12:34.500
So this is something that's an ISO standard,

12:34.500 --> 12:37.220
and then we can use that.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.500
There are tools available out there

12:38.500 --> 12:42.220
to convert S-bomb from one format to another.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.300
That's mainly text files in different formats,

12:44.300 --> 12:46.020
JSON, for example.

12:46.020 --> 12:51.020
And yeah, with that, we get a detailed view

12:51.020 --> 12:56.020
on all the components that's inside our software delivery.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.940
And for people who are being interested

12:57.940 --> 13:00.380
or being a bit afraid,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.880
oh, I have to deliver an S-bomb.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.060
Tomorrow there's a whole death room here on Fosten,

13:06.060 --> 13:09.900
just dealing with this S-bomb topic.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.060
So this is something we will probably face in future

13:13.060 --> 13:15.820
when we apply for software tenders

13:15.820 --> 13:20.820
that we have to deliver an S-bomb with our solution.

13:21.780 --> 13:23.540
When we check all those licenses

13:23.540 --> 13:26.140
that may be around in the world,

13:26.140 --> 13:29.740
we come to a number of probably 1,800 different licenses

13:29.740 --> 13:31.540
that may appear in such an S-bomb.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.860
So we have 1,800 different legal texts

13:34.860 --> 13:37.380
that we might have to examine.

13:38.460 --> 13:43.220
Ozi has certified 116 of these as being open source.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.460
From my personal point of view, this list is incomplete.

13:46.460 --> 13:50.860
So Ozi has set up a kind of a lifecycle thing

13:50.860 --> 13:55.860
to get rid of licenses that are not common anymore.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.700
So to narrow down this number,

13:59.700 --> 14:03.260
so there are probably 500 that may be something

14:03.260 --> 14:05.220
like we would accept as open source.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.560
And each of them are different.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.660
So when you're working as a lawyer

14:13.660 --> 14:15.540
and you have to check the license situation,

14:15.540 --> 14:18.180
you have to deal with these number of licenses.

14:18.180 --> 14:20.060
But I want to remember you that also

14:20.060 --> 14:25.060
the proprietary software uses licenses and OILAs

14:25.940 --> 14:28.860
and they are mainly much more complex

14:28.860 --> 14:30.920
than our open source licenses.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.540
They are sometimes specific for a specific product

14:34.540 --> 14:35.940
and they are changed regularly.

14:35.940 --> 14:39.100
So if you use any device, sometimes it pops up,

14:39.100 --> 14:41.020
and you OILA, you have to accept it.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.260
And I'm pretty sure everybody here in the room

14:43.260 --> 14:46.100
checks them carefully, find out the differences

14:46.100 --> 14:48.740
to the last version because they are not kind of red

14:48.740 --> 14:52.160
or blue marked, and accept them afterwards.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.680
With open source, we have the real advantage,

14:55.680 --> 14:58.140
the unknown or hidden advantage I called it.

14:58.140 --> 15:01.500
We have the real advantage that our licenses are quite short.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.380
So they are mainly just a couple of pages,

15:04.380 --> 15:08.860
sometimes even not that, I think MIT is something

15:08.860 --> 15:11.620
like just a few lines of license code.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.980
And most of them follow a specific pattern.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.420
So they are derived from each other.

15:17.420 --> 15:20.260
And so you can find a structure inside

15:20.260 --> 15:25.060
and you get a better feeling for what this license is about.

15:25.060 --> 15:26.640
And they are pretty static.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.940
I mentioned the GPL2.0 before,

15:29.940 --> 15:33.060
that's the license applied onto the Linux kernel.

15:33.060 --> 15:37.460
And the GPL2.0 is unchanged since June 1991.

15:37.460 --> 15:42.220
So more than 30 years, the same license text.

15:42.220 --> 15:45.060
If I'm working as a lawyer, I'm pretty fine.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.940
I spend one time all my work in that license.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.420
And then the next 30 years,

15:49.420 --> 15:54.020
I can work with my customers and support them.

15:57.660 --> 16:01.220
What you also have seen while talking with people

16:01.220 --> 16:03.640
in the public sector that there are some kind of

16:03.640 --> 16:06.540
misconceptions outside.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.140
So this is a kind of misunderstandings

16:09.140 --> 16:12.400
that probably people talk, told them.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.660
And the first one is there is some people think

16:15.660 --> 16:18.660
there's an obligation to publish everything on the internet.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.820
But this is not written in any license.

16:21.820 --> 16:25.020
The idea of open source is you give somebody

16:25.020 --> 16:27.260
binary piece of software,

16:27.260 --> 16:29.060
and then you have to give him the source code

16:29.060 --> 16:30.320
of that software.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.580
So if something in the recipient environment changes,

16:34.580 --> 16:37.980
he can adapt the software on his needs.

16:37.980 --> 16:41.380
He can add new device drivers, he can change the language,

16:41.380 --> 16:43.480
he can add new functionality, whatever.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.260
But the thing is, you have to hand over the source code

16:47.260 --> 16:50.340
with appropriate rights to work on the source code

16:50.340 --> 16:52.660
to the recipient of a software.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.100
Not to anybody somewhere in the world.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.820
This is something most of us do

16:56.820 --> 16:58.500
because we want to spread our idea,

16:58.500 --> 17:03.100
we want to spread our software, but we don't have to.

17:03.100 --> 17:06.220
This is something important when you go on this,

17:06.220 --> 17:09.300
I think we have another talk today in the military sector,

17:09.300 --> 17:11.980
where probably parts of the solution must be hidden

17:11.980 --> 17:15.220
or must be not being published.

17:15.220 --> 17:17.940
Then you can easily use open source, you can adapt it,

17:17.940 --> 17:20.200
you can give it to another legal entity,

17:20.200 --> 17:22.740
but only they have to receive the source code.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.860
You don't have to put a mission control system

17:24.860 --> 17:25.740
on the internet.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.260
But some people are thinking like, this is open source,

17:29.260 --> 17:31.140
I have to publish everything.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.860
Another thing is like pushing changes back

17:32.860 --> 17:33.740
to the community.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.300
I personally really like that idea

17:35.300 --> 17:38.380
because then I'm not in charge anymore for my changes

17:38.380 --> 17:40.260
because the community does.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.380
Otherwise, with every updated version,

17:42.380 --> 17:44.700
I have to apply my changes again.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.780
But in fact, it's not stated in any license.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.540
It's more like common sense that we do so,

17:49.540 --> 17:51.540
but we don't have to bring the changes back

17:51.540 --> 17:52.380
to the community.

17:52.380 --> 17:55.020
This is something like mission control system,

17:55.020 --> 17:57.860
missile control system, whatever, we don't have to.

17:59.020 --> 18:01.540
And then we have, especially with copy left,

18:01.540 --> 18:05.700
sometimes the idea of the disclosure of all our source code.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.700
I think it's based in some Microsoft advertisements

18:08.700 --> 18:11.540
from 20 years ago during this Halloween papers,

18:11.540 --> 18:14.740
like all GPL, this kind of cancer.

18:14.740 --> 18:16.180
Distill is in their heads.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.660
No, we don't have to disclose all our source code.

18:19.660 --> 18:23.900
If we accidentally mix GPL into our product,

18:25.180 --> 18:27.460
we break the license.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.080
So we are not licensed anymore.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.400
So we cannot ship that solution.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.840
That's a legal problem we have to solve.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.080
But this is not that we, in this moment,

18:37.080 --> 18:39.200
we have to ship all our source code.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.160
So these are things that we hear.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.780
And then you'll think like, oh shit,

18:44.780 --> 18:47.660
we have to explain them that this is not the case.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.760
It's just normal software that we are dealing with.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.260
And then finally, my last slide,

18:56.260 --> 19:00.700
how can a developer improve the situation?

19:00.700 --> 19:03.420
So I said I'm also more a developer guide

19:03.420 --> 19:05.180
and an illegal guide.

19:05.180 --> 19:08.260
What we can do is when we start writing code,

19:08.260 --> 19:10.180
I mean, I wrote already better before,

19:10.180 --> 19:13.100
but normally you start just coding.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.780
When you start working on a new project,

19:16.780 --> 19:20.060
you should check the licenses of all the components

19:20.060 --> 19:22.540
you wanna use for compatibility.

19:22.540 --> 19:23.700
Do we have copy left?

19:23.700 --> 19:26.620
Does that all work and fit together what we are doing?

19:26.620 --> 19:28.260
And also in the planned business case

19:28.260 --> 19:30.220
that the company I'm working for,

19:30.220 --> 19:35.220
or the client I'm working for is going to use.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.180
Especially for standard components,

19:37.180 --> 19:39.140
when you think of that picture I showed you before,

19:39.140 --> 19:43.980
this strip thing, there was one small block

19:43.980 --> 19:44.980
on the right-hand side.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.940
If this breaks, it all falls apart.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.300
And this seems to be a very fundamental piece

19:51.300 --> 19:53.980
of that solution.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.700
So it's probably not that easy to change.

19:59.020 --> 20:02.620
We should think of, we shouldn't think.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.220
We should start building S-bombs

20:04.220 --> 20:07.460
so to check what's inside in our product.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.840
That's also something that the security guys are asking.

20:11.820 --> 20:13.780
And in the US there is something like

20:13.780 --> 20:18.220
the supply chain thing.

20:18.220 --> 20:22.140
There was a presidential advice

20:22.140 --> 20:24.500
on how to secure the digital supply chain.

20:24.500 --> 20:28.020
And S-bomb is a very, very important part in that.

20:28.020 --> 20:33.020
So I personally assume that we have to deliver S-bombs

20:33.660 --> 20:35.540
in public sector projects,

20:35.540 --> 20:38.780
and that developers are starting building S-bombs.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.180
And when you think of that picture I showed you,

20:41.180 --> 20:44.860
when every community of these building blocks

20:44.860 --> 20:47.020
made an S-bomb for their product,

20:47.020 --> 20:49.660
we can iteratively use all these S-bombs

20:49.660 --> 20:51.540
together for the final product.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.540
So this is something that will probably start to work

20:54.540 --> 20:57.640
from automatically, I think.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.580
But you should for your own project start writing S-bombs.

21:00.580 --> 21:03.420
And the best way is to build that into your build process

21:03.420 --> 21:05.900
so that it's created automatically.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.300
And update it with every update that you ship

21:08.300 --> 21:10.900
so that you always have a fresh S-bomb.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.900
I told you there is the license,

21:12.900 --> 21:15.140
the software version included.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.300
So you have to use that for dealing with security issues.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.400
Avoid exotic licenses.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.620
There are some interesting licenses around,

21:25.620 --> 21:28.240
for example, like the beer license.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.060
It's probably not a very good idea

21:30.060 --> 21:34.980
to try to find a very exotic license that nobody else uses

21:34.980 --> 21:37.580
because it makes the work for the lawyers

21:37.580 --> 21:39.700
much more complicated.

21:39.700 --> 21:43.220
And at the end, when you apply for such a tender,

21:43.220 --> 21:45.340
then it's not a specific solution

21:45.340 --> 21:46.900
that must be built in open source,

21:46.900 --> 21:50.460
but it's a tender for any software solution.

21:50.460 --> 21:56.700
And you are just one person offering an open source

21:56.700 --> 21:59.220
solution against proprietary solutions.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.340
They have to check what kind of work do we have afterwards.

22:02.340 --> 22:03.740
Does it fulfill our needs?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.300
And then they make a choice.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.620
And when your thing is way too complex

22:07.620 --> 22:10.460
and they are mainly working lawyers on that level,

22:10.460 --> 22:13.820
then probably they choose something else.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.820
I put in brackets, avoid if possible,

22:16.820 --> 22:19.020
try to reduce the pile of different use license.

22:19.020 --> 22:22.660
I know this is very hard because you cannot change

22:22.660 --> 22:25.180
the licenses of all the pieces that you need.

22:25.180 --> 22:28.580
But going back to OSE, I said they treat 116

22:28.580 --> 22:29.760
as open source licenses.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.500
They already started to narrow down their number of licenses

22:32.500 --> 22:33.940
they put on their website.

22:33.940 --> 22:36.460
And on their website, they have, I think, five popular licenses

22:36.460 --> 22:37.740
that they recommend.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.660
So this is something that you can probably

22:39.660 --> 22:42.260
try to follow.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.820
And the last thing is a question to you.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.460
Do you know the EUPL?

22:46.460 --> 22:49.300
That's the European Union Public License.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.260
It's a copy left license.

22:51.260 --> 22:53.660
And the cool thing on that is it's

22:53.660 --> 22:57.380
available in every European language natively.

22:57.380 --> 23:02.140
So in Germany, we can pick the German version of the UPL

23:02.140 --> 23:03.460
and use that for licensing.

23:03.460 --> 23:04.700
And then we have a German text.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.980
And if you go to German court, we have then German license text.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.340
In Italy, it's the same as an Italian version, a French

23:10.340 --> 23:10.980
version.

23:10.980 --> 23:16.820
And they are all comparable.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.220
Thank you.

23:18.220 --> 23:39.940
I think we can take one or two questions.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.020
Hi, thank you.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.780
I really appreciate that you've identified

23:43.780 --> 23:48.460
a problem in software procurement with the public sector.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.460
And I see that you're making really useful suggestions.

23:51.460 --> 23:56.140
My question is, is the demand from the public sector

23:56.140 --> 23:57.820
to do these things?

23:57.820 --> 24:01.020
Or are you proactively making these suggestions?

24:01.020 --> 24:03.180
Does the public sector understand

24:03.180 --> 24:06.460
that these are challenges in procurement?

24:06.460 --> 24:09.060
Or what is the situation from the other side?

24:09.060 --> 24:11.380
Thank you.

24:11.380 --> 24:16.420
So does the public sector understand the demand

24:16.420 --> 24:17.780
for open source stuff like that?

24:17.780 --> 24:22.740
So it depends a bit to whom you are talking.

24:22.740 --> 24:26.860
As I said in this coalition contract, on very top level,

24:26.860 --> 24:29.060
they say we want to do open source.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.220
And then it goes down.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.980
And then you think like, then there

24:31.980 --> 24:33.980
are people that probably got the order.

24:33.980 --> 24:36.740
We have to order open source stuff.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.180
What is that?

24:38.180 --> 24:40.100
And then they probably make a tender.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.020
And sometimes you have a complete new thing

24:42.020 --> 24:42.900
that should be built.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.460
Then they just probably put the tag open source,

24:46.460 --> 24:48.500
or it has to be open source on that.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.380
And if they just go for any software,

24:50.380 --> 24:55.420
like a video chat solution, then they should be open.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.700
And then it depends on the person

24:57.700 --> 25:00.460
if they know what open source is and if they know it

25:00.460 --> 25:10.820
the right way.
