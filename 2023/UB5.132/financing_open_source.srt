0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:01.000
Dr. Rodjinska.

2
0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:24.840
Raise your hand if you think that open source projects have too much money.

3
0:00:24.840 --> 0:00:29.920
I hope that there will be someone here who raises their hand and they can come and do

4
0:00:29.920 --> 0:00:33.480
the talk instead of me because they know better.

5
0:00:33.480 --> 0:00:37.520
But unfortunately none of you.

6
0:00:37.520 --> 0:00:43.400
I'm going to convince yourself, convince, no myself I'm already convinced, convince

7
0:00:43.400 --> 0:00:52.360
yourself that we can find us open source by small companies.

8
0:00:52.360 --> 0:00:56.400
We are giving 1% of the income to open source projects.

9
0:00:56.400 --> 0:01:00.960
I'm going to convince you that all of the small companies in open source can do that.

10
0:01:00.960 --> 0:01:07.320
And we can change, we can change much in the open source world with that.

11
0:01:07.320 --> 0:01:12.240
Do you know what it can be?

12
0:01:12.240 --> 0:01:15.240
23.1 million.

13
0:01:15.240 --> 0:01:17.240
Huh?

14
0:01:17.240 --> 0:01:19.240
Hard question.

15
0:01:19.240 --> 0:01:24.520
That's the number of small companies in the European Union.

16
0:01:24.520 --> 0:01:26.520
Wow.

17
0:01:26.520 --> 0:01:33.840
How many of them do the computer science, how many of them use open source every day?

18
0:01:33.840 --> 0:01:35.680
How many use open source every day?

19
0:01:35.680 --> 0:01:37.840
I would say half probably.

20
0:01:37.840 --> 0:01:44.400
But how many are contributing and are constant users of open source?

21
0:01:44.400 --> 0:01:46.480
Way harder to ask.

22
0:01:46.480 --> 0:01:53.600
I would assume that at least 5,000.

23
0:01:53.600 --> 0:02:03.360
Imagine now that 5,000 companies which is not that optimistic estimate, each of them

24
0:02:03.360 --> 0:02:05.840
giving 1,000 euros per year.

25
0:02:05.840 --> 0:02:08.920
The total budget you get is 5 million.

26
0:02:08.920 --> 0:02:11.120
What we can do for 5 million europe?

27
0:02:11.120 --> 0:02:12.120
Quite much.

28
0:02:12.120 --> 0:02:19.520
And 1,000 euros per company, it's not high number, it's really a pessimistic estimate.

29
0:02:19.520 --> 0:02:23.280
So we can do way better than that.

30
0:02:23.280 --> 0:02:27.720
Before we get to the details of the Prod.

31
0:02:27.720 --> 0:02:35.160
Smart Dictionary Check, we are in Europe, all of us talking about taxes, incomes and

32
0:02:35.160 --> 0:02:36.160
financial things.

33
0:02:36.160 --> 0:02:38.760
We are using our own languages.

34
0:02:38.760 --> 0:02:43.120
And we need to have a dictionary check when we are switching to English.

35
0:02:43.120 --> 0:02:51.280
So turnover, income, grocery venue, same thing, it's all sales of a company over a

36
0:02:51.280 --> 0:02:53.680
period of time, usually a year.

37
0:02:53.680 --> 0:02:59.080
And profit, it's earning minus all of the expenses that you have.

38
0:02:59.080 --> 0:03:07.520
What I'm convincing you that you can give one person of the income so all sales a year.

39
0:03:07.520 --> 0:03:14.160
Now my personal point of view.

40
0:03:14.160 --> 0:03:22.520
SyslineBit is a company running multiple economic activities under one roof and we are helping

41
0:03:22.520 --> 0:03:26.040
new activities and new people to be the activities.

42
0:03:26.040 --> 0:03:32.800
It's a pretty specific type of a company under the Fetch Law called CIO.

43
0:03:32.800 --> 0:03:35.960
We are concentrating on embedded and open source.

44
0:03:35.960 --> 0:03:38.120
So we are strong supporters of open source.

45
0:03:38.120 --> 0:03:44.520
Currently in our model, everyone is a consultant but we welcome production, system admins and

46
0:03:44.520 --> 0:03:47.560
all the types of activities.

47
0:03:47.560 --> 0:03:56.880
And now currently every consultant gives one person of their income to open source project.

48
0:03:56.880 --> 0:04:03.560
As we hold multiple independent activities, every person decides on their own to which

49
0:04:03.560 --> 0:04:09.640
project they want to give because we have different preferences.

50
0:04:09.640 --> 0:04:17.520
And I started that when it was a one person show when I started a company two years ago.

51
0:04:17.520 --> 0:04:27.560
A small reminder, one person of income means 1000 euros for every 100,000 of income.

52
0:04:27.560 --> 0:04:33.680
The idea of one person is not a new one, you have probably seen about one person for the

53
0:04:33.680 --> 0:04:34.680
planet.

54
0:04:34.680 --> 0:04:40.040
There have been a few initiatives of giving to open source but I think it's good to bring

55
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:48.320
the idea back because we are always, as always, missing money in open source.

56
0:04:48.320 --> 0:05:14.040
Now when a company gives a donation, what it needs, invoice.

57
0:05:14.040 --> 0:05:24.760
I will shout it too much, I think.

58
0:05:24.760 --> 0:05:31.000
When you're running a company, you need an invoice for every single expense you have.

59
0:05:31.000 --> 0:05:38.280
And if you pay first and then wait for the invoice, you have a risk of not getting it

60
0:05:38.280 --> 0:05:43.240
at all or getting after a long time.

61
0:05:43.240 --> 0:05:50.720
Last year I have given to one of the organizations in open source, everyone here knows and I'm

62
0:05:50.720 --> 0:05:54.360
not going to name because.

63
0:05:54.360 --> 0:06:00.920
And it took me like four or five months of email exchanges with a person who was very

64
0:06:00.920 --> 0:06:05.120
sorry that they cannot get to the person doing the invoices, they cannot give me a invoice,

65
0:06:05.120 --> 0:06:09.840
they are going to send them a message yet again and I was a month again, I was sending

66
0:06:09.840 --> 0:06:12.320
the message again.

67
0:06:12.320 --> 0:06:16.200
Somebody got my voice like five months later.

68
0:06:16.200 --> 0:06:23.160
That is risky, I was already thinking how to explain that to my accountant.

69
0:06:23.160 --> 0:06:30.560
A company can go through a method used by big companies, purchase order that the company

70
0:06:30.560 --> 0:06:37.320
gives, then the recipient of the money gives the invoice and then you pay.

71
0:06:37.320 --> 0:06:39.560
Problem, it's a burden.

72
0:06:39.560 --> 0:06:44.600
It's a burden to the organization you give and it's a burden for the company giving the

73
0:06:44.600 --> 0:06:46.360
money.

74
0:06:46.360 --> 0:06:54.720
But that's the solution I use for bigger donations when I cannot risk of not getting the invoice.

75
0:06:54.720 --> 0:07:02.480
For individuals, they are all the ways to donate.

76
0:07:02.480 --> 0:07:08.000
If a company wants to give money to an individual, that's complicated.

77
0:07:08.000 --> 0:07:16.280
For the tax reasons, for the legal reasons, so we are avoiding giving money directly to

78
0:07:16.280 --> 0:07:18.720
individuals.

79
0:07:18.720 --> 0:07:26.560
For cryptocurrencies, some projects accept cryptocurrencies.

80
0:07:26.560 --> 0:07:38.840
I leave you the question to ask your accountant and then you need to be sure you can run away

81
0:07:38.840 --> 0:07:44.080
from the place.

82
0:07:44.080 --> 0:07:51.400
The reaction varies but may be drastic when you talk to accountant about cryptocurrencies.

83
0:07:51.400 --> 0:08:01.120
So no, if you do not want to run into trouble, you do not donate in cryptocurrencies when

84
0:08:01.120 --> 0:08:04.560
you are running a company.

85
0:08:04.560 --> 0:08:10.920
Now, typical open source organizations supporting projects, what they offer for companies?

86
0:08:10.920 --> 0:08:15.960
Either yearly sponsoring or even sponsoring.

87
0:08:15.960 --> 0:08:24.680
That is something that exists for most organizations, typically sponsoring is from 1000 to 25,000

88
0:08:24.680 --> 0:08:28.200
euros depending on the level.

89
0:08:28.200 --> 0:08:34.240
Even sponsoring is between 500 to around 10,000 euros.

90
0:08:34.240 --> 0:08:41.520
Now we compare that with what a small company can give.

91
0:08:41.520 --> 0:08:44.040
In a small company, I have an alternative.

92
0:08:44.040 --> 0:08:57.000
Either I give 1000 euros to one project eventually too or I give 100 euros to way more projects.

93
0:08:57.000 --> 0:09:03.160
For people who live in open source, we know that if I give to project X, someone will

94
0:09:03.160 --> 0:09:11.620
ask, but why you are not giving to project Y and Z and some more, right?

95
0:09:11.620 --> 0:09:17.880
Because if you are going to one project, it's fair to give to all others.

96
0:09:17.880 --> 0:09:24.160
Opinions differ inside the company who is using which project in their products.

97
0:09:24.160 --> 0:09:25.160
Exactly.

98
0:09:25.160 --> 0:09:36.280
At the end, what happens is you want to give smaller amounts to more projects.

99
0:09:36.280 --> 0:09:43.080
That is exactly not in line with what the organization supporting open source have as

100
0:09:43.080 --> 0:09:48.920
an offer.

101
0:09:48.920 --> 0:09:54.240
Our way of doing the donation is giving directly to organizations.

102
0:09:54.240 --> 0:10:00.520
We establish the way of how to do the payment.

103
0:10:00.520 --> 0:10:06.240
Either they have an account that you can create and then donate or you need to contact some

104
0:10:06.240 --> 0:10:11.240
email address and figure out the details.

105
0:10:11.240 --> 0:10:13.240
Things vary.

106
0:10:13.240 --> 0:10:21.160
Then when we have the method set up, we have that organization now, a database, and every

107
0:10:21.160 --> 0:10:27.000
transaction later, it goes the same way and it works.

108
0:10:27.000 --> 0:10:35.720
There are other ways using aggregators like GitHub sponsors, Open Source Collective, or

109
0:10:35.720 --> 0:10:38.040
Phoenix Foundation crowdfunding.

110
0:10:38.040 --> 0:10:43.600
And there has been a talk about the subject by Wolfgang at the Open Source Summit Europe

111
0:10:43.600 --> 0:10:45.040
last year.

112
0:10:45.040 --> 0:10:50.480
He had a pretty different approach because that was from the approach of a big company

113
0:10:50.480 --> 0:10:58.720
with more internal difficulties of having the donations done than we have in small companies,

114
0:10:58.720 --> 0:11:08.240
but still his analysis of the ways you can donate is pretty interesting.

115
0:11:08.240 --> 0:11:18.600
Now is it hard to donate to an open source project by a company?

116
0:11:18.600 --> 0:11:25.320
Financially the amount of money, one person, if you compare it to different expenses you

117
0:11:25.320 --> 0:11:36.000
have in a company, accounting, rent, internet access, electricity of whatever you have,

118
0:11:36.000 --> 0:11:42.240
it will be in the small things that you have on the company bill.

119
0:11:42.240 --> 0:11:46.440
So it's not really that hard to do.

120
0:11:46.440 --> 0:11:51.440
What is a little bit more complicated is the organization.

121
0:11:51.440 --> 0:12:00.720
And what I found out is most complex is actually deciding to which project you want to give,

122
0:12:00.720 --> 0:12:06.480
even in a company when everyone agrees, we want to give.

123
0:12:06.480 --> 0:12:12.040
A lot of discussions and decision making on how to do that.

124
0:12:12.040 --> 0:12:16.720
And then important thing, collect and document the payment procedure if you're not going

125
0:12:16.720 --> 0:12:19.560
through an aggregate.

126
0:12:19.560 --> 0:12:28.560
Now you have to ask why.

127
0:12:28.560 --> 0:12:33.920
Project work as they can.

128
0:12:33.920 --> 0:12:38.760
And when you are already doing open source you can say that you are already contributing

129
0:12:38.760 --> 0:12:45.920
and there's a kind of donation you are already doing.

130
0:12:45.920 --> 0:12:52.080
I would say that this is an addition to the work you are doing because you cannot take

131
0:12:52.080 --> 0:12:57.200
maintainership in every single project you are using in your product.

132
0:12:57.200 --> 0:12:59.160
That is just not possible.

133
0:12:59.160 --> 0:13:07.880
And this is the maintainers work, infrastructure, all those hard to sell us new features that

134
0:13:07.880 --> 0:13:11.880
need financing the most.

135
0:13:11.880 --> 0:13:16.800
In my opinion that works easiest with the money because you can just pay someone spending

136
0:13:16.800 --> 0:13:21.540
their time on doing those tasks.

137
0:13:21.540 --> 0:13:30.500
And then a subject related to the presentation before, currently quite many organizations

138
0:13:30.500 --> 0:13:41.600
I was involved with, they in reality depend on donation from a small number of big companies.

139
0:13:41.600 --> 0:13:45.820
Give a part of individual donations that they receive.

140
0:13:45.820 --> 0:13:54.120
So if you can break that dependency and make sure that those projects have more stable

141
0:13:54.120 --> 0:14:03.600
and more diversified way of getting the income, that is going to improve the stability and

142
0:14:03.600 --> 0:14:10.960
at the end is going to improve the quality of the code we all depend on.

143
0:14:10.960 --> 0:14:16.680
So are you ready to try it out in your company?

144
0:14:16.680 --> 0:14:25.000
Or do you have any questions, subjects for discussions?

145
0:14:25.000 --> 0:14:29.720
In the meantime we try to fix the microphone.

146
0:14:29.720 --> 0:14:37.720
So take a bit of time as a question then.

147
0:14:37.720 --> 0:14:46.120
What can open source projects do to make this easier?

148
0:14:46.120 --> 0:14:51.760
For example, something that I run a scientific open source project we are looking at trying

149
0:14:51.760 --> 0:14:55.880
to incorporate as a nonprofit because we think that will be more attractive and we are trying

150
0:14:55.880 --> 0:14:59.280
to figure out where to do that and deal with all of the international stuff.

151
0:14:59.280 --> 0:15:01.640
It's a whole thing.

152
0:15:01.640 --> 0:15:06.880
So I guess what do you see from the small business perspective as to what projects can

153
0:15:06.880 --> 0:15:18.200
do to make your giving us money easier?

154
0:15:18.200 --> 0:15:22.160
Maybe we collect some questions first and then in between we can fix the mic issue.

155
0:15:22.160 --> 0:15:25.520
Would it be fine for you?

156
0:15:25.520 --> 0:15:33.440
So that's why maybe we collect some questions?

157
0:15:33.440 --> 0:15:37.640
The question is how a project can make it easier.

158
0:15:37.640 --> 0:15:40.760
For me it's very simple.

159
0:15:40.760 --> 0:15:54.400
Have a legal entity that can create invoices or any legal proof of payment for the amount

160
0:15:54.400 --> 0:16:01.120
and make it easy for a company to do that.

161
0:16:01.120 --> 0:16:11.040
Make it easy in such a way that when you get a message that we want to give you 500 euros,

162
0:16:11.040 --> 0:16:22.040
we get a response rapidly that increases confidence that's going to work.

163
0:16:22.040 --> 0:16:33.160
And then you can, if you are ready to send an invoice just at the moment of payment,

164
0:16:33.160 --> 0:16:36.160
that helps.

165
0:16:36.160 --> 0:16:40.580
If you have a system that generates invoices it's even better.

166
0:16:40.580 --> 0:16:45.020
You can use online invoice generation systems that exist.

167
0:16:45.020 --> 0:16:48.080
If you can use it it's even easier for everyone.

168
0:16:48.080 --> 0:16:54.840
But it's really simple fast reaction time and getting the invoice easily.

169
0:16:54.840 --> 0:17:04.640
If I have those two I will be willing to donate again.

170
0:17:04.640 --> 0:17:10.480
So we have another question over here.

171
0:17:10.480 --> 0:17:16.680
So mainly the perspective on this was by a company's perspective.

172
0:17:16.680 --> 0:17:23.520
And this topic has been discussed by the technical committee just recently as I'm part of that.

173
0:17:23.520 --> 0:17:30.180
And Node.js is part of the foundation and money is actually not an issue.

174
0:17:30.180 --> 0:17:31.520
That's not the main problem.

175
0:17:31.520 --> 0:17:38.480
What we need is actually people donating their time and effort into projects.

176
0:17:38.480 --> 0:17:41.640
And that is way more valuable as such.

177
0:17:41.640 --> 0:17:47.320
So if a company instead of investing money because it's really difficult even for an

178
0:17:47.320 --> 0:17:51.480
organization you have to decide who's actually going to get that money.

179
0:17:51.480 --> 0:17:52.960
Do we pay someone?

180
0:17:52.960 --> 0:17:55.240
What is with the others who contributed?

181
0:17:55.240 --> 0:18:00.320
It's a really tough question to answer if it's not a single contributor to this open

182
0:18:00.320 --> 0:18:02.960
source project.

183
0:18:02.960 --> 0:18:11.520
And therefore if you pay someone from your company to work on that project that is mostly

184
0:18:11.520 --> 0:18:14.760
really really valuable.

185
0:18:14.760 --> 0:18:20.600
Thank you.

186
0:18:20.600 --> 0:18:23.520
That was a pretty important subject.

187
0:18:23.520 --> 0:18:31.760
In a situation where the money is not really an issue people are an issue.

188
0:18:31.760 --> 0:18:38.500
And my answer here will depend on the type of the development we are on.

189
0:18:38.500 --> 0:18:48.760
In my case for most of the projects we donate small amounts like 100 euros per year to 100

190
0:18:48.760 --> 0:18:49.760
euros per year.

191
0:18:49.760 --> 0:18:55.800
That amount of money doesn't allow you to hire anyone to work on the project.

192
0:18:55.800 --> 0:19:04.120
What would be possible would be to donate to an organization that will hire that person

193
0:19:04.120 --> 0:19:08.600
and have multiple companies donate to that person and then hire.

194
0:19:08.600 --> 0:19:17.200
Also hiring someone for a small company it's an important risk if you don't have funding.

195
0:19:17.200 --> 0:19:21.880
Hiring someone for me is more of an approach.

196
0:19:21.880 --> 0:19:25.560
Either you have a business model closely related with the project.

197
0:19:25.560 --> 0:19:31.400
If you are really doing money with that specific project then it makes sense.

198
0:19:31.400 --> 0:19:38.320
Or if you are a company of like 50 then you can probably allow that.

199
0:19:38.320 --> 0:19:42.200
For small companies I think it's a little bit more complicated unfortunately.

200
0:19:42.200 --> 0:19:46.960
We also try to...

201
0:19:46.960 --> 0:19:49.240
We have another question over there.

202
0:19:49.240 --> 0:19:53.160
I'd like to highlight a service by a small NGO from Berlin.

203
0:19:53.160 --> 0:19:58.940
It's called the Center for Cultivation of Technology which is like a back end to open

204
0:19:58.940 --> 0:20:03.760
source projects so they're registered non-profits in Berlin.

205
0:20:03.760 --> 0:20:11.960
If you are a small open source project which doesn't have a company somewhere or a legal

206
0:20:11.960 --> 0:20:17.240
name to yourself you can go there and say hey I'm an open source project and they could

207
0:20:17.240 --> 0:20:19.800
act as a trustee.

208
0:20:19.800 --> 0:20:26.920
They receive donations and they can hold that for your project so companies can get invoices

209
0:20:26.920 --> 0:20:34.120
or checks that the money has been sent there and the software devs don't have to care about

210
0:20:34.120 --> 0:20:36.800
all the financial stuff for that.

211
0:20:36.800 --> 0:20:41.720
So there is like a back end to support open source projects and to make invoicing more

212
0:20:41.720 --> 0:20:46.520
easier and at no cost.

213
0:20:46.520 --> 0:20:48.440
You want to respond to that?

214
0:20:48.440 --> 0:20:50.400
Just a comment.

215
0:20:50.400 --> 0:20:51.640
A small comment for that.

216
0:20:51.640 --> 0:20:53.360
Thank you for doing this.

217
0:20:53.360 --> 0:20:53.360
If you could send me details of the financial

218
0:20:55.360 --> 0:21:00.360
initiatives that allow that aggregating payments for different projects.

219
0:21:00.360 --> 0:21:01.360
Okay.

220
0:21:01.360 --> 0:21:02.360
Test one, two.

221
0:21:02.360 --> 0:21:09.360
My question is well I thank you for mentioning fiscal sponsorship organizations and I want

222
0:21:09.360 --> 0:21:20.360
to give a yes software freedom conservancy is a fiscal sponsor organization as well as

223
0:21:20.360 --> 0:21:21.360
there are many others.

224
0:21:21.360 --> 0:21:27.680
I know that several of us are very interested in making sure that the projects we accept

225
0:21:27.680 --> 0:21:34.400
and therefore take donations for have great governance and so there can be trust as far

226
0:21:34.400 --> 0:21:39.920
as making sure that funds are donated or used for the project and are used wisely.

227
0:21:39.920 --> 0:21:48.120
How do you evaluate governance for these donations or do you not because there's smaller donations?

228
0:21:48.120 --> 0:21:50.800
I think we are trying to test.

229
0:21:50.800 --> 0:21:51.800
It's working.

230
0:21:51.800 --> 0:21:52.800
Okay.

231
0:21:52.800 --> 0:21:57.280
The question was how we evaluate that the money is going to be well spent.

232
0:21:57.280 --> 0:22:00.720
I'm taking a shortcut.

233
0:22:00.720 --> 0:22:04.320
We are donating to the projects we know very well.

234
0:22:04.320 --> 0:22:05.320
So that's easy.

235
0:22:05.320 --> 0:22:08.160
We know the governance.

236
0:22:08.160 --> 0:22:11.920
We know how they work.

237
0:22:11.920 --> 0:22:15.920
So the check is easy.

238
0:22:15.920 --> 0:22:23.920
Getting to projects that we know less I would definitely agree that getting to a project

239
0:22:23.920 --> 0:22:33.880
that is in some aggregator that has policies on the governments that's an additional plus

240
0:22:33.880 --> 0:22:41.200
something point for this project to actually donate it then to a project that we just absolutely

241
0:22:41.200 --> 0:22:42.920
do not know how they work.

242
0:22:42.920 --> 0:22:45.280
What's going to happen.

243
0:22:45.280 --> 0:22:48.960
The answer to an email after a month and things like that.

244
0:22:48.960 --> 0:22:54.000
That's definitely a bonus point for the projects to getting a donation.

245
0:22:54.000 --> 0:22:55.000
Absolutely.

246
0:22:55.000 --> 0:22:56.000
Okay.

247
0:22:56.000 --> 0:23:00.080
So we have another question over here.

248
0:23:00.080 --> 0:23:11.960
So coming back to what you said earlier, like at least when you're a computer company, then

249
0:23:11.960 --> 0:23:17.640
you can definitely let someone work at least part time on open source.

250
0:23:17.640 --> 0:23:19.840
That would be something really valuable again.

251
0:23:19.840 --> 0:23:25.200
I encourage people in my company that are working to work on open source and we have

252
0:23:25.200 --> 0:23:28.840
dedicated time that they may invest into that.

253
0:23:28.840 --> 0:23:36.760
And even as a small company, I was able to work on open source because we used open source

254
0:23:36.760 --> 0:23:43.080
and we ran into bugs, for example, while developing things and then I discussed that with the

255
0:23:43.080 --> 0:23:45.600
leadership at that point of time.

256
0:23:45.600 --> 0:23:50.480
Instead of having a workaround built into the application that we are currently building

257
0:23:50.480 --> 0:23:55.680
as a closed source, hey, why am I not going to fix that bug in that open source library

258
0:23:55.680 --> 0:23:57.320
that we are currently using?

259
0:23:57.320 --> 0:23:59.320
And that's what I did.

260
0:23:59.320 --> 0:24:07.280
One more, right?

261
0:24:07.280 --> 0:24:11.280
I think you have my mic.

262
0:24:11.280 --> 0:24:12.280
I have my mic.

263
0:24:12.280 --> 0:24:13.280
Sure.

264
0:24:13.280 --> 0:24:15.280
I completely agree.

265
0:24:15.280 --> 0:24:21.400
The money part for me is in addition to all the other open source work you do.

266
0:24:21.400 --> 0:24:29.160
We as an open source company, we propose to our customers to upstream they code that we

267
0:24:29.160 --> 0:24:34.040
tell them we can upstream the patches that you have, the fixes that you have.

268
0:24:34.040 --> 0:24:43.760
We can help you with working with the open source work for your project.

269
0:24:43.760 --> 0:24:48.960
The money part is in addition to that, if you are already open source citizen, that's

270
0:24:48.960 --> 0:24:50.760
already great.

271
0:24:50.760 --> 0:24:56.640
But what I found out is that quite many projects.

272
0:24:56.640 --> 0:25:03.120
I'm involved in York store, so that's I have a lot of experience in that.

273
0:25:03.120 --> 0:25:10.840
That's the maintenance part that requires time and convincing customers to have people

274
0:25:10.840 --> 0:25:13.120
working and maintainers.

275
0:25:13.120 --> 0:25:17.520
It's even a problem for the Linux kernel.

276
0:25:17.520 --> 0:25:19.080
So it's a bigger problem.

277
0:25:19.080 --> 0:25:25.560
And I think that without financing people separately from that, it's not really going

278
0:25:25.560 --> 0:25:26.560
to happen.

279
0:25:26.560 --> 0:25:30.480
It's already happened with different funding for different open source projects for the

280
0:25:30.480 --> 0:25:32.480
maintenance part.

281
0:25:32.480 --> 0:25:37.720
And if you can go forward with that, that's going to help.

282
0:25:37.720 --> 0:25:39.720
Time's up.

283
0:25:39.720 --> 0:25:57.280
I'm happy to discuss with all of you in the corridors.
