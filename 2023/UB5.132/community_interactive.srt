1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.640
Before we get started, we actually have an empty chair.

2
0:00:10.640 --> 0:00:16.240
So anybody want to raise their hand to be a panelist?

3
0:00:16.240 --> 0:00:17.240
Contestant?

4
0:00:17.240 --> 0:00:18.240
Contestant.

5
0:00:18.240 --> 0:00:19.240
Come on.

6
0:00:19.240 --> 0:00:20.240
Woo!

7
0:00:20.240 --> 0:00:21.240
Awesome.

8
0:00:21.240 --> 0:00:24.240
Catch his name.

9
0:00:24.240 --> 0:00:31.240
George.

10
0:00:31.240 --> 0:00:37.240
George.

11
0:00:37.240 --> 0:00:45.240
Alrighty.

12
0:00:45.240 --> 0:00:50.240
Guess we'll just get started.

13
0:00:50.240 --> 0:00:56.160
Hi, I'm Shirley and this is the first time we thought we'd try this out in the community

14
0:00:56.160 --> 0:01:01.160
dev room because everyone's sort of sitting around all day learning things, which is a

15
0:01:01.160 --> 0:01:05.840
great thing, but we thought we'd try to have some fun as well and engagement.

16
0:01:05.840 --> 0:01:06.840
So we'll see how it goes.

17
0:01:06.840 --> 0:01:08.440
A little bit weak in here.

18
0:01:08.440 --> 0:01:11.560
It is lunchtime, but maybe nobody likes to have fun.

19
0:01:11.560 --> 0:01:12.560
We'll see.

20
0:01:12.560 --> 0:01:14.560
So just a community minute.

21
0:01:14.560 --> 0:01:18.240
Some of you might have heard of the game show just a minute.

22
0:01:18.240 --> 0:01:21.840
It's a British game show from the 60s.

23
0:01:21.840 --> 0:01:30.840
It's a radio comedy show with a panel of folks and essentially you have a couple of topics

24
0:01:30.840 --> 0:01:36.480
that you'll throw at them and our esteemed panelists will have to answer 60 seconds to

25
0:01:36.480 --> 0:01:40.880
answer or talk to the topic that they're going to be presented with.

26
0:01:40.880 --> 0:01:45.820
So if you have heard of just a minute, it was originally hosted by Nicholas Parsons.

27
0:01:45.820 --> 0:01:50.320
He hosted it for about 50 something years before he unfortunately passed away.

28
0:01:50.320 --> 0:01:52.600
And then Sue Perkins has recently taken over.

29
0:01:52.600 --> 0:01:56.480
You might recognize her from the great British Bake Off.

30
0:01:56.480 --> 0:01:59.000
But again, rules of the game.

31
0:01:59.000 --> 0:02:01.280
Each person goes when it's their turn.

32
0:02:01.280 --> 0:02:02.280
They get one minute.

33
0:02:02.280 --> 0:02:07.520
They have to answer on the topic with no hesitation at all.

34
0:02:07.520 --> 0:02:15.320
So the full three golden rules, no hesitation, no repetition, no deviation.

35
0:02:15.320 --> 0:02:23.600
So for example, if the topic provided is bananas, Dawn would have to talk about bananas for

36
0:02:23.600 --> 0:02:30.680
full 60 seconds, never repeating the word banana, never deviating and talking about

37
0:02:30.680 --> 0:02:34.120
pineapples and not hesitating.

38
0:02:34.120 --> 0:02:39.920
If any of those three things are met, her fellow contestants hit the buzzer.

39
0:02:39.920 --> 0:02:43.000
And unfortunately, this was the cheapest thing I could find that didn't have wires.

40
0:02:43.000 --> 0:02:45.760
So you can test your buzzers now.

41
0:02:45.760 --> 0:02:51.880
By the way, those are children's learning tools.

42
0:02:51.880 --> 0:02:54.800
$24 on Amazon.

43
0:02:54.800 --> 0:02:59.320
So I should say, sorry, George, I didn't have you in time.

44
0:02:59.320 --> 0:03:04.160
We're not quite sitting in order, but we have spot in the middle sort of ish, Dawn, Ray

45
0:03:04.160 --> 0:03:06.840
and George at the end.

46
0:03:06.840 --> 0:03:10.640
So let's get started.

47
0:03:10.640 --> 0:03:14.640
We'll start with Dawn.

48
0:03:14.640 --> 0:03:15.640
Once I see the topic, we'll start.

49
0:03:15.640 --> 0:03:16.640
Can you hear me?

50
0:03:16.640 --> 0:03:17.640
Yes.

51
0:03:17.640 --> 0:03:18.640
I'm good.

52
0:03:18.640 --> 0:03:19.640
All right.

53
0:03:19.640 --> 0:03:20.640
Okay.

54
0:03:20.640 --> 0:03:25.880
So Dawn, your topic is things that make people crazy.

55
0:03:25.880 --> 0:03:30.040
Things that make people crazy.

56
0:03:30.040 --> 0:03:34.400
There are lots of things that make people crazy.

57
0:03:34.400 --> 0:03:36.760
Spiders are one of mine.

58
0:03:36.760 --> 0:03:38.760
Absolutely bonkers.

59
0:03:38.760 --> 0:03:45.500
And I think a lot of people, crowds, like we've got here at FOSDEM, I think those often

60
0:03:45.500 --> 0:03:49.280
make people, not the word I'm going to repeat.

61
0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:52.280
And there are lots of others too.

62
0:03:52.280 --> 0:03:56.280
I think maybe birds.

63
0:03:56.280 --> 0:04:03.880
You know, there was that movie, The Birds, that I think also makes people kind of bonkers.

64
0:04:03.880 --> 0:04:08.880
More movies.

65
0:04:08.880 --> 0:04:09.880
Yep.

66
0:04:09.880 --> 0:04:10.880
It does.

67
0:04:10.880 --> 0:04:11.880
Okay.

68
0:04:11.880 --> 0:04:12.880
All right.

69
0:04:12.880 --> 0:04:13.880
Very good.

70
0:04:13.880 --> 0:04:14.880
I'm glad I'm done.

71
0:04:14.880 --> 0:04:19.880
So now, so the mic goes to George to continue the rest of the...

72
0:04:19.880 --> 0:04:20.880
Yes.

73
0:04:20.880 --> 0:04:26.520
Crowsball, you have the remaining time to, on the topic, things that make people crazy.

74
0:04:26.520 --> 0:04:32.000
Well, I was thinking about things that make developers crazy is when you do a lock and

75
0:04:32.000 --> 0:04:34.000
you don't do an unlock, that makes you crazy.

76
0:04:34.000 --> 0:04:38.640
It makes you crazy.

77
0:04:38.640 --> 0:04:39.640
You said crazy.

78
0:04:39.640 --> 0:04:41.640
Oh, you can't say crazy?

79
0:04:41.640 --> 0:04:42.640
Yes.

80
0:04:42.640 --> 0:04:45.800
You can't say more than once.

81
0:04:45.800 --> 0:04:48.360
If it's the topic, you can't say it more than once.

82
0:04:48.360 --> 0:04:50.200
Seven seconds remaining.

83
0:04:50.200 --> 0:05:01.360
I think the other thing that drive me crazy is long lines.

84
0:05:01.360 --> 0:05:02.360
Okay.

85
0:05:02.360 --> 0:05:03.360
Done, right?

86
0:05:03.360 --> 0:05:04.360
Yep.

87
0:05:04.360 --> 0:05:05.360
All right.

88
0:05:05.360 --> 0:05:10.760
Mic goes to spot.

89
0:05:10.760 --> 0:05:12.760
Your topic is beer.

90
0:05:12.760 --> 0:05:13.760
Beer.

91
0:05:13.760 --> 0:05:19.560
So, last night I went out and had far too much of this liquid goodness that is flowing

92
0:05:19.560 --> 0:05:21.240
all over Brussels.

93
0:05:21.240 --> 0:05:26.120
And unfortunately, no one bothered to tell me how strong some of them were.

94
0:05:26.120 --> 0:05:30.160
And I may be feeling some of the repercussions of my experiences.

95
0:05:30.160 --> 0:05:34.920
And I apologize in advance if this has impeded the verbosity of what I've been able to deliver

96
0:05:34.920 --> 0:05:36.600
to you fine fellows.

97
0:05:36.600 --> 0:05:42.080
And I want you all to know that you should not take my example as an action not to mirror.

98
0:05:42.080 --> 0:05:46.400
Because I think it's important that you go out and you try all of that beer because you

99
0:05:46.400 --> 0:05:57.040
will not know what you're missing if you do not take this opportunity.

100
0:05:57.040 --> 0:06:01.400
So I actually don't drink that tasty beverage.

101
0:06:01.400 --> 0:06:05.200
It's one of the only things that I will not drink.

102
0:06:05.200 --> 0:06:06.200
Alcohol is fine.

103
0:06:06.200 --> 0:06:08.360
For some reason, I just can't get into it.

104
0:06:08.360 --> 0:06:12.780
So being here, I think is maybe kind of wasted on me.

105
0:06:12.780 --> 0:06:14.240
My partner, though, comes with me.

106
0:06:14.240 --> 0:06:16.720
And he certainly imbibes in all of it.

107
0:06:16.720 --> 0:06:17.720
Ooh.

108
0:06:17.720 --> 0:06:19.320
Way closer to that.

109
0:06:19.320 --> 0:06:20.320
Well done.

110
0:06:20.320 --> 0:06:22.200
Since you don't drink beer.

111
0:06:22.200 --> 0:06:23.200
All right.

112
0:06:23.200 --> 0:06:26.160
The mic goes to Ray.

113
0:06:26.160 --> 0:06:30.280
So just to switch things up, we're going to have the audience pick a topic.

114
0:06:30.280 --> 0:06:33.280
Anybody want to throw away a topic?

115
0:06:33.280 --> 0:06:35.280
Books.

116
0:06:35.280 --> 0:06:37.280
Books.

117
0:06:37.280 --> 0:06:43.800
I enjoy reading them.

118
0:06:43.800 --> 0:06:47.980
But my problem is I have a short attention span.

119
0:06:47.980 --> 0:06:54.400
So it takes me a long time to finish consuming the content.

120
0:06:54.400 --> 0:07:01.000
I wrote one of these ones a long time ago.

121
0:07:01.000 --> 0:07:05.400
And one of the things that I learned from that experience was that having an incredibly

122
0:07:05.400 --> 0:07:07.640
good editor is key to success.

123
0:07:07.640 --> 0:07:11.880
And if you don't have one of those, then you find yourself in a position where you hate

124
0:07:11.880 --> 0:07:13.140
everything about it.

125
0:07:13.140 --> 0:07:14.680
You don't want to look at the computer.

126
0:07:14.680 --> 0:07:18.360
You don't want to look at the horrible interface that O'Reilly has built for you to put these

127
0:07:18.360 --> 0:07:20.360
words into play.

128
0:07:20.360 --> 0:07:24.960
There's so much pain and suffering and you wake up in the morning and you think, why

129
0:07:24.960 --> 0:07:28.760
in the world did I ever agree to this and why did I sneak into the O'Reilly party in

130
0:07:28.760 --> 0:07:29.760
the first place?

131
0:07:29.760 --> 0:07:32.200
What is wrong with me?

132
0:07:32.200 --> 0:07:37.360
But I think that that should not discourage any of you from the audience from doing that.

133
0:07:37.360 --> 0:07:40.560
You should take the time to write.

134
0:07:40.560 --> 0:07:42.560
Well done.

135
0:07:42.560 --> 0:07:44.560
All right.

136
0:07:44.560 --> 0:07:46.320
George, you're up.

137
0:07:46.320 --> 0:07:48.320
Your topic is DevRel.

138
0:07:48.320 --> 0:07:57.720
DevRel is a thing which I just heard about today as I was looking at what a developer

139
0:07:57.720 --> 0:07:59.200
advocate was.

140
0:07:59.200 --> 0:08:03.680
But I've been in community management for a long time and I think certainly it's an

141
0:08:03.680 --> 0:08:05.280
important topic.

142
0:08:05.280 --> 0:08:07.120
Developers are very important.

143
0:08:07.120 --> 0:08:11.920
And it can often be frustrating when you have new developers.

144
0:08:11.920 --> 0:08:16.920
I'm going to say developers in more time.

145
0:08:16.920 --> 0:08:19.920
I mean, it's a scam and I'm here to tell you that.

146
0:08:19.920 --> 0:08:25.680
We need to put a stop to this before it takes out any more innocent people.

147
0:08:25.680 --> 0:08:28.480
The victims are crying in the streets.

148
0:08:28.480 --> 0:08:33.440
Why do we continue to perpetuate the idea that this is something that anyone should

149
0:08:33.440 --> 0:08:35.720
be trying to do in any sense?

150
0:08:35.720 --> 0:08:36.840
Because it's not.

151
0:08:36.840 --> 0:08:37.840
It's bad.

152
0:08:37.840 --> 0:08:38.840
It's harmful.

153
0:08:38.840 --> 0:08:40.280
And I'm not afraid to say it on video.

154
0:08:40.280 --> 0:08:44.680
I think that we need more people who are willing to speak up against this.

155
0:08:44.680 --> 0:08:47.680
Stop the madness right now.

156
0:08:47.680 --> 0:08:51.680
Nobody wants to fall in.

157
0:08:51.680 --> 0:09:00.640
I'm still having problems figuring out what the delineation is between DevRel marketing

158
0:09:00.640 --> 0:09:03.640
community.

159
0:09:03.640 --> 0:09:04.640
Easy point for Ray.

160
0:09:04.640 --> 0:09:07.640
I'm not fired by the way.

161
0:09:07.640 --> 0:09:08.640
All right.

162
0:09:08.640 --> 0:09:13.960
We're going to go back to Don.

163
0:09:13.960 --> 0:09:19.480
How to cook eggs.

164
0:09:19.480 --> 0:09:21.200
So I'm a vegan.

165
0:09:21.200 --> 0:09:25.200
And so I don't actually cook eggs.

166
0:09:25.200 --> 0:09:29.280
But I have seen people cook these things.

167
0:09:29.280 --> 0:09:34.520
When our friends come over, so my partner has been friends with people who went to uni

168
0:09:34.520 --> 0:09:36.400
with 20 some years ago.

169
0:09:36.400 --> 0:09:39.520
They all come over on New Year's Eve.

170
0:09:39.520 --> 0:09:45.520
And we did make eggs and sausage for the team.

171
0:09:45.520 --> 0:09:48.800
And my partner cooked these things in the microwave, which I thought was maybe a little

172
0:09:48.800 --> 0:09:50.760
bit weird because I'd always seen people.

173
0:09:50.760 --> 0:09:52.760
You know, you see people on TV.

174
0:09:52.760 --> 0:09:53.760
And they put them in a pan.

175
0:09:53.760 --> 0:09:55.760
And they cook them for a while.

176
0:09:55.760 --> 0:09:58.240
And then halfway through, they flip them over.

177
0:09:58.240 --> 0:10:00.720
And then, you know, they wait a little bit longer.

178
0:10:00.720 --> 0:10:06.080
And then they put them on a plate with some toast and some probably meat.

179
0:10:06.080 --> 0:10:07.080
I don't know.

180
0:10:07.080 --> 0:10:09.400
Because like I said, I don't actually eat these things.

181
0:10:09.400 --> 0:10:14.200
But I think that when you cook them, you also put like oil or butter in the pan.

182
0:10:14.200 --> 0:10:17.480
And I think that's part of the process.

183
0:10:17.480 --> 0:10:21.640
And then you can also serve them.

184
0:10:21.640 --> 0:10:23.640
Oh, good.

185
0:10:23.640 --> 0:10:25.640
I'm like, grrr.

186
0:10:25.640 --> 0:10:27.640
I'm really slow.

187
0:10:27.640 --> 0:10:29.640
Did she get the home in it?

188
0:10:29.640 --> 0:10:31.640
Yep.

189
0:10:31.640 --> 0:10:33.640
Well done.

190
0:10:33.640 --> 0:10:35.640
I could say eggs twice.

191
0:10:35.640 --> 0:10:39.640
I was waiting for it right after I said it the second time.

192
0:10:39.640 --> 0:10:41.640
All right, Spot.

193
0:10:41.640 --> 0:10:43.640
Anything about not cheating?

194
0:10:43.640 --> 0:10:45.640
You have to catch one another.

195
0:10:45.640 --> 0:10:47.640
We're all verified to follow up.

196
0:10:47.640 --> 0:10:49.640
Spot, you're up.

197
0:10:49.640 --> 0:10:51.640
The internet.

198
0:10:51.640 --> 0:10:58.640
I keep this in a box on my desk because if I didn't, then what would the repercussions be?

199
0:10:58.640 --> 0:11:00.640
Will no one think of the children?

200
0:11:00.640 --> 0:11:02.640
I know I'm harping on this today.

201
0:11:02.640 --> 0:11:07.640
But it's important that we all factor in the youth when we look at the applications of the internet.

202
0:11:07.640 --> 0:11:09.640
I mean, really, what good has it brought us?

203
0:11:09.640 --> 0:11:11.640
It did not bring us here together.

204
0:11:11.640 --> 0:11:13.640
Well, maybe it did.

205
0:11:13.640 --> 0:11:15.640
But it did not give us ideas.

206
0:11:15.640 --> 0:11:17.640
Well, it could have.

207
0:11:17.640 --> 0:11:19.640
But these things are not important.

208
0:11:19.640 --> 0:11:23.640
What is important is that there is a square feature that involves cables and blinking lights.

209
0:11:23.640 --> 0:11:27.640
And if we don't have those blinking lights, come on, you all beat me up.

210
0:11:27.640 --> 0:11:29.640
I'm trying.

211
0:11:29.640 --> 0:11:31.640
Thank you.

212
0:11:31.640 --> 0:11:34.640
Good thing or a bad thing, I haven't figured it out.

213
0:11:34.640 --> 0:11:35.640
It's been around.

214
0:11:35.640 --> 0:11:38.640
Everybody uses them all the time.

215
0:11:38.640 --> 0:11:39.640
Are we addicted?

216
0:11:39.640 --> 0:11:41.640
I'm not sure.

217
0:11:45.640 --> 0:11:56.640
It's basically a series of tubes that go from one place to another, and they're full of data and goodness and also...

218
0:11:56.640 --> 0:11:57.640
You did it.

219
0:11:57.640 --> 0:11:59.640
I've heard that times.

220
0:11:59.640 --> 0:12:01.640
Well done, George.

221
0:12:01.640 --> 0:12:02.640
So are the internet.

222
0:12:02.640 --> 0:12:05.640
All right, Lee, it's back to you.

223
0:12:05.640 --> 0:12:08.640
A technology you love.

224
0:12:11.640 --> 0:12:13.640
Technology I love.

225
0:12:13.640 --> 0:12:15.640
Wheels.

226
0:12:15.640 --> 0:12:18.640
Shoes.

227
0:12:18.640 --> 0:12:21.640
Lights.

228
0:12:21.640 --> 0:12:24.640
Electricity.

229
0:12:24.640 --> 0:12:27.640
Cars.

230
0:12:27.640 --> 0:12:29.640
Batteries.

231
0:12:29.640 --> 0:12:31.640
I've been fascinated with...

232
0:12:31.640 --> 0:12:35.640
I went to an energy track yesterday, and they were talking about, like, EVs.

233
0:12:35.640 --> 0:12:41.640
It was pretty interesting about how you can not only charge your car, but discharge and make money.

234
0:12:41.640 --> 0:12:50.640
And it was amazing that this person only spent in the Netherlands 200 euros to charge his car for, like, over 10 months.

235
0:12:50.640 --> 0:12:55.640
And the Netherlands is not a place that you think of that has a lot of solar energy supply,

236
0:12:55.640 --> 0:12:57.640
but I was pretty impressed with something.

237
0:12:57.640 --> 0:13:03.640
I just bought a vehicle with the battery, so it's something I'll have to think about.

238
0:13:03.640 --> 0:13:11.640
But he did have to do a lot of hacking with open source software, but I thought it was pretty amazing and commendable.

239
0:13:11.640 --> 0:13:16.640
But hopefully that kind of platform will be available for a lot of people.

240
0:13:16.640 --> 0:13:18.640
So is that a minute?

241
0:13:18.640 --> 0:13:20.640
Oh, wow.

242
0:13:20.640 --> 0:13:24.640
I think we're getting a little tired.

243
0:13:24.640 --> 0:13:30.640
George, yours is free software.

244
0:13:30.640 --> 0:13:33.640
Just sing the song.

245
0:13:33.640 --> 0:13:43.640
Apparently there's a song about free software, which I had never heard, and I'm hoping maybe someone will sing to me at some point.

246
0:13:43.640 --> 0:13:52.640
But this way of developing software is based on the idea that everybody has a right to modify the software that they're using,

247
0:13:52.640 --> 0:13:59.640
which I've always thought is kind of a strange thing to say it's a right, that it's wrong somehow to withhold software from somebody.

248
0:13:59.640 --> 0:14:07.640
But I do believe that it is a better way to start making software, and we wouldn't be here at this conference if we didn't all believe that.

249
0:14:07.640 --> 0:14:12.640
And now I'm trying to think of something else to say, and I'm hoping someone will beat me off or something, maybe.

250
0:14:12.640 --> 0:14:16.640
No, but it's the song.

251
0:14:16.640 --> 0:14:18.640
I think it goes something like this.

252
0:14:18.640 --> 0:14:28.640
I asked Chat GPT to write me a free software song.

253
0:14:28.640 --> 0:14:31.640
So without free software, I guess I wouldn't have a job.

254
0:14:31.640 --> 0:14:37.640
So obviously I'm glad I got to meet a lot of cool people, made good friends.

255
0:14:37.640 --> 0:14:46.640
So back to you, Don.

256
0:14:46.640 --> 0:14:52.640
I will not give you any other food-related topics.

257
0:14:52.640 --> 0:14:56.640
How about FOSDEM?

258
0:14:56.640 --> 0:15:00.640
I have a love-hate relationship with FOSDEM.

259
0:15:00.640 --> 0:15:03.640
I come here every year.

260
0:15:03.640 --> 0:15:13.640
On the one hand, we have the crowds, which is on the less of things that I like about this particular event.

261
0:15:13.640 --> 0:15:17.640
On the other hand, it's the place where everyone I know finally comes together.

262
0:15:17.640 --> 0:15:20.640
So I go to lots of different conferences.

263
0:15:20.640 --> 0:15:25.640
But this is the place where the whole community is in one place.

264
0:15:25.640 --> 0:15:32.640
And we have a community dev room, and Leslie always makes me delicious vegan cake for while we're here.

265
0:15:32.640 --> 0:15:33.640
And it's a lot of fun.

266
0:15:33.640 --> 0:15:34.640
I get to see people.

267
0:15:34.640 --> 0:15:41.640
There are lots of really good places to eat in Brussels, so I don't drink the beer, as discussed earlier.

268
0:15:41.640 --> 0:15:46.640
But there are two really good Ethiopian restaurants and an African tapas restaurant,

269
0:15:46.640 --> 0:15:52.640
all of which are high on my list of delicious places to eat in Brussels while I'm here at this event.

270
0:15:52.640 --> 0:16:01.640
And I spend a lot of my time at fringe parts of the conference, so ChaosCon on Friday was a lot of fun.

271
0:16:01.640 --> 0:16:04.640
And I like to go out to dinner.

272
0:16:04.640 --> 0:16:10.640
Oh, good.

273
0:16:10.640 --> 0:16:13.640
Spot.

274
0:16:13.640 --> 0:16:19.640
Bob Dylan.

275
0:16:19.640 --> 0:16:20.640
No one wants me to sing.

276
0:16:20.640 --> 0:16:21.640
I promise you this.

277
0:16:21.640 --> 0:16:24.640
I can give you 150 reasons why.

278
0:16:24.640 --> 0:16:29.640
The first reason is that I actually can do a really good impression, and no one needs to hear it.

279
0:16:29.640 --> 0:16:33.640
But if I have more of that beer that I was talking about previously, it might come out.

280
0:16:33.640 --> 0:16:38.640
And I apologize in advance because...

281
0:16:38.640 --> 0:16:42.640
It's not.

282
0:16:42.640 --> 0:16:46.640
I know a lot of people are a huge fan of the artists.

283
0:16:46.640 --> 0:16:50.640
I don't happen to be one of them, but obviously I have a lot of respect.

284
0:16:50.640 --> 0:17:02.640
Cultural icon, epic performer from what I've seen and heard, and a lot of followers.

285
0:17:02.640 --> 0:17:05.640
No one's people...

286
0:17:05.640 --> 0:17:10.640
No one wants a part of this.

287
0:17:10.640 --> 0:17:20.640
So fun fact, I was raised by hippies, so there was a fair amount of this artist playing around the home because they liked sort of that folksy guitar.

288
0:17:20.640 --> 0:17:25.640
Oh, good.

289
0:17:25.640 --> 0:17:29.640
So Dawn and Ray are tied, points-wise.

290
0:17:29.640 --> 0:17:30.640
Followed up.

291
0:17:30.640 --> 0:17:33.640
And so Spot and George.

292
0:17:33.640 --> 0:17:36.640
Tied for a laugh.

293
0:17:36.640 --> 0:17:40.640
Bob, open topic. Go ahead.

294
0:17:40.640 --> 0:17:44.640
I didn't hear the free software song.

295
0:17:44.640 --> 0:17:47.640
Is there a free software song? I haven't heard it.

296
0:17:47.640 --> 0:17:52.640
I don't know if it's just made up or maybe there should be one.

297
0:17:52.640 --> 0:17:58.640
And maybe it should be...somebody should start a GitHub repo for free open source software song.

298
0:17:58.640 --> 0:18:02.640
And maybe somebody can compose it. We can contribute to it.

299
0:18:02.640 --> 0:18:05.640
Make it a medley.

300
0:18:05.640 --> 0:18:09.640
And what kind of license should it be under if there is a song?

301
0:18:09.640 --> 0:18:13.640
I don't know if there is a license even for songs, but maybe somebody knows.

302
0:18:13.640 --> 0:18:19.640
But maybe there should even be a legal aspect.

303
0:18:19.640 --> 0:18:23.640
I know a lot of repetition of the word song.

304
0:18:23.640 --> 0:18:30.640
I don't know if we have one. There was that SUSE Chameleon one a while ago where they dressed up and there was a video and everything.

305
0:18:30.640 --> 0:18:34.640
And it was based on what does the fox say, I think.

306
0:18:34.640 --> 0:18:39.640
So there is that melody floating around.

307
0:18:39.640 --> 0:18:44.640
But I also don't know of a particular musical number.

308
0:18:44.640 --> 0:18:46.640
Oh, sorry. Is that pausing?

309
0:18:46.640 --> 0:18:51.640
What's that pausing? Okay.

310
0:18:51.640 --> 0:19:00.640
What kind of would this be? Would it be like those communist ditties that they...

311
0:19:00.640 --> 0:19:08.640
Alright, George, since you're holding the mic anyway, freets. Like fives.

312
0:19:08.640 --> 0:19:22.640
Fence. Fives. Otherwise...

313
0:19:22.640 --> 0:19:28.640
So freets are made from potatoes and they are fried.

314
0:19:28.640 --> 0:19:32.640
And I'm not sure if they were invented in France.

315
0:19:32.640 --> 0:19:40.640
But I do remember that one time I was driving, I'm from the US, I was driving across the country from Michigan to Oregon.

316
0:19:40.640 --> 0:19:49.640
And I stopped at a place in the middle of Wyoming and looked at the menu and on the menu they had freedom fries.

317
0:19:49.640 --> 0:19:52.640
They said menu twice.

318
0:19:52.640 --> 0:19:56.640
Well, you never know what the story was.

319
0:19:56.640 --> 0:20:03.640
But I get a good point about whoever invented the food. I mean, I always wonder the same thing.

320
0:20:03.640 --> 0:20:07.640
Whichever civilization first invented this...

321
0:20:07.640 --> 0:20:13.640
Now I'm from the South.

322
0:20:13.640 --> 0:20:16.640
That was a good win.

323
0:20:16.640 --> 0:20:18.640
Alright, mic goes back to Dahon.

324
0:20:18.640 --> 0:20:22.640
The topic is open source.

325
0:20:22.640 --> 0:20:30.640
I have made a career out of the stock technology and have been working in it for more than 20 years.

326
0:20:30.640 --> 0:20:37.640
So it's been a really, really long time. I really like it. Big companies just pay me to do this.

327
0:20:37.640 --> 0:20:41.640
So I get to hang out with really cool, fun people.

328
0:20:41.640 --> 0:20:48.640
I get to travel the world and go to conferences and give talks and hang out at places like this.

329
0:20:48.640 --> 0:20:57.640
And I get to work on software that anybody can see. It's fun. The people are fantastic.

330
0:20:57.640 --> 0:21:00.640
It's an amazing community.

331
0:21:00.640 --> 0:21:08.640
I get to come to this dev room every year at this event. I get to go to other events.

332
0:21:08.640 --> 0:21:11.640
I don't understand what the big deal about open source is.

333
0:21:11.640 --> 0:21:16.640
I mean, I went to the doctor and my doctor was very clear that this was not something that I should keep having.

334
0:21:16.640 --> 0:21:27.640
And I really ought to use the cream to just clear it up.

335
0:21:27.640 --> 0:21:32.640
So it's holding the mic anyway. Penguins.

336
0:21:32.640 --> 0:21:36.640
A penguin bit me once and it made me want to go and write code.

337
0:21:36.640 --> 0:21:39.640
And I don't know why that is, but I think it might have been sick.

338
0:21:39.640 --> 0:21:47.640
And I'm not an expert in animal diseases in any real sense, but I don't that doesn't seem like it makes any real logical progression.

339
0:21:47.640 --> 0:21:54.640
How would that animal infect me with the desire to be at my keyboard?

340
0:21:54.640 --> 0:21:58.640
But I really I need to spend less time at the zoo.

341
0:21:58.640 --> 0:22:06.640
And if I was able to, you know, be in other places, maybe a museum, maybe a bookstore, possibly a restaurant,

342
0:22:06.640 --> 0:22:11.640
there would be less risk of being attacked by a feral creature.

343
0:22:11.640 --> 0:22:14.640
I find myself in these situations far too often.

344
0:22:14.640 --> 0:22:21.640
And I think that my life choices are generally poor and I really regret so many things that I have done.

345
0:22:21.640 --> 0:22:23.640
And this is becoming a confessional.

346
0:22:23.640 --> 0:22:35.640
And I hope that you all can appreciate that I'm bearing my soul to you right now, all because of a black and white thing and its tendencies.

347
0:22:35.640 --> 0:22:42.640
All right. We're getting closer to the end.

348
0:22:42.640 --> 0:22:48.640
Don and Ray still tied, spot catching up with one point behind Don and Ray.

349
0:22:48.640 --> 0:22:52.640
So once we get to George, we'll do one last round.

350
0:22:52.640 --> 0:22:56.640
Oops, did we drop a.

351
0:22:56.640 --> 0:22:59.640
That's good that I have no idea how the points are scored.

352
0:22:59.640 --> 0:23:05.640
Every time you test someone challenges somebody else and they get the challenge and they finish the time.

353
0:23:05.640 --> 0:23:10.640
It's one point if you get your if you do the full minute like you have, you get two points.

354
0:23:10.640 --> 0:23:13.640
Yeah. All right.

355
0:23:13.640 --> 0:23:16.640
Community building community building.

356
0:23:16.640 --> 0:23:22.640
So I've been in this since 2014 when I started.

357
0:23:22.640 --> 0:23:27.640
I think there was a lot of discussion about why does this job need to even exist.

358
0:23:27.640 --> 0:23:30.640
People didn't understand what the value was.

359
0:23:30.640 --> 0:23:33.640
And I think that's obviously changed.

360
0:23:33.640 --> 0:23:37.640
I don't have to justify my existence anymore like I used to.

361
0:23:37.640 --> 0:23:43.640
But now the challenge is like where in the organization does it belong.

362
0:23:43.640 --> 0:23:47.640
It's like existential question.

363
0:23:47.640 --> 0:23:54.640
I think the contribution to the company and the bottom line is pretty clear.

364
0:23:54.640 --> 0:24:00.640
But people don't know like who my boss should be.

365
0:24:00.640 --> 0:24:02.640
What the what the metrics should be.

366
0:24:02.640 --> 0:24:09.640
But like everything else I think it's just constantly evolving and hopefully we'll continue to grow.

367
0:24:09.640 --> 0:24:18.640
It's nice to see like a dev rooms like this that are very popular and people want to talk about him and discuss him and debate him.

368
0:24:18.640 --> 0:24:22.640
Wow.

369
0:24:22.640 --> 0:24:27.640
I think I said that.

370
0:24:27.640 --> 0:24:34.640
All right. Does anyone have a topic suggestion for George.

371
0:24:34.640 --> 0:24:37.640
Okay.

372
0:24:37.640 --> 0:24:44.640
All right. The cloud.

373
0:24:44.640 --> 0:24:49.640
The cloud is a very fuzzy concept that was invented.

374
0:24:49.640 --> 0:25:05.640
It was first described my understanding was in 2006 with Amazon Web servers using Zen which was the first open source virtual hypervisor which was available for them to use.

375
0:25:05.640 --> 0:25:18.640
And it spread from there and it spread from computing to data and storing data on someone else's hard drive instead of using someone else's computer.

376
0:25:18.640 --> 0:25:34.640
And then to cloud documents like Google Docs and then everyone thought that software as a service was a great thing and a way to lock people in and prevented free software.

377
0:25:34.640 --> 0:25:39.640
So now you can't modify the software that you're using.

378
0:25:39.640 --> 0:25:50.640
All right. Last round.

379
0:25:50.640 --> 0:25:55.640
Don your topic is traveling by plane.

380
0:25:55.640 --> 0:26:01.640
Traveling by plane. This is one of one of my favorite things to do.

381
0:26:01.640 --> 0:26:04.640
I actually probably prefer traveling by train.

382
0:26:04.640 --> 0:26:14.640
But sadly so I live in the UK. We have lots of rail transportation but I can't get back to see my family.

383
0:26:14.640 --> 0:26:21.640
I can't get back to the U.S. where a lot of the cool conferences are without traveling by air.

384
0:26:21.640 --> 0:26:33.640
So I fly Delta a lot which is nice because I have status and so I get extra things I get to sit in the lounge and drink free champagne which is pretty cool.

385
0:26:33.640 --> 0:26:50.640
And I spend a lot of my time in these these little tubes where I still wear a mask because they are just gigantic germ factories with people breathing all over each other for 10 hours straight.

386
0:26:50.640 --> 0:27:02.640
The food is terrible. But on those international ones they give you.

387
0:27:02.640 --> 0:27:11.640
OK. Spot crabs.

388
0:27:11.640 --> 0:27:15.640
Well my doctor. No I'm not going to do that.

389
0:27:15.640 --> 0:27:21.640
Recently I was in the position of having a lot of money at my disposal.

390
0:27:21.640 --> 0:27:24.640
And of course the first thing that came to my mind was crabs.

391
0:27:24.640 --> 0:27:32.640
So I went on a quest to find a vendor who would be able to take a design that I had found on the Internet that was very popular.

392
0:27:32.640 --> 0:27:38.640
It was very orange and pinchy. And I said to them can you make a lot of these.

393
0:27:38.640 --> 0:27:45.640
And then they responded. Who is this. And I said it does not matter. I have money. Just do it.

394
0:27:45.640 --> 0:27:51.640
And they did. And a year later these boxes started to show up in the warehouse and they were full of plushy goodness.

395
0:27:51.640 --> 0:27:56.640
The kind that makes you think am I at a seafood restaurant by mistake but you're not.

396
0:27:56.640 --> 0:28:09.640
You're in this place where there's shelves and inside the plastic wrap its little eyes look at you and you can't help but feel abject terror because you know that this should not exist.

397
0:28:09.640 --> 0:28:18.640
And you have done something that is against the laws of nature.

398
0:28:18.640 --> 0:28:25.640
All right.

399
0:28:25.640 --> 0:28:30.640
And get up.

400
0:28:30.640 --> 0:28:33.640
So what a lot of things to say about this.

401
0:28:33.640 --> 0:28:39.640
I've been using it for the past two years and before that I worked at a competing platform get lab.

402
0:28:39.640 --> 0:28:45.640
So it took me a long time to get used to the new like interface.

403
0:28:45.640 --> 0:28:58.640
And I struggle quite a bit with it. But now I guess you know after two years it's it's I can't even tell the difference between the two platforms.

404
0:28:58.640 --> 0:29:06.640
It's kind of ironic. A lot of open source software are hosted on this on this on this platform but the platform itself is not open source.

405
0:29:06.640 --> 0:29:10.640
So the irony continues.

406
0:29:10.640 --> 0:29:38.640
But you know I'm not a really I'm not a I don't get religious about a lot of things including like whether it's something should be freely available with source code or not because I use a I use a lot of Apple products and they're obviously not open source.

407
0:29:38.640 --> 0:29:54.640
Well that kind of concludes unless you want to keep going. People need to like start throwing some topics at our panelists. If not our winner today is Dawn followed very closely by Ray and Scott who caught up.

408
0:29:54.640 --> 0:29:57.640
Oh sorry. Sorry George. So yep.

409
0:29:57.640 --> 0:30:07.640
One more. You're right you're right you're right. Absolutely. On the topic of that how about lunch. Not us going to lunch which we could but topic is lunch.

410
0:30:07.640 --> 0:30:12.640
Yesterday for lunch at Fos

411
0:30:12.640 --> 0:30:23.640
Dem. I knew that there would be long queues and so I went to the grocery store and bought some food ahead of time.

412
0:30:23.640 --> 0:30:39.640
And that was very lovely. I when I became hungry I went outside and I opened my bag and I opened the packages and I consumed what was inside the packages and I didn't.

413
0:30:39.640 --> 0:30:53.640
Well where I come from there's this thing that we do when we're hungry and it's important that you get the deep fryer out to start with because if he ain't gonna burn your neighborhood down you're doing it wrong.

414
0:30:53.640 --> 0:31:04.640
So what you've got to do is you've got to put the oil in and then you find the food and then you put the food in and then you.

415
0:31:04.640 --> 0:31:16.640
However I was unable to go to the establishment that that sold nourishment.

416
0:31:16.640 --> 0:31:20.640
Well done George.

417
0:31:20.640 --> 0:31:31.640
Well thank you all for playing along. We thought we'd try something different this year. We'll see how if we do this again next year but Dawn's still the winner.

418
0:31:31.640 --> 0:31:45.640
Tied by Spot and Ray. I did. I did buy a prize for each of you however yours isn't vegan. So I'll have to get you something or there's more cake.

419
0:31:45.640 --> 0:32:03.640
Otherwise thank you for playing along. I know that we ended a bit early but maybe.
