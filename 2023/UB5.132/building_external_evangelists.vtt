WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.520
Okay, and now is the part where we promise you Matt.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.520
Go Matt.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.240
All righty, thank you everybody.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
Thank you.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.520
And Flor, you know, we're starting to warm up the crowd for you.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.240
You know, Flor was, said I was the opening act here, so I'm really, you know, glad to

00:20.240 --> 00:23.560
be able to introduce the rest of the, you know, the folks today.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.520
But I wanted to talk to you about something that is really critical.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.160
It's building external evangelists.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.800
How many people are here in DevRel?

00:30.800 --> 00:31.800
A few, okay.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
Oh yeah, good number.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.400
Community, just, you know, general.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.600
Okay, all right, well, yeah, DevRel community.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.160
It's kind of, it kind of overlapped now, don't they?

00:40.160 --> 00:41.560
So who am I?

00:41.560 --> 00:42.560
This is me.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.880
That's me over there, yes.

00:43.880 --> 00:48.160
So I am the head of open source strategy, or the Haas for short, if you want to call

00:48.160 --> 00:50.120
me the Haas, I can answer to that.

00:50.120 --> 00:55.880
You can find me everywhere on socials if you want to connect after the fact.

00:55.880 --> 01:02.000
I work for SCARF, if you're not familiar with SCARF, we do advanced metrics to track adoption

01:02.000 --> 01:04.240
and growth of open source projects.

01:04.240 --> 01:07.840
And we also have the Hacking Open Source Business Podcast.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.360
So if you're interested in being a guest or checking it out, appreciate it.

01:11.360 --> 01:16.000
So one of the questions that I get asked a lot, and I talk with founders, I talk with

01:16.000 --> 01:19.680
executives quite a bit, I get this question asked all the time.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.560
How do you measure community or DevRel?

01:21.560 --> 01:24.920
Has anybody gotten that question in the, you know, the space?

01:24.920 --> 01:26.480
In the last five minutes.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.440
In the last five minutes, just yesterday, right?

01:29.440 --> 01:34.640
Executives have a hard time figuring out, you know, what this is.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.840
And my answer generally to them is you measure the external advocates or evangelists you

01:39.840 --> 01:41.560
create, okay?

01:41.560 --> 01:45.120
There's a lot of other metrics you can track, but this is the one that I typically go to

01:45.120 --> 01:47.040
more often than not.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.360
And you might be asking the question why, and so I'm going to answer that question in

01:50.360 --> 01:52.080
348 slides.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.960
I think I have till noon today, so I should be going for a while here.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
That's cool.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.240
But my first question on the Y is what is the company expecting from these activities?

02:03.240 --> 02:07.560
So when you're talking about community DevRel, what's the com- what are you expecting?

02:07.560 --> 02:10.640
You know, so anybody want to shout out what you're expecting?

02:10.640 --> 02:11.640
No?

02:11.640 --> 02:12.640
Okay, I'll just go.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.360
I'll tell you what most people are expecting.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.400
They're expecting more contributors or more users or more customers.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.280
What's funny is every company that I talk to, they might fit into one of these, but

02:23.280 --> 02:25.560
they want all of them, right?

02:25.560 --> 02:29.200
So if they're like, oh, we want more contributors, well, really, what do you want?

02:29.200 --> 02:32.160
Well, we want more people to use our stuff, and if we think we have more contributors,

02:32.160 --> 02:35.840
we'll have better software, and then if we have more users, we'll have better, you know,

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
customers, right?

02:36.840 --> 02:41.160
So this more is something that people are striving for.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.920
So no matter what, people are looking for more.

02:44.920 --> 02:49.720
So I have to put on my other hat because those who are DevRel in the community space, I got

02:49.720 --> 02:53.640
to go a little sales marketing business-y, so I got to switch hats.

02:53.640 --> 02:58.560
I got to put on my sales hat, which is the supervillain hat, so I can talk a little bit

02:58.560 --> 03:02.680
about other things other than community activities.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.760
So most companies are looking for more dollars, okay?

03:07.760 --> 03:13.720
Whether you're looking for more contributors or more users or more customers, at the board

03:13.720 --> 03:18.360
level, at the executive level, ultimately they're thinking dollars and cents.

03:18.360 --> 03:24.760
And it gets back to a hypothesis, right, which is the more users in the community, the bigger

03:24.760 --> 03:30.040
the community we have, the more potential customers we have in the future, right?

03:30.040 --> 03:33.760
Have you ever seen the product growth flywheel before?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.200
It's kind of overdone.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.560
This is my really crappy interpretation of trying to redo it, so if anybody wants to

03:38.560 --> 03:44.520
redo it in a prettier graphic, you know, you can see that.

03:44.520 --> 03:50.400
But the idea is the more people who come in, find your software, try it, start to use it,

03:50.400 --> 03:54.240
start to be part of the community, the more willing they are to either tell other people

03:54.240 --> 03:59.600
about it or potentially purchase something for you.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.840
And this is where you get a huge disconnect, right?

04:02.840 --> 04:09.440
So you have the community dev rel team here who is trying to be very focused on the relationships

04:09.440 --> 04:11.440
that you have with your community.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.440
You're trying to track the community growth, and you're not necessarily thinking about

04:16.440 --> 04:21.760
the number of customers, ARR, MRR, but when you get to the board room, a lot of times

04:21.760 --> 04:27.780
those are the metrics that they're looking at, whereas we're talking about these metrics.

04:27.780 --> 04:32.240
And so there's a disconnect, and we need to link those two somehow.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.000
And early on, a lot of these are talked about quite frequently in smaller companies, but

04:37.000 --> 04:42.640
as you get bigger, everything tends to shift to this side, and when you're saying, oh,

04:42.640 --> 04:47.160
how many of the number of customers or the ARR can we attribute back to this side, it

04:47.160 --> 04:49.680
becomes kind of squishy, right?

04:49.680 --> 04:54.240
And that becomes a difficult proposition for a lot of folks.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.200
And this is where we've seen the rise of the quote-unquote influencer marketing, or dev

04:59.200 --> 05:03.360
rel in our space, but influencer marketing has been around for a while.

05:03.360 --> 05:08.240
Maybe you've seen some of the documentaries, or you've seen some people out there on Instagram

05:08.240 --> 05:12.200
who are like, look, I have free trips, and I get to go to all these places.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.720
Hey, I get free trips to go to these places too, and stand in front of you awesome people,

05:15.720 --> 05:19.200
so I'm kind of an influencer, right?

05:19.200 --> 05:22.060
But this is trust, right?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.920
It's all based on trust.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.680
So when you see somebody, whether it's online, whether it's part of some other community,

05:29.680 --> 05:33.920
you start to get to know them, and you start to trust what they say, and when they tell

05:33.920 --> 05:39.160
you to buy a product or do something else, hey, that's something that you listen to.

05:39.160 --> 05:45.320
And that has been established in not just the software space, but also in the overall

05:45.320 --> 05:48.360
kind of retail and consumer space as well.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.640
And as tech evangelists, we are all part of that, even if we don't want to consider ourselves,

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
we are.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.640
We are all part of our influencers.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.600
Our job is to go out there, talk to people, and get them to understand what we're trying

05:59.600 --> 06:06.720
to preach to them, tell them, share our experiences, help them get better.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.840
But there's a difference between internal and external evangelists, right?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.640
So let me give you this example.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.080
We've got two people here, right?

06:14.080 --> 06:19.880
The first person works for Delta Company, let's say, and they do development JavaScript,

06:19.880 --> 06:23.440
and they say Delta Software is awesome.

06:23.440 --> 06:29.200
The B works for a website that uses Delta Software, and they say Delta Software is awesome.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.840
Who are you more likely to believe when they say that?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.360
You're going to believe B. Why?

06:35.360 --> 06:40.720
Well, this person over here is incented to tell you that Delta Software is awesome.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.640
So if I come up here and I work for Scarf and I tell you, Scarf's stuff is awesome,

06:44.640 --> 06:46.840
you'll be like, oh, okay, that's cool.

06:46.840 --> 06:51.160
But if someone else comes along and says Scarf's software is awesome, you're more likely to

06:51.160 --> 06:53.080
listen.

06:53.080 --> 06:58.400
And that's why building these external evangelists is critically important.

06:58.400 --> 07:04.840
And from a business perspective, this is how the business side thinks of this.

07:04.840 --> 07:10.120
Someone out in this space tells you, this is great, this is awesome.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.160
Their followers, some of these blue people here, they're like, oh, yeah, that sounds

07:14.160 --> 07:15.160
pretty cool.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.360
Let me go ahead and let me watch this thing that you're doing or attend a conference

07:19.360 --> 07:20.640
or listen in.

07:20.640 --> 07:26.000
And so those people watch and then some subset of those will say, oh, I really want to try

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
that out.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.520
And so then they try it out.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.720
And of those who try it out, maybe a couple will actually adopt it.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.160
They'll maybe become customers.

07:35.160 --> 07:40.680
And that funnel, that process is what is expected from the business side.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.920
And that's what the investment in the DevRel space is all about when it comes to the executive

07:45.920 --> 07:48.040
side of things.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.420
But the thing is, can this scale?

07:50.420 --> 07:56.040
Well, if there is one me, so I can go to one conference at a time.

07:56.040 --> 08:00.760
If we hire another me or another me, we can do this as well.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.880
But that gets really expensive.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.280
And a lot of companies, especially in the younger stages, are a little scrap.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.840
So they might have one, two, three DevRels maybe.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.940
And so how do you scale that?

08:13.940 --> 08:20.680
And that comes into thinking about this in terms of different tribes or different communities.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.160
There are lots of different programming languages.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.840
And it's not feasible for one person to understand all the different tech ecosystems, all the

08:28.840 --> 08:31.880
different tribes, all the different communities that are out there.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.800
They're all very different.

08:33.800 --> 08:38.880
And so by plugging into that and finding people who might be able to plug into those external

08:38.880 --> 08:45.000
communities, those external tribes, you can actually do this play where you're talking

08:45.000 --> 08:48.880
to people and getting them to try over and over again in multiple communities that you

08:48.880 --> 08:52.960
might not be part of or might not be able to reach.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.960
So how do you get external evangelists?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.320
There's a few different ways.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.960
This is not an exhaustive measure by any means.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.840
It's going to be the 15-minute version, which is the time we've got left.

09:04.840 --> 09:13.480
But let me start with should you hire influencers or DevRel people or external people to kind

09:13.480 --> 09:15.400
of come in and do something for you.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.680
There's a lot of people who have a really high GitHub rating.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.920
They have a lot of YouTube subscribers.

09:20.920 --> 09:21.920
These are great people.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.280
But your results are going to vary because their communities might not match what you're

09:25.280 --> 09:26.480
trying to do.

09:26.480 --> 09:31.480
And so I've done this in the past at previous jobs where you partner with someone and generally

09:31.480 --> 09:32.480
it's a paid relationship.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.880
And you're like, hey, could you cover this event?

09:34.880 --> 09:35.880
Could you come talk?

09:35.880 --> 09:36.880
Could you do these things?

09:36.880 --> 09:39.520
And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

09:39.520 --> 09:44.600
It's a very costly way of doing it, but it can be effective if you do it right.

09:44.600 --> 09:49.400
So the classic play is obviously grow your user base.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.400
That's easy, right?

09:50.400 --> 09:51.400
So, OK, we're done.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
Just grow your user base.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
You're done.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.880
It goes a little bit beyond that.

09:55.880 --> 10:01.600
So when we talk about growing the user base, this is where you look at the graph here.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.920
You start with users and there's different pathways for those users, but everyone has

10:05.920 --> 10:07.760
to start as a user.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.560
It could go into the dev side where they want to be code contributors and eventually become

10:11.560 --> 10:13.800
maintainers or part of the core teams.

10:13.800 --> 10:20.360
Or it could be that they become content contributors, someone who does blogs, someone who does talks

10:20.360 --> 10:24.720
at conferences and then eventually turning into a regular evangelist who continually

10:24.720 --> 10:26.480
does that.

10:26.480 --> 10:31.600
Now what's interesting is a lot of folks, especially in the community, a lot of our metrics

10:31.600 --> 10:34.000
are based on this top, which is great.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.200
But a lot of this bottom is not necessarily looked at or followed as closely.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.280
And there isn't as flushed out a metric set for these.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.160
So how can you get more users?

10:45.160 --> 10:46.920
There's a lot of different ways, right?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.960
So content, content, content.

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960
Content machines.

10:50.960 --> 10:57.240
You know, I do a lot of blogs, podcasts, videos, all kinds of different stuff.

10:57.240 --> 11:01.400
That helps people, especially if it's geared towards making it easier for them to get into

11:01.400 --> 11:02.440
the community.

11:02.440 --> 11:07.080
So education, training, code examples, conference talks, things like that.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.000
But also there's a product space here, right?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.600
Features that matter.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
That's important.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.480
So it is a collaborative effort with product in a lot of cases.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
You have to get that.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.880
You have to make it easier for people to get started.

11:19.880 --> 11:24.800
And then you have to figure out how to get more people to tell how awesome your product

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
is.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.600
That's that external evangelist side, right?

11:27.600 --> 11:31.060
Because again, if I tell you we're awesome, it's okay.

11:31.060 --> 11:35.360
But if someone else who you trust in the community does, there's nothing to do with us, that's

11:35.360 --> 11:38.200
even better.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.960
And you have to set those expectations, right?

11:41.960 --> 11:47.560
And this is a classic problem that I see happen over and over again in the startup space,

11:47.560 --> 11:54.080
the William Dev Rowan community, is you start to compare people to other people.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.560
Not all communities are the same, and you have to identify that.

11:57.560 --> 12:02.480
So if you're part of, let's say, the Haskell community, and you're going to compare with

12:02.480 --> 12:06.880
JavaScript, those are two vastly different sized communities.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.520
And if you're coming from the JavaScript community and you're saying, like, look at all these

12:10.520 --> 12:14.320
people in my conference talk, I've got a full room, I've got 200 people, you go to the Haskell

12:14.320 --> 12:20.360
and it's got 30, you can't be like, oh, I only got 30 people at my talk.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.640
Because that's not what it's about, because the Haskell programming language just has

12:24.640 --> 12:26.520
a smaller community.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.520
And that's okay.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.200
And when I'm a database guy, and when you look at databases, for instance, I built this

12:32.200 --> 12:34.880
chart, it's really hard to read, but you can get the slides after.

12:34.880 --> 12:40.680
But the gist of this is you start off and you think, wow, how many people use databases?

12:40.680 --> 12:41.760
Everybody uses a database.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.920
So what's your total market size?

12:44.920 --> 12:46.840
How many people can we get to use our stuff?

12:46.840 --> 12:51.200
Oh, there's billions and billions of people who are going to care about what I want to

12:51.200 --> 12:52.200
say.

12:52.200 --> 12:57.160
Well, when you start talking about operationally sides of things, you're like, huh, okay, well,

12:57.160 --> 13:01.160
from a developer perspective, let's be honest, for a moment developers don't care about databases.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.720
So half of all developers go out the window.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.680
And then you're like, hmm, well, maybe full stack ones, I guess, care about it.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.240
But architects do.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.600
And then you're like, oh, well, what about operations people?

13:12.600 --> 13:13.600
Well, DBAs do.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
Do sysadmins?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
No.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.200
So you have to start to pare down and figure out what that audience is.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.400
And don't get discouraged if you're working in a space where the audience is small and

13:23.400 --> 13:24.960
you have to grow it.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.360
That's something that I see happen quite often in a lot of executives and companies.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.600
They're like, oh, that guy got 10,000 views on his video.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Why can't you do that?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
He's like, because I'm not them.

13:34.600 --> 13:42.280
I had an interview with a guy from Google on a podcast that I did, and he's in the database

13:42.280 --> 13:43.280
space.

13:43.280 --> 13:48.960
It's like, the Google guys just don't get it because our Google videos on G Cloud, they're

13:48.960 --> 13:53.760
like 500,000 views, and the database ones are like 5,000.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.480
And they're constantly harassing me.

13:55.480 --> 13:59.320
You're not doing enough because you're not getting the 500,000 views.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.760
Well, the community's smaller.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.840
It's different.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.400
And that's okay.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.920
So avoid some common mistakes, right?

14:09.920 --> 14:13.560
Don't assume that your audience is as large as others.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.540
And don't assume that just because you're speaking will automatically generate interest.

14:17.540 --> 14:20.160
It requires a lot of work.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.320
And product awesomeness trumps story.

14:23.320 --> 14:27.960
You can have the best storytellers, the best DevRel folks out there, and if they're talking

14:27.960 --> 14:31.620
to people about a crappy product, it just doesn't work.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.800
So some best practices.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
Be authentic, okay?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.000
This is really important.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.080
You want to connect with people.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.840
You have to be authentic in your conversations.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.800
If you are authentic, people will come to you, and you have to make connections.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.280
How many people like dogs?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.840
Okay.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
Half of you.

14:50.840 --> 14:51.840
So you know what?

14:51.840 --> 14:52.840
This is my dog.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.480
And you know what's awesome about dogs?

14:54.480 --> 14:57.440
You can be an introvert, all right?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.880
And if you're walking around, no one else in the neighborhood, if you have a dog on

15:00.880 --> 15:03.920
a leash, they will stop by and talk to you.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.920
Why?

15:04.920 --> 15:06.600
Because dogs are cute.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.240
But they also have dogs, especially if you have two dog people.

15:09.240 --> 15:14.160
I've met so many people just from the dog, you know, that it's not funny.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.440
It's a connection that you make.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.920
So how do you find those connections in the community?

15:19.920 --> 15:24.960
Because the more of these types of connections, the more people that you can get to potentially

15:24.960 --> 15:28.680
help within the project and potentially talk about your stuff.

15:28.680 --> 15:33.280
You also need to make this really accessible.

15:33.280 --> 15:38.400
People often develop brilliant things that are too complicated.

15:38.400 --> 15:48.160
We also have maintainers and devs who think that everyone thinks like themselves.

15:48.160 --> 15:52.760
If you are comfortable on the command line and you are comfortable setting up something

15:52.760 --> 15:58.960
following a 142-step process, don't assume that other people do that, right?

15:58.960 --> 16:01.600
Not everyone thinks that way.

16:01.600 --> 16:06.320
And also make it accessible for how new users get involved.

16:06.320 --> 16:10.520
Be safe in a fun environment, right?

16:10.520 --> 16:15.440
Nobody likes to come and listen to the person who talks in the monotone voice and who says

16:15.440 --> 16:18.120
this is a really boring talk and a boring community.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.080
You want to make things fun and engaging for people, right?

16:21.080 --> 16:24.080
You want to connect with folks as much as you can.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.200
Avoid toxic people because they suck.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.680
Avoid abrasive culture.

16:28.680 --> 16:34.320
What are you doing to engage with the community on a regular basis?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.520
What's the personality of your community?

16:36.520 --> 16:39.400
Does your community have a personality?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
It should.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
You should define that up front.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.960
You should figure out what you want people to know your community as.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.960
You also want to be transparent.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.040
Share what's happening internally.

16:51.040 --> 16:55.640
Sometimes, especially in an open source driven company when you have commercial open source,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.240
you have gotten different tiers, right?

16:58.240 --> 17:02.200
You have the tier of people who are in the company and they know everything that's going

17:02.200 --> 17:06.440
on and then you want all these contributors outside to just assume that they know what's

17:06.440 --> 17:08.640
going on internally or not know it.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.120
And setting up those silos is bad.

17:11.120 --> 17:15.320
So sharing plans, roadmaps, other things, super critical.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.560
Don't create that cast-based system, okay?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.960
Explain yourself and your decisions, right?

17:20.960 --> 17:25.280
When you say, I'm not going to take this feature, that's okay.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.280
You can do that as a maintainer.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.640
But if you don't explain why, then that really hurts people, right?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.200
And also be open to feedback.

17:35.200 --> 17:43.680
Now the next one is you really want to focus on getting help but you want to ask for it.

17:43.680 --> 17:48.280
I don't know why so many people are afraid to ask for help.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.280
This is a classic blunder.

17:50.280 --> 17:55.040
If you're running a community and you want to build contributors, maintainers, you want

17:55.040 --> 18:00.040
to build external evangelists, you have to tell people where to start.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.040
Classic.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.800
I've seen this several times where people are like, I really want to get involved in

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
this community.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.000
So they submit some patch and it's like, wow, this has nothing to do with what we want in

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
this project.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.720
So we just reject it and move on.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.000
And then that person moves away and they never want to come back.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.160
Well, why did they choose that?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.760
Well, they didn't know where else to start.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.880
Tell them where to start.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.240
Help them with that.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.120
And give that feedback.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.200
Be responsive.

18:24.200 --> 18:29.880
Nothing drives people more bad even not hearing from you when they ask you a question or submit

18:29.880 --> 18:31.960
something to a project.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.080
It's mind-willingly bad.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.480
So you're building relationships here.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.560
Treat each other like you want to be in a relationship with one another.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.560
You want to be part of this community.

18:44.560 --> 18:51.880
Avoid that silence, good, bad, and promote people's work.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.800
So if somebody submits a blog, somebody's had a conference talk, go ahead and promote

18:55.800 --> 18:56.800
it for them.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.360
Tell them that this is awesome.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.560
Give them feedback.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.120
Keep on rewarding people.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.160
People are rewarded by positive achievement.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.280
And that doesn't just mean baked goods.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.040
I do appreciate the baked goods though.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.960
But you give away challenge coins, Tom, right?

19:14.960 --> 19:17.640
Yep, so there you go.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.760
Lots of different things you can do.

19:19.760 --> 19:24.280
But one reward that's often overlooked is simple acknowledgment.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.040
I acknowledge that you contributed.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.120
Postgres does a great job of this.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.200
They give away challenge coins as well.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.800
But everyone who contributes, they're out in their read-me's and every time they do release

19:35.800 --> 19:37.400
notes.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.800
So make sure when they do release notes or blogs, you write profiles on people.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.840
Physical rewards, of course, work too.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.760
I like hats, but that's just me.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.160
But the other thing you can do is listen.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.800
Listening is critical to all of this.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.920
And really, just don't be an ass.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.880
People are out here to participate in the community.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.460
And they want to be part of this.

20:05.460 --> 20:12.200
And so the more that you can help them feel like they're part of it, that means that they're

20:12.200 --> 20:16.200
going to be wanting to stick around and help more.

20:16.200 --> 20:21.840
External evangelists aren't just participants, right?

20:21.840 --> 20:22.840
That's what you want.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.400
You want to have the external evangelists.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.240
You don't want people just in the community.

20:27.240 --> 20:31.720
You want to make sure that they can contribute and be happy to do so.

20:31.720 --> 20:37.640
So if you're interested in more, because I'm just about out of time, go ahead and follow

20:37.640 --> 20:39.560
along, get more details.

20:39.560 --> 20:44.800
We just released this new website, opensourcemetrics.org.

20:44.800 --> 20:53.400
And so I put all of the metrics that go between the community and the business and how to

20:53.400 --> 20:56.480
map out that entire funnel.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.560
And you can also see me later on today where I give the open source business guidebook

21:00.560 --> 21:06.840
over in Room K. Or if you're going to the state of OpenCon in the UK, I do have a talk

21:06.840 --> 21:07.560
on how to destroy a community, the Superf

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
Villains Guide.

21:08.560 --> 21:14.760
So if you really want to know how Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Voldemort would go about

21:14.760 --> 21:20.280
destroying an open source community, stop on by and see me.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.840
And again, that's where you can reach me.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.840
Thank you, Matt.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
Yes.

21:23.840 --> 21:33.400
Thank you very much, Matt, for that wonderful talk.

21:33.400 --> 21:37.440
I was actually just posting that anyone who's looking to get into a dev rel career, there's

21:37.440 --> 21:40.760
some really great information here about setting reasonable expectations with your company

21:40.760 --> 21:41.760
leadership.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.760
So very much appreciated.

21:42.760 --> 21:47.160
Matt, if you would take questions, we have a little time for questions.

21:47.160 --> 21:52.640
Now is the time to ask questions.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.640
Is it on now?

21:53.640 --> 21:54.640
Yes.

21:54.640 --> 21:55.640
Yes.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.640
No.

21:56.640 --> 21:57.640
Mike on.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.640
Mike on.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.640
Mike off.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.640
Okay.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.640
I can go.

22:01.640 --> 22:02.640
Hey, questions.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.640
Questions for people.

22:05.640 --> 22:11.080
Anybody have any questions?

22:11.080 --> 22:13.080
Anybody want to see me do stand-up comedy?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
Yes.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.080
Yes.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.080
Yes.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
Yes.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.080
I'm embarrassed.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.080
I can't do it.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
Question.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
Hold on a minute.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.080
Oh, no, no, no.

22:22.080 --> 22:33.120
I shall slowly walk through the audience.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.960
I really appreciated the advice to listen, to hear what people are saying so you can

22:36.960 --> 22:38.560
kind of bring them into their community.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.360
But how do you get people to create content about something?

22:43.360 --> 22:45.200
Do you reward them, encourage them?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.360
Is it just bragging rights?

22:46.360 --> 22:47.880
What's your approach?

22:47.880 --> 22:51.600
So I think that there's a couple of things that I've seen work effectively.

22:51.600 --> 22:59.040
I know there's a talk this afternoon on building non-code contributors, which is good.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.720
So I'd recommend that.

23:00.720 --> 23:07.000
But typically my approach has been to help people get involved, start to work with them,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.040
talk to them initially, especially a lot of people who are just getting started.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.960
They don't know what to write, especially when English isn't their first language and

23:13.960 --> 23:15.440
you're going to post in English.

23:15.440 --> 23:20.280
So working with someone, giving them ideas, I generally will start with a creative kind

23:20.280 --> 23:24.960
of idea board and do that help line where I'm looking for a topic on how to do X in

23:24.960 --> 23:29.200
Kubernetes or how to deploy this or how to tune this.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.040
And if they'll agree to take one, I'll work with them to release it, we'll promote it.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.040
So there is some of that reward.

23:35.040 --> 23:41.760
But I also go through and do monthly rewards for the top blog posts and contributors that

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
way.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.160
I'll look at yearly rewards for that as well.

23:46.160 --> 23:50.800
We've done things where given plaques out at conferences and stuff for someone who's

23:50.800 --> 23:55.400
had the most effective or interesting blog, had them come out to the conference, stand

23:55.400 --> 23:57.760
up on stage, give a talk, whatever.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.640
And that's a reward as well for them.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.920
But a lot of it is just building that relationship and working with them, especially as they're

24:03.920 --> 24:04.920
starting out.

24:04.920 --> 24:09.320
Because when you're starting out, you're really unsure and there's a lot of that imposter

24:09.320 --> 24:10.320
syndrome.

24:10.320 --> 24:14.400
You're like, I don't really know if this is good enough to publish.

24:14.400 --> 24:19.600
And the thing is, you just got to make it so easy for them to get started and feel like

24:19.600 --> 24:23.720
they're part of the community and feel like no matter what, you're there for them and

24:23.720 --> 24:27.200
you can help them through it.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.560
Flora has you.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
Oh, sorry.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
Thank you.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
Yes.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.600
My phone started to beep and my brain immediately turned off.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.600
Thank you, Flora.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.600
Hey, Matt.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
Thank you.

24:40.600 --> 24:46.280
So there's a couple of companies that have these community ambassador type programs.

24:46.280 --> 24:51.160
What in your experience or from your viewpoint are some good ones and why?

24:51.160 --> 24:56.000
So the community ambassador programs, you know, like GitHub has the GitHub stars program

24:56.000 --> 25:00.280
where they've got quite a few people who are on the GitHub side of things.

25:00.280 --> 25:04.160
Most of them end up being more on the code contributor side and they don't necessarily

25:04.160 --> 25:06.800
kind of embrace the bigger audiences.

25:06.800 --> 25:11.280
Even when you look at a lot of the tools that are out on community space, whether you're

25:11.280 --> 25:16.600
talking about orbits or common room, they're very focused on the contributor first and

25:16.600 --> 25:20.840
then a few extra things, but they don't necessarily do the full picture.

25:20.840 --> 25:25.400
And so I think that that's where if we want to continue to grow the community, it has

25:25.400 --> 25:30.880
to be in embracing all kinds of contributions, not just the code contributions.

25:30.880 --> 25:36.600
And so I think that that's where we need to kind of move to that next level.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.720
And when I was at Percona, we tried to build that program in, but it was still relatively

25:40.720 --> 25:42.120
young.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.960
So we were still working through the kinks.

25:43.960 --> 25:49.520
We went through one year on that program to do that, which worked pretty well, but I wouldn't

25:49.520 --> 25:52.640
say that it is the model for everything just yet.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.560
Thank you very much, Matt.

25:55.560 --> 25:58.080
I don't I say, oh, it is on.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.080
I love it.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.080
Thank you.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.840
Thank you very much for your talk for if you would come up, please and get set up.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.000
That would be lovely.

26:06.000 --> 26:15.560
While we are waiting for our next speaker to get slides ready, it is time for the standard

26:15.560 --> 26:17.360
during the break, community dev remarks.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.360
Hold on a minute.

26:18.360 --> 26:25.440
I will own masks for anyone who may be following along on the live stream who reads lips.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.440
Good morning again.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.880
You've probably heard me say good morning before.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.280
I'm going to say it again.

26:29.280 --> 26:34.020
For those of you who may be hungry, we have stacks available all day.

26:34.020 --> 26:39.400
You will find a vegan option on the table in the cake that is wrapped with the darker

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
colored ribbon.

26:40.400 --> 26:45.240
The vegetarian baked goods are sealed with a white ribbon.

26:45.240 --> 26:50.280
We have more gummy candy than I can take home.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.880
So please avail yourself of the gummy candy.

26:53.880 --> 27:00.360
I am fortunate enough to live in the town where Haribo, which was actually a company

27:00.360 --> 27:05.520
founded in Germany.

27:05.520 --> 27:11.160
You should eat this.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.240
As per usual, this room is run under FOSDEM's code of conduct.

27:15.240 --> 27:19.660
If anybody has anything they need addressed during the dev room today, you're welcome

27:19.660 --> 27:20.660
to come and see me.

27:20.660 --> 27:21.660
I'm Leslie.

27:21.660 --> 27:23.340
We can have a chat.

27:23.340 --> 27:27.280
You can also reach out to the FOSDEM team at conduct at FOSDEM.org.

27:27.280 --> 27:31.880
There is also a phone number listed on the FOSDEM site if you would like to make a call.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.800
Unfortunately, I do not have the capacity yet to memorize a number that long.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.960
I need more coffee.

27:37.960 --> 27:43.200
Yes, we really do.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.640
I will not do karaoke to entertain you during the break out of great respect for my friend

27:47.640 --> 27:49.800
Brian who does not find it pleasant.

27:49.800 --> 27:55.240
But there might have been some never going to give you up happening on the Grand Place

27:55.240 --> 27:57.720
last night after a few drinks.

27:57.720 --> 27:58.720
Not going to brick roll you either.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.800
I have too much respect for all of you.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.120
I don't know.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.280
But I sent you tonight.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.280
There was a thing.

28:06.280 --> 28:10.200
I'm just going to build a nice little social calendar page next year and actually be organized

28:10.200 --> 28:14.080
as opposed to being like, oh, wow, we're going to FOSDEM again.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.760
We're going to need to people.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.280
That's going to be hard.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.840
And we're the community people.

28:18.840 --> 28:24.280
I have great compassion for anyone else who is also having struggles with peopling.

28:24.280 --> 28:29.360
All right.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.920
This is one of those times when you should have memorized the fun facts like Hummingbird

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
has.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.920
Oh, let's do that.

28:37.920 --> 28:42.920
Did you move it?

28:42.920 --> 28:43.920
Yeah.

28:43.920 --> 28:56.440
It seems like a hole because it's a dimmer.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.240
Come out of the darkness, my friends.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.240
We have found the button.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.240
No, but it's easy to move internal.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.240
Yes.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.040
We are clearly not finding the button that we need to make things light.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.040
No.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.040
Press it again.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.040
Yes.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.800
Oh, it's very bright in here.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.800
Oh.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
We have succeeded in our quest.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.240
Oh, that's my email.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
We don't want to see my email.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.240
Potentially.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.240
Oh, yes.

29:22.240 --> 29:25.800
Okay, excellent.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.580
This is the door through which you entered the community dev room.

29:28.580 --> 29:32.440
Should you need to exit the community dev room during the talks, please exit through this

29:32.440 --> 29:33.440
door.

29:33.440 --> 29:38.800
Eventually, we will have a queue of thousands, well, at least many people who will want to

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
enter the dev room.

29:39.800 --> 29:46.840
It is much easier if we follow a proper queuing process to come in to my left and to exit

29:46.840 --> 29:49.760
to my right.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.560
I will continue poking this little thing because I want to make sure that we start things on

29:53.560 --> 30:10.320
time and also to...
