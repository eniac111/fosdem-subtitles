00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
All right, everybody, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah-Jane Whitfield.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.320
Hi, everyone.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.880
As you know now, my name is Sarah-Jane Whitfield.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.360
I'm an open source advisor at Google.

00:17.360 --> 00:22.480
This is my very first FOSDEM, very first in-person speaking engagement, so please bear with

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
me through the nerves.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.480
I'm the jetlash.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.480
Thank you.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.480
Thank you.

00:26.480 --> 00:27.480
Thank you.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.480
Thank you.

00:28.480 --> 00:34.000
Everyone I've met so far has been so nice, so gracious, so understanding.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.920
I really, really appreciate it.

00:36.920 --> 00:43.320
And I'll also say that while I'm going to nerd out quite a bit on this topic that I

00:43.320 --> 00:49.600
find super interesting, if you came here for answers about what exactly is the unauthorized

00:49.600 --> 00:54.320
practice of law, I regret to inform you that you will not be leaving with answers.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.720
You will be leaving with lots and lots of questions.

00:56.720 --> 01:02.760
And I hope that that will spur some discussion and we can think through some of the very

01:02.760 --> 01:07.640
fuzzy lines that determine what is or isn't the practice of law.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.560
Let's see.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
Hopefully this works.

01:11.560 --> 01:18.840
All right, so in light of the subject matter that I'm covering today, I wanted to just

01:18.840 --> 01:21.800
clarify that this is not legal advice.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.400
I am not your lawyer.

01:24.400 --> 01:29.600
This is for general informational purposes only.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.600
Likewise I have a few housekeeping notes.

01:31.600 --> 01:38.920
So typical American, I know, mostly going to be focusing, well exclusively going to

01:38.920 --> 01:45.760
be focusing on US law today, mostly because that's where most of the action is with regard

01:45.760 --> 01:47.400
to software at this time.

01:47.400 --> 01:52.280
It's also what I'm most familiar with when it comes to unauthorized practice of law.

01:52.280 --> 01:58.240
I absolutely acknowledge that basically every other jurisdiction around the world regulates

01:58.240 --> 02:00.800
the practice of law.

02:00.800 --> 02:06.600
And based on the research that I did before this talk, it appears that most other countries

02:06.600 --> 02:11.880
really distinguish and emphasize regulating the practice in a courtroom setting where

02:11.880 --> 02:19.720
you're actually representing a client in front of a judge way more than out of law practice.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.680
And it's less distinguished in the US.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.720
Finally, wanted to let you all know in the interest of time and everything that I want

02:30.720 --> 02:36.960
to cover, I'm going to be giving you high level summaries of various rules and three

02:36.960 --> 02:40.640
cases that I'll cover.

02:40.640 --> 02:46.260
And as I mentioned before, I'm going to leave you with some open-ended questions to consider.

02:46.260 --> 02:54.640
So to get started, by show of hands, is anyone familiar with a company called Do Not Pay?

02:54.640 --> 02:58.400
Okay, just a few of you.

02:58.400 --> 03:05.080
So Do Not Pay is a US-based company that was launched in 2015 initially providing a chatbot

03:05.080 --> 03:12.000
service that would help users fight traffic tickets.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.320
They expanded their services to deal with other consumer disputes like if your flight

03:17.320 --> 03:23.880
was canceled and you were eligible for a refund, the chatbot would help you through that process.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.120
If you wanted to cancel your free trial before you got charged, it would help you through

03:28.120 --> 03:30.000
that process.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.040
In 2018, they relaunched their app to integrate AI.

03:35.040 --> 03:39.560
I believe that they say that they're relying on IBM Watson.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.600
And they dubbed it the world's first robot lawyer.

03:43.600 --> 03:50.000
And they included various legal actions and legal document generation as part of their

03:50.000 --> 03:51.920
services.

03:51.920 --> 04:00.120
So if any of you are maybe in the future interested in getting involved more in the legal tech

04:00.120 --> 04:04.440
Twitter space, you'll see things pop up like this all the time.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.800
So in the past month, this happened after I had submitted this talk.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.160
So this worked out well for me.

04:12.160 --> 04:20.000
Do Not Pay announced in early January that their AI was going to actually represent someone

04:20.000 --> 04:27.280
live in court, in traffic court, to dispute a $200 traffic ticket.

04:27.280 --> 04:34.640
A few days later, they offered a million dollars to anyone who was willing to leverage their

04:34.640 --> 04:40.760
AI exclusively in arguing case in front of the Supreme Court.

04:40.760 --> 04:45.760
About a week later, it announced some additional legal products that it was releasing where

04:45.760 --> 04:55.760
it would summarize terms of service and lease agreement terms highlighting the terms that

04:55.760 --> 05:01.040
were not standard so that the consumer had a better understanding and more insight into

05:01.040 --> 05:08.160
what they were agreeing to and whether it was standard or not market if they were being

05:08.160 --> 05:11.080
taken advantage of.

05:11.080 --> 05:21.480
And they then confirmed that their case in the traffic court was actually supposed to

05:21.480 --> 05:23.960
take place on February 22.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.000
Everything was good to go.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.480
Three days after that announcement, they regretted to inform all of their followers that they

05:31.480 --> 05:35.680
were indefinitely postponing going live in any courtroom.

05:35.680 --> 05:42.440
And they were also going to roll back any of the legal services that their website offered.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.560
So what happened exactly?

05:44.560 --> 05:47.200
Lawyers, lawyers happened.

05:47.200 --> 05:53.680
Lawyers in the regulatory bodies in the US, the state bar associations said, ah, no, I

05:53.680 --> 05:55.680
think that's our job.

05:55.680 --> 06:02.440
This looks and smells a lot like the unauthorized practice of law.

06:02.440 --> 06:09.120
And along those lines, penalties across the board can include civil penalties, fines.

06:09.120 --> 06:16.760
It could also include jail time being incarcerated for the unauthorized practice of law.

06:16.760 --> 06:23.760
So Do Not Pay was not interested in pursuing that and waiting to see what might happen.

06:23.760 --> 06:31.200
The founder said he was surprised he had underestimated how seriously lawyers in the US would take

06:31.200 --> 06:35.200
a $200 speeding ticket.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.800
So again, I said that you're likely going to leave with more questions and answers today.

06:40.800 --> 06:47.240
I would love to give you a clear definition for what the practice of law actually is.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.640
But unfortunately, there is not one unifying definition.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.400
Each state regulates the practice of law.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.680
So each state has their own definition for what the practice of law is.

06:57.680 --> 07:05.600
And they very much like keeping it vague instead of enumerating every possible action or type

07:05.600 --> 07:11.320
of speech that may constitute the practice of law, which means that you kind of have

07:11.320 --> 07:15.400
to wait and see what happens in court or take a very conservative approach and just leave

07:15.400 --> 07:18.720
it to the lawyers.

07:18.720 --> 07:23.800
So along those lines, I've already mentioned that there are lots of different penalties

07:23.800 --> 07:25.760
that anyone may face.

07:25.760 --> 07:29.640
But I also want to emphasize that this doesn't just apply to lawyers.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.560
This covers non-lawyers as well.

07:32.560 --> 07:40.720
So if anyone is familiar with the US TV show Suits, which is what made Meghan Markle quite

07:40.720 --> 07:47.040
famous, at least in the States, the main character is the quintessential case of the unauthorized

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
practice of law.

07:48.040 --> 07:53.440
Someone that did not have a law license, didn't go to law school, and he pretended to be a

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
lawyer.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.640
Surprise, surprise, he was brilliant.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.640
He does a great job.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.080
But there's always this looming specter that someone's going to find out and he's going

08:00.080 --> 08:03.600
to be in a lot of trouble for the unauthorized practice of law.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.240
So that's the typical case.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.040
But it also applies to lawyers.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.160
So just wanted to clarify that.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.320
Now I tried to distill the common elements.

08:15.320 --> 08:25.280
I read tons of cases, tons of articles and law journal notes and articles about this

08:25.280 --> 08:26.680
topic.

08:26.680 --> 08:33.880
And I was able to divide the most common elements of unauthorized practice of law or UPL into

08:33.880 --> 08:36.040
these two main buckets.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.560
And they're going to look nearly identical.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.440
But I'll talk through some of the distinctions in a moment.

08:41.440 --> 08:48.920
So the first bucket deals with legal advice that's given by a person or entity that does

08:48.920 --> 08:53.000
not have a law license in the relevant jurisdiction.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.160
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense and legalese.

08:56.160 --> 09:04.160
The second bucket is legal services for compensation given by a person or entity that does not

09:04.160 --> 09:06.840
have a law license in the relevant jurisdiction.

09:06.840 --> 09:12.680
So the clearest delineation that anyone could draw just by looking at the two of these is

09:12.680 --> 09:14.840
the first two bullet points.

09:14.840 --> 09:22.520
In particular, the legal services tends to specify that it's for compensation, whereas

09:22.520 --> 09:24.280
legal advice does not.

09:24.280 --> 09:33.240
So does that mean that if I provide legal services for free that I'm not liable for

09:33.240 --> 09:35.680
unauthorized practice of law?

09:35.680 --> 09:41.800
Unfortunately not, because some states will then deem or may deem your provision of legal

09:41.800 --> 09:45.240
services as also providing legal advice.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.880
And they don't distinguish in most cases giving legal advice.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.520
You can give that away for free and still be held liable.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
So isn't great.

09:53.520 --> 09:58.960
There are also a bunch of other nuanced distinctions that hopefully you'll start to see come through

09:58.960 --> 10:11.040
as I discuss the cases in how courts look at and distinguish between what is legal advice

10:11.040 --> 10:17.880
and what legal services are.

10:17.880 --> 10:24.000
So since I can't give you a definition for the practice of law, and we couldn't really

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
back into it from looking at what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, let's talk

10:31.000 --> 10:35.200
about the public policy rationale for why this exists at all.

10:35.200 --> 10:41.400
This quote is from a 1952 Missouri Supreme Court case.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.640
And despite its age, I think it sums up the gist of the public policy rationale pretty

10:46.640 --> 10:47.640
well.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.600
At the end of the day, it comes down to consumer protection.

10:50.600 --> 10:56.480
This theoretically is not supposed to be about protecting lawyers and their livelihoods,

10:56.480 --> 11:02.320
creating a monopoly over who can give legal advice and provide legal services.

11:02.320 --> 11:07.960
What it's really supposed to do is protect the public and make sure that if they're getting

11:07.960 --> 11:13.840
advice, if they're relying on someone else, that it's actually reliable, that it's competent

11:13.840 --> 11:22.400
advice and that maybe there's some repercussions if that doesn't hold water.

11:22.400 --> 11:30.800
So in light of that great public policy theory, what does that actually look like in practice?

11:30.800 --> 11:38.000
The options for legal representation in the US come down to, well, you can do it yourself,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
all alone.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.240
You can do it through research, fill out your own forms, draft your own documents, file your

11:44.240 --> 11:45.240
own things.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.640
That's what we call pro se representation.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.800
Or you can hire a lawyer, which tends to be expensive.

11:50.800 --> 11:55.680
And if you don't already have a connection through family or friends to a lawyer, it

11:55.680 --> 11:59.760
can be really hard to track down the right person.

11:59.760 --> 12:06.960
And additionally, your claim may not be worth their time since they charge by the hour.

12:06.960 --> 12:13.840
And finally, in very limited circumstances, mostly confined to criminal cases, a court

12:13.840 --> 12:15.880
may actually appoint a lawyer to you.

12:15.880 --> 12:23.160
But that's not really a viable option for the vast majority of especially civil cases

12:23.160 --> 12:26.400
that deal with consumer protection.

12:26.400 --> 12:31.800
So how's that public policy rationale looking in practice?

12:31.800 --> 12:34.480
Clearly there's a bit of a disconnect.

12:34.480 --> 12:42.000
Additionally, the US is currently suffering from what many call a crisis in terms of access

12:42.000 --> 12:51.160
to justice, access to efficient, affordable, reasonable expectation of justice and the

12:51.160 --> 12:57.000
ability to interact with the justice system.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.360
And based on this quote and all of the other relevant demographics and statistics about

13:03.360 --> 13:12.360
this issue, it largely impacts low and middle income individuals who can't afford legal

13:12.360 --> 13:15.480
services.

13:15.480 --> 13:22.600
So to get back to the unauthorized practice of law, again, I wanted to try and find a

13:22.600 --> 13:31.680
way to describe the various ways that a court may consider, since we don't have clear definitions,

13:31.680 --> 13:38.560
what may bump over into the category, what may cross that fuzzy line into the unauthorized

13:38.560 --> 13:39.800
practice.

13:39.800 --> 13:47.120
And so these are various high level categories of what may tip the scales.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.800
But again, to clarify, there's no clear set framework that anyone is following.

13:51.800 --> 13:58.680
There's no set determination that, oh, well, if they disclaimed that they're not a lawyer

13:58.680 --> 14:05.560
and it's not legal advice like I did earlier, then it's clearly outside the realm and can't

14:05.560 --> 14:07.640
be held liable.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.400
There's no clear line drawn.

14:09.400 --> 14:16.480
If I am giving you legal advice for free, again, as I said, it very well may not be

14:16.480 --> 14:19.880
exempt from liability.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.400
So you'll see some of those factors come up again in these cases in the interest of time.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.000
Again, I want to kickstart the first case.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.400
So this is Janssen versus LegalZoom.

14:29.400 --> 14:38.400
Quite some time ago, 2011, this was a case that took place in Missouri.

14:38.400 --> 14:46.400
And LegalZoom, for anyone who's not familiar, is a website that offers legal services throughout

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
the United States.

14:48.400 --> 14:57.400
When they initially started, it was just their basic legal forms that someone could buy,

14:57.400 --> 15:01.400
print out, and fill in themselves and do whatever they wanted with.

15:01.400 --> 15:07.400
That's what the court considered the goods that LegalZoom offered.

15:07.400 --> 15:14.400
They expanded into building out a program, essentially a decision tree, where they provided

15:14.400 --> 15:20.400
questionnaires to their customers, and then would generate legal documents based on the

15:20.400 --> 15:21.400
user input.

15:21.400 --> 15:27.400
That's what the court, in this case, deemed the services that were provided for sale.

15:27.400 --> 15:32.160
Sorry, lost my place.

15:32.160 --> 15:38.080
So LegalZoom did make a lot of statements that they were not a law firm, they were not

15:38.080 --> 15:39.400
providing legal advice.

15:39.400 --> 15:51.400
This was meant to be self-help services, and no actual harm was cited in the case as being

15:51.400 --> 15:56.160
done to the public or to the actual customers of LegalZoom.

15:56.160 --> 16:01.800
Despite all of this, the court still found that the sale of the services constituted

16:01.800 --> 16:05.200
unauthorized practice of law.

16:05.200 --> 16:11.920
In particular, I wanted to call this to your attention, the court specifically honed in

16:11.920 --> 16:22.080
on the fact that a human had programmed the software to generate the legal documents.

16:22.080 --> 16:30.400
Since the human that programmed it was not a Missouri licensed attorney, but they had

16:30.400 --> 16:35.520
to have relied on Missouri law in order to generate documents that would affect a Missouri

16:35.520 --> 16:43.480
resident, that they clearly must have been making legal determinations, just like a Missouri

16:43.480 --> 16:48.360
licensed attorney would do a client intake and ask a series of questions of the client,

16:48.360 --> 16:52.720
and then use that to inform what documents they would choose and what content made it

16:52.720 --> 16:56.160
into those documents.

16:56.160 --> 17:03.720
The first open-ended question that I want you all to consider is this was decided just

17:03.720 --> 17:06.000
over 10 years ago now.

17:06.000 --> 17:14.160
How might the court have viewed this human programmer input if this were an AI model

17:14.160 --> 17:21.960
instead, based on where technology has come and where the layperson understanding of what

17:21.960 --> 17:24.000
technology is capable of doing?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.120
How might that affect how courts look at this?

17:26.120 --> 17:32.360
Let's fast forward 10 years to 2021.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.320
This is a Miami-based startup called Ticked.

17:36.320 --> 17:41.440
They were sued by the Florida Bar Association for allegedly violating the unauthorized practice

17:41.440 --> 17:44.680
of law regulations.

17:44.680 --> 17:52.160
Ticked had developed an app that would connect anyone who had gotten a traffic ticket with

17:52.160 --> 17:58.320
a licensed Florida attorney to resolve the case, and they did it for an upfront flat

17:58.320 --> 18:06.320
fee based on a percentage of the total violation fee on the face value of that ticket.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.600
It built an algorithm.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.700
This is the main business model.

18:09.700 --> 18:16.160
They built an algorithm that used court data on the likelihood of ticket being dismissed

18:16.160 --> 18:23.200
in court or being charged fees or accruing points in excess of the face value of the

18:23.200 --> 18:28.960
ticket to come up with what was actually going to be profitable, kind of like an insurance

18:28.960 --> 18:33.920
company will calculate the risk that you as a young, healthy person are going to suffer

18:33.920 --> 18:38.200
some catastrophic loss and they're going to have to pay big.

18:38.200 --> 18:43.240
It's probably a low likelihood, so they charge you, at least in the United States.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.800
Forgive the example.

18:44.800 --> 18:50.240
In the U.S., we get charged a lot of money to pay for our health insurance and usually

18:50.240 --> 18:55.680
don't see a return on that unless something really bad happens.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.520
That's a story for another time.

18:59.520 --> 19:07.440
To get back to the ticked case, they made it very, very clear in all of their website

19:07.440 --> 19:15.920
communications in their terms of service, everywhere on their site, that they were not

19:15.920 --> 19:17.280
providing legal services.

19:17.280 --> 19:21.000
They were going to connect you with a licensed attorney who would take over and handle the

19:21.000 --> 19:24.400
case for you.

19:24.400 --> 19:30.320
Their sole responsibility would be determining whether or not your case was a good fit, referring

19:30.320 --> 19:35.720
to a licensed attorney, and then negotiating that flat fee on your behalf with the attorney.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.440
They would take care of all the payments.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.960
Once the connection was made between the customer and the attorney, ticked removed itself from

19:42.960 --> 19:47.640
that relationship other than providing the financing to pay the attorney at any related

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
costs.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.560
Likewise, the lawyers were not employees.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.640
I'm running out of time.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.060
To skip ahead, no harm was done.

19:58.060 --> 20:02.960
There were two groups that filed amicus briefs, one in support of the Florida Bar, one in

20:02.960 --> 20:06.720
support of ticked.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.360
Surprise surprise, they were at odds.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.640
One was a group of private practice attorneys in competition with ticked.

20:11.640 --> 20:19.040
The other was a group of consumer rights activists and legal aid services.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.200
Back to that public policy rationale.

20:22.200 --> 20:27.880
In a 4-3 decision in the Florida Supreme Court, they found that ticked was engaged in the

20:27.880 --> 20:35.560
unauthorized practice of law and cited a number of potential harms that may befall their customers,

20:35.560 --> 20:38.520
but no actual harm.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.000
This was enough justification.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.880
The majority had even said that they lauded the idea that technology was lowering the

20:46.880 --> 20:56.760
barrier of entry to getting legal services, to having public benefit and public convenience,

20:56.760 --> 21:02.840
but that still was not enough to knock out the unauthorized practice of law claims.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.840
The minority dissent, I'm not going to have time to cover it in full, but it's great if

21:06.840 --> 21:07.960
you have a chance to read it.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.600
I have citations in my slides.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.560
Essentially, they say, hey, this is a hedge.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.680
This is purely financial.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.200
It has nothing to do with law.

21:16.200 --> 21:21.000
All you're getting is certainty of this is the flat fee that I pay and that's all that

21:21.000 --> 21:22.480
I'm going to pay.

21:22.480 --> 21:27.560
It has nothing to do with legal, lawyers handle all of the legal stuff.

21:27.560 --> 21:32.200
This should not have been considered unauthorized practice of law.

21:32.200 --> 21:39.160
In Ray Peterson involved, I'm going to skip through this, forgive me, the nonprofit called

21:39.160 --> 21:41.160
Upsolve.

21:41.160 --> 21:47.040
Upsolve provides free legal services to low-income individuals to file for personal bankruptcy

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
in the US.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.460
Again, no harm done.

21:51.460 --> 21:54.520
No fees charged.

21:54.520 --> 22:01.520
Upsolve was still found to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of law despite plenty

22:01.520 --> 22:06.360
of disclaimers relying on government issued forms and instruction sheets and publicly

22:06.360 --> 22:11.120
available information, making sure that they were only serving clients that had very basic

22:11.120 --> 22:17.480
cases that didn't require additional legal advice or input.

22:17.480 --> 22:22.760
Had a lot of controls in place, but unfortunately, it was not enough.

22:22.760 --> 22:32.200
Fortunately, unlike TIC, Upsolve was able to work with the bankruptcy court to make

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
changes.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.520
They're currently working with the bankruptcy court to make changes to their program so

22:36.520 --> 22:42.360
that they can continue their services, whereas TIC actually had to shut down.

22:42.360 --> 22:49.440
They are no longer active and able to conduct business in the state of Florida.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.440
This is a handy chart.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.880
Again, forgive me for the time.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.720
We won't be able to get to everything, but I did want to note here in the three cases

22:57.720 --> 23:01.880
that I talked about, Upsolve is the only one that did not charge for their services, and

23:01.880 --> 23:08.080
yet they were still found to be in violation of unauthorized practice of law.

23:08.080 --> 23:14.760
In the legal Zoom case, I didn't cover this, but they were providing some direct filings

23:14.760 --> 23:22.360
on behalf of their customers, which in the case law is considered in court, which usually

23:22.360 --> 23:24.080
is a higher threshold.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.880
Everywhere else was out of court.

23:25.880 --> 23:29.400
There was no interaction with judges.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.520
There was no in-person representation.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.520
Finally, I wanted to distinguish the decisions.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.240
All three were unauthorized practice of law.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.080
Legal Zoom is still operating in Missouri.

23:40.080 --> 23:45.920
They settled the class action lawsuit, and they worked out a deal with the state in order

23:45.920 --> 23:52.320
to change some of their services and disclaimers and get around any future claims of unauthorized

23:52.320 --> 23:54.080
practice of law.

23:54.080 --> 24:00.480
Same in Upsolve, at least for now, but TIC did have to discontinue their services.

24:00.480 --> 24:07.640
One thing that I left out is that Upsolve, I found out this morning, which is why it's

24:07.640 --> 24:15.360
at the very end, Upsolve has released publicly some of their software on their GitHub org.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.600
I don't know.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.400
It wasn't cited in the case.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.800
It is free and available under open source licenses.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.560
I don't know if this was the software that was involved or at issue in the case.

24:26.560 --> 24:33.720
It wasn't specified, but interesting to note that open source software is involved.

24:33.720 --> 24:39.120
The reason that I'm bringing this up at the very end, I know I'm at time, is these are

24:39.120 --> 24:40.560
some additional open questions.

24:40.560 --> 24:46.680
In light of the various facts and elements that a court will consider in terms of what

24:46.680 --> 24:54.080
is the unauthorized practice of law, where it falls down, I wanted to address what effects

24:54.080 --> 24:55.720
this may have on FOSS projects.

24:55.720 --> 25:03.240
Everyone knows I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to give you my opinion about something.

25:03.240 --> 25:07.440
Licenses contain warranties and disclaimers, et cetera.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.920
I don't have time to cover all of this.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.640
Forgive me again.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
You've been a great audience.

25:12.640 --> 25:15.720
I really appreciate your patience with me.

25:15.720 --> 25:16.720
Please check out the slides.

25:16.720 --> 25:19.760
They're already uploaded.
