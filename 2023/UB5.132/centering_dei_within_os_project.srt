1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.880
We are getting there.

2
0:00:13.880 --> 0:00:18.880
We are almost there.

3
0:00:18.880 --> 0:00:22.800
I keep encouraging everybody to take more Haribo, but I don't think we have enough left

4
0:00:22.800 --> 0:00:25.000
to encourage massive runs on the Haribo.

5
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:31.560
We also have Ritter Sport, if you need it.

6
0:00:31.560 --> 0:00:36.520
Wonderful humans, I live in the town where they make the Haribo gummy candies, so please

7
0:00:36.520 --> 0:00:37.600
take the gummy candies.

8
0:00:37.600 --> 0:00:39.800
I can get more easily.

9
0:00:39.800 --> 0:00:49.400
Do not need the extras to go back on the train with me to Germany.

10
0:00:49.400 --> 0:00:54.080
While we are getting set up and having a little bit of additional technical difficulty, all

11
0:00:54.080 --> 0:00:58.840
of us are getting ready to go back on the train.

12
0:00:58.840 --> 0:01:01.560
I am getting very happy over here because we have our next generation of Fosdomers hanging

13
0:01:01.560 --> 0:01:03.480
out and getting candy now too.

14
0:01:03.480 --> 0:01:08.000
Yeah, that's right.

15
0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:15.080
Sadly I couldn't bring my daughter with me, but when she was all of 33 days old, she went

16
0:01:15.080 --> 0:01:17.920
to her first Fosdom.

17
0:01:17.920 --> 0:01:20.000
I am looking forward to her next Fosdom.

18
0:01:20.000 --> 0:01:30.400
No, although I did get one conference to make her a lanyard that said future speaker, so

19
0:01:30.400 --> 0:01:33.080
that made me feel happy.

20
0:01:33.080 --> 0:01:36.880
I think I am going to try and bring her to DevConf this year if at all possible.

21
0:01:36.880 --> 0:01:41.480
The German school system is very rigorous about thou shalt not miss school time, so

22
0:01:41.480 --> 0:01:46.000
it's a little more difficult.

23
0:01:46.000 --> 0:01:50.280
We'll.

24
0:01:50.280 --> 0:01:58.160
La la la la.

25
0:01:58.160 --> 0:02:03.320
If you want to la la la la la, you totally can.

26
0:02:03.320 --> 0:02:07.120
There may be karaoke coming on.

27
0:02:07.120 --> 0:02:08.760
I know you're going to leave.

28
0:02:08.760 --> 0:02:14.600
It's worth the risk to me to entertain our adoring public, Mr. Prophet, but we will try

29
0:02:14.600 --> 0:02:18.000
and avoid it because we care for you.

30
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:23.040
Is everybody both enjoying their Fosdom and exhausted and ready to go home?

31
0:02:23.040 --> 0:02:26.240
Yes, okay, that's all right.

32
0:02:26.240 --> 0:02:30.280
Sometimes exhaustion is where we end up, but in the good way, in the we're full of happiness

33
0:02:30.280 --> 0:02:34.120
and good ideas way and filled with delicious candy.

34
0:02:34.120 --> 0:02:39.240
Welcome, welcome, welcome, lovely people who are just joining us.

35
0:02:39.240 --> 0:02:47.920
We're still working on convincing the, watch me go.

36
0:02:47.920 --> 0:02:55.120
Everybody centering DEI in your open source project.

37
0:02:55.120 --> 0:03:11.780
Okay, on the topics, good.

38
0:03:11.780 --> 0:03:38.500
Hi, everybody.

39
0:03:38.500 --> 0:03:41.700
It's great to be here and it's great to see people.

40
0:03:41.700 --> 0:03:50.700
I'm Matt German-Prey and I'm one of the co-founders of the Chaos Project and I'm also a professor

41
0:03:50.700 --> 0:03:55.820
by day at the University of Nebraska Omaha in the College of Information Science and

42
0:03:55.820 --> 0:03:58.580
Technology and it's really great to be here.

43
0:03:58.580 --> 0:04:06.340
So just real briefly, I'm going to be giving this talk with Justin and Kristi so they can

44
0:04:06.340 --> 0:04:11.460
kind of introduce themselves when they come up and we also have a slide that introduces

45
0:04:11.460 --> 0:04:13.120
them as well.

46
0:04:13.120 --> 0:04:19.980
So the Chaos Project, as Dawn was actually alluding to in her last talk, which was a

47
0:04:19.980 --> 0:04:27.660
great segue, is a project that's focused on open source health and sustainability.

48
0:04:27.660 --> 0:04:34.400
So creating metrics and software as well as programs because there are a lot of metrics

49
0:04:34.400 --> 0:04:41.980
that can't necessarily be determined through software that require qualitative and human

50
0:04:41.980 --> 0:04:44.540
efforts to understand.

51
0:04:44.540 --> 0:04:50.300
So we develop those types of metrics and software and programs.

52
0:04:50.300 --> 0:04:56.460
As part of what we do in the Chaos Project, diversity, equity and inclusion is a key component

53
0:04:56.460 --> 0:05:02.380
to understand with respect to the health and sustainability of projects.

54
0:05:02.380 --> 0:05:09.260
And for ourselves, we looked at the Chaos Project and thought how can we not only help

55
0:05:09.260 --> 0:05:16.020
others think about diversity, equity and inclusion with respect to their projects, but also reflect

56
0:05:16.020 --> 0:05:20.980
ourselves about our own diversity, equity and inclusion.

57
0:05:20.980 --> 0:05:26.620
So how can we as a project better center diversity, equity and inclusion within the Chaos Project

58
0:05:26.620 --> 0:05:32.660
and then subsequently help others do the same from our experience?

59
0:05:32.660 --> 0:05:39.140
So I would like to first say thanks to the Ford Foundation who has provided support for

60
0:05:39.140 --> 0:05:45.060
this reflection over the last, it's been a year and a half now, and it'll complete in

61
0:05:45.060 --> 0:05:49.020
about two, it'll complete in about another six months.

62
0:05:49.020 --> 0:05:54.140
And so through the support from the Ford Foundation, it's been really great because we've been

63
0:05:54.140 --> 0:06:00.720
able to have consistency in our team of people helping us do the reflection, including Kristi

64
0:06:00.720 --> 0:06:07.420
and Justin, as well as come to places like FOSDIM and talk about our experience and what

65
0:06:07.420 --> 0:06:11.580
we've learned and share that with other people.

66
0:06:11.580 --> 0:06:17.340
So the team, oh that got cut off a little, it's close.

67
0:06:17.340 --> 0:06:24.100
So the team, Celia got cut off, so we have Kristi, we have Justin, we have Sean, Guy,

68
0:06:24.100 --> 0:06:24.420
and

69
0:06:24.420 --> 0:06:25.420
and

70
0:06:25.420 --> 0:06:29.740
Gagans, we have Georgia Bulin, who's there in the center, we have Elizabeth Barron, who

71
0:06:29.740 --> 0:06:36.860
is the Chaos Community Manager, we have Ruth Ikega, who couldn't come, she's on the right,

72
0:06:36.860 --> 0:06:43.060
and then in the upper right corner I think you only see a very small part of Cela, but

73
0:06:43.060 --> 0:06:49.340
it's Cela Yang, who is also part of the team for this reflection, and then myself in the

74
0:06:49.340 --> 0:06:51.060
lower right hand corner.

75
0:06:51.060 --> 0:06:54.460
So it's been an amazing group of people, and like I said, through the Ford Foundation

76
0:06:54.460 --> 0:07:02.420
support we've been able to stay together as a team throughout the entire reflection.

77
0:07:02.420 --> 0:07:07.780
So here are the speakers, again, Justin you're cut off.

78
0:07:07.780 --> 0:07:12.020
That's okay, hopefully there aren't a lot of words that get cut off there when we show

79
0:07:12.020 --> 0:07:13.780
what we're showing.

80
0:07:13.780 --> 0:07:18.740
But again, I'm Matt Gerwinpre, we have Kristi Progrie and Justin Flori, and I think Justin's

81
0:07:18.740 --> 0:07:23.420
going to talk kind of about our first, we have four things that we're going to talk

82
0:07:23.420 --> 0:07:28.060
about that were part of this reflection, and Justin will talk about two of them, and Kristi

83
0:07:28.060 --> 0:07:32.500
will also talk about two of them, and then we'd really love to kind of hear from you

84
0:07:32.500 --> 0:07:36.620
all and answer questions the best that we can or any thoughts that you might have.

85
0:07:36.620 --> 0:07:38.820
So Justin, I'm going to turn it over to you.

86
0:07:38.820 --> 0:07:42.980
Should we do quick round introductions too of all of us?

87
0:07:42.980 --> 0:07:45.820
I'm done, I met Gerwinpre.

88
0:07:45.820 --> 0:07:52.060
I'm Justin Flori, so I'm currently with Red Hat as the Fedora community architect, so

89
0:07:52.060 --> 0:07:56.700
I'm working in the Fedora community day by day, but I've also been involved with the

90
0:07:56.700 --> 0:08:00.420
Chaos Project that we're going to be talking a little bit about here for the last five

91
0:08:00.420 --> 0:08:06.220
years, and then working with our awesome group of folks on this DEI review for the last two.

92
0:08:06.220 --> 0:08:12.180
Hello everyone, so I'm Kristi Progrie, I'm currently the program manager for the GNOME

93
0:08:12.180 --> 0:08:19.260
Foundation, and I'm also part of the Chaos community for around one year and a half now,

94
0:08:19.260 --> 0:08:24.180
and also contributing in their diversity and inclusion working group.

95
0:08:24.180 --> 0:08:28.500
I'm going to go sit down.

96
0:08:28.500 --> 0:08:29.500
Yes.

97
0:08:29.500 --> 0:08:35.500
All right, so let's look at the first two points of our reflection.

98
0:08:35.500 --> 0:08:38.740
So again, this was just the background context again.

99
0:08:38.740 --> 0:08:43.820
So this was work that we started about two years ago, and we were coming into this reflection.

100
0:08:43.820 --> 0:08:47.940
We were starting really from the very beginning.

101
0:08:47.940 --> 0:08:52.620
We were going to take a look at the Chaos Project to understand where could we better

102
0:08:52.620 --> 0:08:58.060
focus our efforts and spend our time and energy and resources to make things better.

103
0:08:58.060 --> 0:09:02.900
So over that journey, the four points that we're going to be sharing here are basically

104
0:09:02.900 --> 0:09:07.520
the outcomes of this journey that we've been on for the last two years.

105
0:09:07.520 --> 0:09:11.660
So you're getting a little bit more of the polished end result of this, so it'll be

106
0:09:11.660 --> 0:09:13.420
nice bullet point list.

107
0:09:13.420 --> 0:09:17.100
But you can also keep in mind that when we started with this reflection, we were kind

108
0:09:17.100 --> 0:09:18.620
of like, where do we begin?

109
0:09:18.620 --> 0:09:24.500
And this was a lot of conversations that brought us to this point and engaging with our community

110
0:09:24.500 --> 0:09:31.460
to learn some of these things that helped us define some of our efforts.

111
0:09:31.460 --> 0:09:35.180
So without further ado, the four highlights.

112
0:09:35.180 --> 0:09:38.780
Whoops, there's a little bit of a lag.

113
0:09:38.780 --> 0:09:41.860
Okay, we didn't get it all cut off.

114
0:09:41.860 --> 0:09:46.980
So I'll be talking a little bit around our newcomer initiatives and engagements, and

115
0:09:46.980 --> 0:09:51.260
also talk a little bit around our global efforts.

116
0:09:51.260 --> 0:09:55.780
So across the span of the last two years, no, I guess I kind of already covered this.

117
0:09:55.780 --> 0:09:58.940
So the first part on the newcomer experience.

118
0:09:58.940 --> 0:10:04.580
So with the creation of new support structures, along with an increased emphasis on mentoring,

119
0:10:04.580 --> 0:10:09.980
the chaos project has grown a lot, really tremendously with new contributors in the

120
0:10:09.980 --> 0:10:12.420
last couple of years.

121
0:10:12.420 --> 0:10:18.100
New onboarding pathways were developed, and we prioritize the refinement of these pathways

122
0:10:18.100 --> 0:10:19.100
too.

123
0:10:19.100 --> 0:10:22.620
I might say part of this was also kind of the right time at the right place, because

124
0:10:22.620 --> 0:10:26.940
I think as we were kind of going into COVID as well, and everything was really shifting

125
0:10:26.940 --> 0:10:32.260
into a virtual format, as we were spending more time thinking about the newcomer experience,

126
0:10:32.260 --> 0:10:36.700
I also think there was more of an interest in folks trying to get involved with open

127
0:10:36.700 --> 0:10:41.540
source projects, which also opened the door for lots of folks that we ended up engaging

128
0:10:41.540 --> 0:10:45.500
with from countries and places all over the world.

129
0:10:45.500 --> 0:10:51.620
So ultimately, many of us long time FOSS contributors remember well what it is like to get involved

130
0:10:51.620 --> 0:10:56.420
in a new project, and trying to figure out where do you begin.

131
0:10:56.420 --> 0:10:58.380
It's easy to get overwhelmed.

132
0:10:58.380 --> 0:11:03.100
And ultimately, many of us long time FOSS contributors remember well what it's like,

133
0:11:03.100 --> 0:11:09.100
or at the same time, ensuring newcomers have a clear pathway to get onboarded is important

134
0:11:09.100 --> 0:11:13.980
for project sustainability and keeping things going.

135
0:11:13.980 --> 0:11:18.300
So new faces should always be coming and going, as well as mingling with the older faces and

136
0:11:18.300 --> 0:11:20.320
people that have been in the community.

137
0:11:20.320 --> 0:11:25.200
So keeping those signs of folks who have been around for a long while while also still having

138
0:11:25.200 --> 0:11:30.740
new faces coming into the fold and the mix is important for community growth and sustainability.

139
0:11:30.740 --> 0:11:37.580
Additionally, newcomers have that unique perspective as a first time observer to your community.

140
0:11:37.580 --> 0:11:42.500
And you can learn a lot by listening actively to them and their perspectives that they're

141
0:11:42.500 --> 0:11:44.540
bringing to your community.

142
0:11:44.540 --> 0:11:51.740
So one key takeaway here is helping newcomers see and understand the impact of their work.

143
0:11:51.740 --> 0:11:55.020
It's important to validate the small contributions.

144
0:11:55.020 --> 0:11:59.340
In a way, you almost need to hype people up on their participation.

145
0:11:59.340 --> 0:12:03.420
It feels great, actually kind of like what Don was just talking about in the last talk,

146
0:12:03.420 --> 0:12:08.100
it feels great when you know your efforts are appreciated and made a difference to someone

147
0:12:08.100 --> 0:12:11.820
else, all that soft squishy human stuff.

148
0:12:11.820 --> 0:12:18.100
So one wish list item for developing metrics or measurements in a FOSS project is showing

149
0:12:18.100 --> 0:12:22.220
and measuring the impact of a newcomer contribution.

150
0:12:22.220 --> 0:12:26.700
So both trying to come up with a way to measure and understand that, but also kind of around

151
0:12:26.700 --> 0:12:31.620
this recognition piece of making sure that the people making that contribution also understand

152
0:12:31.620 --> 0:12:34.140
that impact of their contribution.

153
0:12:34.140 --> 0:12:38.820
Additionally, newcomers need to feel safe and welcome in the community.

154
0:12:38.820 --> 0:12:44.620
They need space to try out new ideas and more importantly, to make mistakes and mess up

155
0:12:44.620 --> 0:12:47.380
because that's where you really learn.

156
0:12:47.380 --> 0:12:53.180
So having a safe environment is important for people to test and validate their wildest

157
0:12:53.180 --> 0:12:58.620
ideas and a welcoming community gives them the opportunity to bounce back when something

158
0:12:58.620 --> 0:13:00.500
doesn't work out.

159
0:13:00.500 --> 0:13:06.500
So one key part of unlocking creativity and innovation is making sure that people bring

160
0:13:06.500 --> 0:13:12.060
their best and that a newcomer has the space that they need to bring their best while they're

161
0:13:12.060 --> 0:13:16.060
learning more about the project and the community.

162
0:13:16.060 --> 0:13:21.660
In short, avoid this tendency to over-celebrate your long-term contributors.

163
0:13:21.660 --> 0:13:27.580
We also want to recognize those folks, but I really like, I think it was someone in our

164
0:13:27.580 --> 0:13:31.780
group who put it as the emphasis is really to share the spotlight.

165
0:13:31.780 --> 0:13:36.500
So making sure that there's an equitable focus of how you're recognizing and validating people's

166
0:13:36.500 --> 0:13:39.540
contributions in your community.

167
0:13:39.540 --> 0:13:45.100
And also kind of a side point, or not only side point, but the importance of diversity

168
0:13:45.100 --> 0:13:49.700
and leadership I think is a tie-in here with that newcomer experience.

169
0:13:49.700 --> 0:13:54.820
So it's kind of an unwritten point in the slide deck here, but in our Chaos DEI review

170
0:13:54.820 --> 0:13:59.740
team we have one of the people who we really wanted to be here, Ruth Akega, who has done

171
0:13:59.740 --> 0:14:04.380
a lot with that newcomer onboarding in the Chaos Project.

172
0:14:04.380 --> 0:14:09.180
She was really hands-on with the mentoring and onboarding of the new contributors, especially

173
0:14:09.180 --> 0:14:13.380
across Western Africa where she's originally from.

174
0:14:13.380 --> 0:14:18.260
And Ruth worked directly with the newcomers, but also brought visibility to the challenges

175
0:14:18.260 --> 0:14:23.500
and issues, but also the success points for the people she was working with to our group,

176
0:14:23.500 --> 0:14:26.300
to the DEI review team.

177
0:14:26.300 --> 0:14:30.100
So in the same way, she was very hands-on with engaging with those people, but she was

178
0:14:30.100 --> 0:14:35.620
also sharing these experiences back with our review team so that we had better visibility

179
0:14:35.620 --> 0:14:36.820
and insight to that.

180
0:14:36.820 --> 0:14:41.180
So at the more, I guess a higher level in the project, we could think how could we align,

181
0:14:41.180 --> 0:14:46.180
again, our time, resources, and energy to make sure that we're supporting and welcoming

182
0:14:46.180 --> 0:14:50.500
in all these new people to the project community.

183
0:14:50.500 --> 0:14:55.740
So the takeaway on this point is to choose folks from regions, especially with less representation,

184
0:14:55.740 --> 0:15:00.540
to try to encourage them into these leadership roles or find somewhere in the project where

185
0:15:00.540 --> 0:15:02.700
they can make that impact.

186
0:15:02.700 --> 0:15:09.140
It makes it easier to build relationships with those newcomers to the project.

187
0:15:09.140 --> 0:15:12.900
I think, oh, global efforts, right.

188
0:15:12.900 --> 0:15:17.500
So when you're trying to fix things, challenges are going to come up.

189
0:15:17.500 --> 0:15:21.660
It's important to have this persistence in the face of challenges when necessary.

190
0:15:21.660 --> 0:15:28.460
And when you're trying to pivot a project's focus toward DEI challenges, or towards DEI,

191
0:15:28.460 --> 0:15:31.500
these challenges are going to be inevitable.

192
0:15:31.500 --> 0:15:38.780
The work is a kind of cultural, organizational culture work, and that stuff is really hard.

193
0:15:38.780 --> 0:15:43.460
So again, there's kind of this piece that there's a historical resistance to change.

194
0:15:43.460 --> 0:15:44.540
Change is hard.

195
0:15:44.540 --> 0:15:47.540
We don't like it.

196
0:15:47.540 --> 0:15:51.420
Sometimes there's a, I read this, there's actually a comic I was reading a while back

197
0:15:51.420 --> 0:15:55.660
that we have this part in our brain that when we, there's something that's challenging our

198
0:15:55.660 --> 0:15:58.340
beliefs or ideals that we kind of freeze up.

199
0:15:58.340 --> 0:16:02.180
It's almost as if someone was threatening us with something violent, but it might just

200
0:16:02.180 --> 0:16:05.740
be changing our mindset or ideas.

201
0:16:05.740 --> 0:16:08.380
And what I'm going with this is that the change is really hard.

202
0:16:08.380 --> 0:16:15.020
And so we can help make it easier to evolve and adapt to change.

203
0:16:15.020 --> 0:16:24.180
So I think one part of this as well is that we're not also in a, you know, escape room

204
0:16:24.180 --> 0:16:25.980
or echo chamber doing this work.

205
0:16:25.980 --> 0:16:28.460
We're kind of all in this together.

206
0:16:28.460 --> 0:16:32.420
One of the data points to mention here as well is again, coming back to both the chaos

207
0:16:32.420 --> 0:16:37.420
Africa piece, which is where we had a lot of that newcomer growth was we had over 200,

208
0:16:37.420 --> 0:16:40.700
over 200 new community members who joined into our project.

209
0:16:40.700 --> 0:16:46.220
And that was across five different focus groups of development and design and research and

210
0:16:46.220 --> 0:16:48.180
technical writing and community management.

211
0:16:48.180 --> 0:16:53.020
I think it also ties into one of the efforts around our new website, which is underway

212
0:16:53.020 --> 0:16:57.820
for the chaos project, which has been a huge contribution from all these newcomers who

213
0:16:57.820 --> 0:17:02.780
have helped shape and influence how we're kind of opening or presenting the front door

214
0:17:02.780 --> 0:17:07.860
of our project and making it easier for people to find the things they're looking for.

215
0:17:07.860 --> 0:17:12.980
And also the over 900 plus folks following the new chaos Africa Twitter account as another

216
0:17:12.980 --> 0:17:15.140
data point.

217
0:17:15.140 --> 0:17:19.700
And our folks in the Asia Pacific community, there's also been a ongoing connection with

218
0:17:19.700 --> 0:17:23.700
the to do group supported by the Linux Foundation and GitHub.

219
0:17:23.700 --> 0:17:25.940
Or sorry, I misread that.

220
0:17:25.940 --> 0:17:31.420
So this they're doing work with the to do group around trying to support some of these

221
0:17:31.420 --> 0:17:34.100
efforts and grow the community there as well.

222
0:17:34.100 --> 0:17:39.500
So I think from here I will pass it over to Kristi to take us into the last two points

223
0:17:39.500 --> 0:17:44.140
of our what we're here to share with you today for the reflection.

224
0:17:44.140 --> 0:17:46.100
Great.

225
0:17:46.100 --> 0:17:50.300
Thank you, Justin.

226
0:17:50.300 --> 0:17:55.220
One other important, very important part of our community and one of the most successful

227
0:17:55.220 --> 0:17:59.100
initiatives, let's say, has been the badging.

228
0:17:59.100 --> 0:18:05.180
So the badging is meant the badging review is meant for self reflection and improvement

229
0:18:05.180 --> 0:18:12.140
on how many different communities and how many different conferences are implementing

230
0:18:12.140 --> 0:18:17.020
and are centering diversity, equity and inclusion.

231
0:18:17.020 --> 0:18:20.660
This initiative uses chaos matrix.

232
0:18:20.660 --> 0:18:28.420
And the way that it works is that we have an organizer of a conference applying on our

233
0:18:28.420 --> 0:18:29.420
website.

234
0:18:29.420 --> 0:18:31.060
We have two forms.

235
0:18:31.060 --> 0:18:38.420
One application is for all online events and the other application is for in person events.

236
0:18:38.420 --> 0:18:43.180
And the person who is applying actually goes through all the application, answers different

237
0:18:43.180 --> 0:18:44.180
questions.

238
0:18:44.180 --> 0:18:49.340
And we have two reviews, two reviewers that actually go through the application.

239
0:18:49.340 --> 0:18:56.540
And then by the end of the review, we also give the badge to the to the specific conference

240
0:18:56.540 --> 0:19:01.060
or the community that has applied for this.

241
0:19:01.060 --> 0:19:06.740
And it's also like this badging review has four different levels.

242
0:19:06.740 --> 0:19:11.900
And depending on how you're centering, we also give the reviews.

243
0:19:11.900 --> 0:19:18.580
In our community, we also give support and lessons learned from many people on how you

244
0:19:18.580 --> 0:19:24.820
can improve and how you can actually work more in your community to center diversity,

245
0:19:24.820 --> 0:19:31.220
equity and inclusion.

246
0:19:31.220 --> 0:19:37.140
Another initiative, let's say, in our community has been the survey.

247
0:19:37.140 --> 0:19:43.660
We started the community survey by October 20, 22nd.

248
0:19:43.660 --> 0:19:52.380
So in this survey, the idea was to get a general idea of how the experience of the community

249
0:19:52.380 --> 0:19:57.180
is going, what we are doing well, what needs more improvement.

250
0:19:57.180 --> 0:20:03.180
So by collecting all this data, we were able to work more on the things that we want to

251
0:20:03.180 --> 0:20:06.660
see more improved for the next years.

252
0:20:06.660 --> 0:20:12.140
The idea of this survey was to create a structure that could help also other communities to

253
0:20:12.140 --> 0:20:13.700
implement it.

254
0:20:13.700 --> 0:20:17.020
And we have asked many demographic questions.

255
0:20:17.020 --> 0:20:25.460
When the results will come out, we would like to give or to publicize this survey online

256
0:20:25.460 --> 0:20:32.460
with all the structures so everyone that would like to implement it in their respective communities,

257
0:20:32.460 --> 0:20:35.300
they can do so.

258
0:20:35.300 --> 0:20:37.540
It's a very demanding work.

259
0:20:37.540 --> 0:20:39.220
It takes a lot of energy and time.

260
0:20:39.220 --> 0:20:48.300
So we would love to give this work to others to make their lives better.

261
0:20:48.300 --> 0:21:00.500
And for a quick summary, so for our two years journey, there are definitely surprises going

262
0:21:00.500 --> 0:21:01.500
on.

263
0:21:01.500 --> 0:21:07.220
And we had things that we need to do during this whole process.

264
0:21:07.220 --> 0:21:11.900
So it's not, you know, sometimes things don't really go in the way that we have planned

265
0:21:11.900 --> 0:21:16.860
it, but the most important thing is to actually finish with the results that we wanted to

266
0:21:16.860 --> 0:21:22.180
and to accomplish the goals that we set ourselves to.

267
0:21:22.180 --> 0:21:27.460
Another main idea and another big lesson that we have learned throughout our journey is

268
0:21:27.460 --> 0:21:35.180
that supporting contributors and making onboarding process smooth actually helps us to have a

269
0:21:35.180 --> 0:21:42.180
better community, to have a healthier community, and to be able to get as many contributors

270
0:21:42.180 --> 0:21:44.380
as possible.

271
0:21:44.380 --> 0:21:51.020
And also the other last takeaway is that the community surveys are actually very important

272
0:21:51.020 --> 0:21:56.020
because it is a very good way to understand what is going on in your community, how can

273
0:21:56.020 --> 0:22:03.460
you help, and what other things that you can appreciate or that you can feel proud of,

274
0:22:03.460 --> 0:22:05.700
let's say.

275
0:22:05.700 --> 0:22:09.180
So this was all the presentation that we had for today.

276
0:22:09.180 --> 0:22:12.820
Thank you all for joining our talk.

277
0:22:12.820 --> 0:22:16.900
And feel free, if you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer you.

278
0:22:16.900 --> 0:22:17.900
Thank you.

279
0:22:17.900 --> 0:22:35.060
I'm going to put that QR code on the live survey.

280
0:22:35.060 --> 0:22:36.060
I'll do that.

281
0:22:36.060 --> 0:22:37.060
If I know how.

282
0:22:37.060 --> 0:22:38.060
Yeah, it gets got here.

283
0:22:38.060 --> 0:22:39.060
Yeah, can I?

284
0:22:39.060 --> 0:22:48.500
You can also upload the PDFs to the post-op site.

285
0:22:48.500 --> 0:22:49.500
Hi.

286
0:22:49.500 --> 0:22:51.500
Are you finished?

287
0:22:51.500 --> 0:22:52.500
What's that?

288
0:22:52.500 --> 0:22:53.500
Yeah.

289
0:22:53.500 --> 0:22:54.500
Are you finished?

290
0:22:54.500 --> 0:22:55.500
Yeah, we're done.

291
0:22:55.500 --> 0:22:56.500
Okay.

292
0:22:56.500 --> 0:22:57.500
Should we take any questions?

293
0:22:57.500 --> 0:22:59.500
So I think, yeah, we have about eight minutes left.

294
0:22:59.500 --> 0:23:02.540
Do we have, yeah, I see one question here from the audience.

295
0:23:02.540 --> 0:23:05.540
Yeah, it's an issue.

296
0:23:05.540 --> 0:23:10.940
Thanks, guys.

297
0:23:10.940 --> 0:23:15.180
It was a great talk and great insight.

298
0:23:15.180 --> 0:23:19.820
One of the questions that I had was, so you mentioned that improving the onboarding process

299
0:23:19.820 --> 0:23:24.340
made it easier to retain contributors down the line.

300
0:23:24.340 --> 0:23:31.300
Do you have any insight as to why you think that one might have contributed to the other?

301
0:23:31.300 --> 0:23:37.780
Because oftentimes I've seen in other projects where we've done work to help improve the

302
0:23:37.780 --> 0:23:44.140
on-ramps and we do see a large influx of people, but over time as well, there's still a fair

303
0:23:44.140 --> 0:23:45.300
amount of attrition.

304
0:23:45.300 --> 0:23:50.940
So I was just wondering what your insights were based on what you saw from the work you've

305
0:23:50.940 --> 0:23:51.940
done.

306
0:23:51.940 --> 0:23:52.940
Sure.

307
0:23:52.940 --> 0:23:53.940
Thanks.

308
0:23:53.940 --> 0:23:54.980
Yeah, thank you for that.

309
0:23:54.980 --> 0:24:01.580
So as far as a lot of our newcomer experience, I can tell you about a couple things that

310
0:24:01.580 --> 0:24:06.460
we've been doing just in that regard, and then I'll speak to kind of how I think it

311
0:24:06.460 --> 0:24:09.940
has helped retain people as well.

312
0:24:09.940 --> 0:24:14.100
So from the newcomer experience, a lot of the work that we have done are open office

313
0:24:14.100 --> 0:24:18.180
hours, which have worked really quite well.

314
0:24:18.180 --> 0:24:21.380
They're unstructured hours every week.

315
0:24:21.380 --> 0:24:27.740
We also have one hour a week of kind of structured talk about the project itself.

316
0:24:27.740 --> 0:24:33.300
So it's usually led by Ruth or by Elizabeth, who's the community manager, using a slide

317
0:24:33.300 --> 0:24:34.300
deck.

318
0:24:34.300 --> 0:24:35.300
You know what I mean?

319
0:24:35.300 --> 0:24:36.300
That's a little bit more structured in time.

320
0:24:36.300 --> 0:24:42.820
The other thing that we had to reflect on was in terms of the newcomer experience, for

321
0:24:42.820 --> 0:24:51.620
a lot of us, it was not actually going out as far as how to make a commit or how to do

322
0:24:51.620 --> 0:25:01.380
a PR, but they were usually easier things like, here's the meeting to attend, and we

323
0:25:01.380 --> 0:25:05.340
encourage you to attend this meeting twice.

324
0:25:05.340 --> 0:25:07.540
And this would be, say, our general meeting.

325
0:25:07.540 --> 0:25:11.740
And then once you've attended the general meeting twice, we encourage you to attend

326
0:25:11.740 --> 0:25:16.660
a working group meeting, kind of a smaller level meeting, say four times.

327
0:25:16.660 --> 0:25:26.820
And what we find is that by doing this, it helps create the vocabulary for folks to understand

328
0:25:26.820 --> 0:25:27.820
what it is.

329
0:25:27.820 --> 0:25:29.580
So sometimes the commit is kind of far out there.

330
0:25:29.580 --> 0:25:32.100
A poll request is kind of far out there.

331
0:25:32.100 --> 0:25:38.720
So in doing that, we also had a better opportunity to understand why people were joining.

332
0:25:38.720 --> 0:25:42.340
So it was kind of on us to understand why.

333
0:25:42.340 --> 0:25:46.860
And then the earlier talk about the different types of contributions, I don't know if you

334
0:25:46.860 --> 0:25:50.860
were here, there was one that was like not just technical contributions, but all the

335
0:25:50.860 --> 0:25:52.940
different types of contributions.

336
0:25:52.940 --> 0:25:59.540
It then becomes kind of our responsibility as the community folk, you know, like the

337
0:25:59.540 --> 0:26:07.660
community managers, to identify what those hopes are from people and how to contribute,

338
0:26:07.660 --> 0:26:10.900
and then really try to focus in on pairing that.

339
0:26:10.900 --> 0:26:13.420
So hopefully that helps a little bit.

340
0:26:13.420 --> 0:26:19.940
So it's not just putting out documents that are for the newcomer experience, but you have

341
0:26:19.940 --> 0:26:25.140
to be really active along that path as well.

342
0:26:25.140 --> 0:26:26.140
Did you want to comment, too?

343
0:26:26.140 --> 0:26:29.940
I'll just do one more callout to something that I thought worked really well in this

344
0:26:29.940 --> 0:26:30.940
as well.

345
0:26:30.940 --> 0:26:33.140
It was Elizabeth Barron, I think, Ruth, too.

346
0:26:33.140 --> 0:26:37.820
We're doing kind of like individualized like mentor sessions with folks who wanted like

347
0:26:37.820 --> 0:26:41.900
some extra guidance or had questions and weren't really sure where to go.

348
0:26:41.900 --> 0:26:46.900
Talking to a real human being and getting some of that individualized support, I think,

349
0:26:46.900 --> 0:26:50.400
also made it easier for folks to feel connected to the project.

350
0:26:50.400 --> 0:26:55.020
And so when things got hard or things weren't clear, there was always a way that they could

351
0:26:55.020 --> 0:26:58.420
they had like kind of a buddy in the community to help kind of help them through.

352
0:26:58.420 --> 0:27:03.580
And I think that was also kind of a big part of the retention piece.

353
0:27:03.580 --> 0:27:10.420
I also think that an important part of the onboarding process and to make it as easier

354
0:27:10.420 --> 0:27:16.580
as possible is to also have a good documentation on how people at least can get started.

355
0:27:16.580 --> 0:27:21.580
And by having some very specific steps, it makes people more comfortable and it makes

356
0:27:21.580 --> 0:27:25.340
people feel that they know where they're actually going.

357
0:27:25.340 --> 0:27:30.940
So having actionable items helps you with the path forward.

358
0:27:30.940 --> 0:27:36.580
Do we have other questions for our fine speakers?

359
0:27:36.580 --> 0:27:38.580
We have about three minutes.

360
0:27:38.580 --> 0:27:39.580
How many?

361
0:27:39.580 --> 0:27:40.580
Three minutes.

362
0:27:40.580 --> 0:27:41.580
Three seconds.

363
0:27:41.580 --> 0:27:43.580
Ah, I see.

364
0:27:43.580 --> 0:27:52.820
Is it helpful to have an onboarding buddy for each person, a mentor for their first

365
0:27:52.820 --> 0:27:54.300
stage?

366
0:27:54.300 --> 0:27:59.780
I think that assigning someone specific to every new commerce may be a little bit too

367
0:27:59.780 --> 0:28:05.860
demanding because there might be like a certain amount of people coming all at the same time

368
0:28:05.860 --> 0:28:10.700
and maybe we don't have the manpower to assist each one with an individual mentor.

369
0:28:10.700 --> 0:28:15.260
But I think that having one mentor for three or four people, for a set group of people,

370
0:28:15.260 --> 0:28:22.660
would be easier to coordinate and to organize.

371
0:28:22.660 --> 0:28:23.660
It's a good question.

372
0:28:23.660 --> 0:28:29.300
I don't think we've sorted it out yet, but in terms of having a one-on-one, to Christie's

373
0:28:29.300 --> 0:28:32.500
point would be a lot of work.

374
0:28:32.500 --> 0:28:37.380
So how we sort that out, I don't think we have that quite clear yet.

375
0:28:37.380 --> 0:28:42.260
Maybe just one corollary point to that is I think in Fedora, we have also like a join

376
0:28:42.260 --> 0:28:45.300
special interest group of folks who kind of buddy up with folks.

377
0:28:45.300 --> 0:28:49.340
I think what's helped with that to make it scale is that there's a process that anyone

378
0:28:49.340 --> 0:28:53.480
who wants to even do that mentoring work knows how they can help people.

379
0:28:53.480 --> 0:28:57.820
So it makes it easier not just for newcomers to find someone to get kind of help buddy

380
0:28:57.820 --> 0:29:01.860
up with them, but there's also a way for the people who want to be buddies to help connect

381
0:29:01.860 --> 0:29:02.860
with the newcomers too.

382
0:29:02.860 --> 0:29:07.660
So I think that might be one way to help make it easier to scale because one-to-one is,

383
0:29:07.660 --> 0:29:12.260
it only goes, it only reach, can go so far with that before you hit your limit.

384
0:29:12.260 --> 0:29:18.140
Anyone else have a question for our wonderful presenters?

385
0:29:18.140 --> 0:29:19.140
Very good.

386
0:29:19.140 --> 0:29:20.140
On my way.

387
0:29:20.140 --> 0:29:29.620
Hi.

388
0:29:29.620 --> 0:29:38.700
I was wondering if after the two years of research, do you review your metrics process to have

389
0:29:38.700 --> 0:29:44.140
another understanding what does health in the community mean?

390
0:29:44.140 --> 0:29:46.380
Yeah.

391
0:29:46.380 --> 0:29:49.100
So as part of this process.

392
0:29:49.100 --> 0:29:52.100
So the CAS project also publishes metrics.

393
0:29:52.100 --> 0:29:56.880
So as part of what we're learning, that's going right into the development of new metrics.

394
0:29:56.880 --> 0:30:01.700
So that would be the publishing that we're doing in part.

395
0:30:01.700 --> 0:30:12.060
I think we're also in the stage right now of how we.
