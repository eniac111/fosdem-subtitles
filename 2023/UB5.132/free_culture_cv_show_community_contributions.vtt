00:00.000 --> 00:11.640
I am now going to get out of Pablo's way so that he can begin his excellent presentation.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
Thank you for being here, Pablo.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.640
Thank you.

00:13.640 --> 00:18.640
Will you give Pablo a round of applause?

00:18.640 --> 00:19.640
Okay.

00:19.640 --> 00:32.080
Hello, my name is Pablo.

00:32.080 --> 00:40.600
Okay, I'm going to talk about the frequent OCD, okay, as an open source idea to show

00:40.600 --> 00:43.880
the community your contributions, okay?

00:43.880 --> 00:50.760
And the first question is, you have to think yourself, does your OCD follow one standard,

00:50.760 --> 00:51.760
okay?

00:51.760 --> 00:58.120
And the main goal of this talk, okay, is to create a community to give a project to solve

00:58.120 --> 01:00.160
the main question, okay?

01:00.160 --> 01:05.600
The community has already started on that link, so feel free to go there.

01:05.600 --> 01:14.960
And the question is, how do we show our contributions to the free culture communities?

01:14.960 --> 01:23.080
Okay, in my opinion, we need like a free culture OCD and we will talk about it.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.680
This talk is not to show a project, okay?

01:25.680 --> 01:31.720
It's not a demo and it's not to show the latest updates of something.

01:31.720 --> 01:43.000
This talk is to discuss about the creation of an open OCD standard, to get more environmental

01:43.000 --> 01:49.960
sustainability within papers, and to show how and where to collaborate, okay?

01:49.960 --> 01:56.200
Because the thing is, if you have our profile with the communities that we are contributing

01:56.200 --> 02:04.000
to, if someone sees our profile, you can find out more communities that maybe you don't

02:04.000 --> 02:06.320
know, okay?

02:06.320 --> 02:12.720
So the main goal, as I said, is to create a community and improve the relationship between

02:12.720 --> 02:20.000
the candidates and the regulators, because this relationship currently, I guess, needs

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
to improve.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.880
So one important thing is to have more control over your personal data, okay?

02:27.880 --> 02:31.200
We will see.

02:31.200 --> 02:37.080
This talk is based on four parts.

02:37.080 --> 02:45.760
The first part is a comparison between the 20th century OCD, like the old CVs, and the

02:45.760 --> 02:52.240
20th century CVs, the CVs that we want to create today.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.600
Then we will see the current standard that we in the European Union, we currently have.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.960
As you will see, it's going to be amazing.

03:02.960 --> 03:13.280
Then we will see more about my identity, like the idea of my free-code OCD.

03:13.280 --> 03:20.280
And then we will see things for inspiration in the community to create, to discuss, to

03:20.280 --> 03:24.800
decide, and to build that community.

03:24.800 --> 03:33.320
Okay first, the old CVs are usually not standard, okay?

03:33.320 --> 03:40.200
So each one has a different template, and this is a mess.

03:40.200 --> 03:46.200
We currently have an European standard, but this should be the input.

03:46.200 --> 03:54.640
Linked-in is, we don't want to be at the standard, you know, because currently it has a lot of

03:54.640 --> 03:58.040
users, but it's not the way I think.

03:58.040 --> 04:06.760
And on the other hand, we need to create a standard TV to get all the benefits of the

04:06.760 --> 04:15.240
standard things in terms of the format, the fields, and the features that our CVs should

04:15.240 --> 04:18.400
have.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.640
Then the old CVs are static.

04:21.640 --> 04:28.800
So we have a CV, we print it, and each time you get a new job, you have to create like

04:28.800 --> 04:31.800
a new version or whatever.

04:31.800 --> 04:39.720
So sometimes it happens that our creator asks you, hey, I have your CV, but it's not the

04:39.720 --> 04:40.920
latest one, okay?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.220
So I need the latest one.

04:43.220 --> 04:51.840
So we want that our CV, the 21st century CV, should be dynamic, okay?

04:51.840 --> 04:59.960
Should be a link where, okay, this is my identity, this is my profile, my CV, and then you each

04:59.960 --> 05:02.440
time is referenced by itself.

05:02.440 --> 05:07.880
I mean, you don't have a file that you have to update.

05:07.880 --> 05:15.000
And instead of being asked about, hey, please send you the CV, my link is here, and it will

05:15.000 --> 05:23.080
be always there.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.880
The current CVs, okay, are not searchable and not indexable, okay?

05:27.880 --> 05:36.600
So when the creators have tons of CVs, it's difficult to search inside the papers, and

05:36.600 --> 05:42.840
it's hard to find CVs because they are just papers, you know?

05:42.840 --> 05:50.480
So for example, it's a problem for the recruiters how to find that people between the older

05:50.480 --> 05:55.640
CVs that they have who has a Linux skills, for example.

05:55.640 --> 06:00.080
There is no way because they are just papers.

06:00.080 --> 06:09.920
And so the CV that we want must be searchable and indexable, so our recruiter can say, okay,

06:09.920 --> 06:16.160
please, show me the people with Linux skills, okay?

06:16.160 --> 06:21.240
Current CVs don't have validations, no configurations.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.120
So I can say I am a Harvard student.

06:24.120 --> 06:32.040
I put on my CV, and it's supposed that I am a Harvard student, but I'm not, you know?

06:32.040 --> 06:43.320
So we need a CVs, validable and configurable, with APIs, with links, with whatever, to validate

06:43.320 --> 06:49.040
that the information that we are providing is true, okay?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.640
And then a paper, okay?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.960
We are our current CVs.

06:53.960 --> 07:04.680
Now we are using the PDF, you know, but the paper, it has a problem, and it's how we show

07:04.680 --> 07:10.640
how do we show the multimedia information, right?

07:10.640 --> 07:17.520
We have to create a multimedia CV where we can add our portfolio, our videos, our pictures,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.360
and whatever.

07:19.360 --> 07:28.480
So we get a better portfolio, our CV is not going to trust, because sometimes due to data

07:28.480 --> 07:38.720
protection rights, you have to drop to the CVs, and we get a happy environment, because

07:38.720 --> 07:41.960
we need to, okay?

07:41.960 --> 07:47.840
The second part is the amazing WordPress journey, and as I said, currently we have an open standard

07:47.840 --> 07:56.640
CV that is named E

07:56.640 --> 08:00.480
Uropas, and it's the E Uropan commission project.

08:00.480 --> 08:08.040
So this is starting like this, and I don't know if you can see it, oh, okay.

08:08.040 --> 08:16.800
Looked at it, it's a micro support template, so as you can imagine, this is going to be

08:16.800 --> 08:23.800
...

08:23.800 --> 08:29.800
...

08:29.800 --> 08:34.800
...

08:34.800 --> 08:45.800
As you can see, this is not the way, you know, everyone should feel the E Uropas CV, but it's

08:45.800 --> 08:53.800
a nice list of standard things that a CV should have, you know?

08:53.800 --> 08:59.800
So we will see negative things, but also positive things, okay?

08:59.800 --> 09:07.800
A good idea is to add additional information with your publications, your presentations,

09:07.800 --> 09:09.800
and so on.

09:09.800 --> 09:16.800
But I guess just, it's not enough to show that, you know, maybe I'm linked to the presentation

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
or the event, you know?

09:18.800 --> 09:26.800
And also maybe I can say that I was on the whatever conference, and who knows that it's

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
true, you know?

09:27.800 --> 09:30.640
It's hard to find out that.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.560
So we need another way to feel the E Uropas CV, okay?

09:35.560 --> 09:50.560
The E Uropas started in 2024, I don't know, but the thing is that they realized that they

09:50.560 --> 09:51.560
need a portpad, okay?

09:51.560 --> 10:01.800
Because the word template was not enough, and nobody was feeling the CV.

10:01.800 --> 10:06.800
So they create an E Uropas portpad, okay, and let's see the simulation journey where

10:06.800 --> 10:13.480
you are feeling your personal information, then you have your work experience, and you

10:13.480 --> 10:16.680
feel your personal skills.

10:16.680 --> 10:22.920
For example, one personal skill important is the language, okay?

10:22.920 --> 10:24.560
It should be also standard.

10:24.560 --> 10:32.800
There is a current European standard, and you have your digital skills, and there are

10:32.800 --> 10:39.280
suggestions when you are feeling the digital skills, and as you can see, all this is Microsoft

10:39.280 --> 10:44.000
Office digital skill, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.480
I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but many Microsoft things, as you can see, and

10:51.480 --> 10:57.080
I said, okay, I'm going to feel all of them because I'm a practical engineer, you know,

10:57.080 --> 11:00.800
and let's feel all of them.

11:00.800 --> 11:09.080
And then another suggestion started, okay, and as you can see, soon, okay, it's my digital

11:09.080 --> 11:12.320
skill, then Outlook instead of email.

11:12.320 --> 11:21.880
Google, Facebook as an important digital skill on your city.

11:21.880 --> 11:32.240
PowerPoint, okay, and then it started, I feel all of them again, and then some, it turns

11:32.240 --> 11:44.000
to more personal skills like motivated teamwork, and with the skills, and I said, I'm going

11:44.000 --> 11:50.200
to keep continuing with my feeling all of them, and then the amazing digital skill,

11:50.200 --> 11:55.560
I am an internet user, all right?

11:55.560 --> 12:04.960
So this is my CV, as you can see, I am a pretty amazing engineer.

12:04.960 --> 12:10.240
And suddenly I saw, oh, I can create a CV based on this information, this is what I

12:10.240 --> 12:17.880
want, I want to create my CV with my profile, okay, so you feel, again, some information,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.320
let's feel a professional CV.

12:20.320 --> 12:27.080
You can add the statement at the bottom of your CV, and I started to add, we will see

12:27.080 --> 12:33.520
later on, but I started to add all my free culture profiles, I don't know why, but I

12:33.520 --> 12:36.200
want that information in there, okay?

12:36.200 --> 12:41.280
We will see later on the reason.

12:41.280 --> 12:51.440
I created, okay, and there is another feature, it's that you can upload it to AWS network,

12:51.440 --> 12:59.760
okay, this is the most positive thing about the WordPress, and it's like AWS, it's like

12:59.760 --> 13:06.000
a shared network between the European Union countries, where people from other countries

13:06.000 --> 13:13.160
can ask for CV for other countries, and if they are available, you can see their CV,

13:13.160 --> 13:23.520
okay, so a common database, I think it's a good idea, but I don't know if AWS is used,

13:23.520 --> 13:33.960
you can check which countries are you willing to work at, you can feed your occupation,

13:33.960 --> 13:42.280
suddenly, okay, my CV is on AWS, so I don't know if that is sending my live app, it's

13:42.280 --> 13:47.480
there, I have the open question if it's a good idea, just to discuss on the community,

13:47.480 --> 13:59.800
okay, but it's a good idea to have an European Union shared CV database, and then this is

13:59.800 --> 14:05.240
to bring show up that it's tell your digitalest case, so as you can imagine before, let's

14:05.240 --> 14:10.160
see this, I mean same thing, I don't know if you can see the questions, but it is like

14:10.160 --> 14:16.600
a self test, I'm able to do this, I'm able to do this, I'm able to do this, okay, it's

14:16.600 --> 14:27.180
a test, then some question that that are great, you know, but the first one is based on some

14:27.180 --> 14:34.020
software and the other one I don't know if it's important to know for an

14:34.020 --> 14:44.340
employer but how many digits the Apple code has. So then I finished my test

14:44.340 --> 14:55.700
they say congratulations and I am an advanced user. Okay so as you can see I

14:55.700 --> 15:06.540
got the highest level and you can generate like a proof that you got that

15:06.540 --> 15:12.580
level. Okay actually they are asking for my name I don't know why because I was

15:12.580 --> 15:24.260
already loving it but it's funny because my label C except band report is also

15:24.260 --> 15:34.900
beyond also to lean on the board. Okay you can type another name and it's okay and

15:34.900 --> 15:40.700
then there is a little bit of roadmap but I don't know why I got this level but I

15:40.700 --> 15:46.580
got the I am a master of remote work really I don't know how they tested that

15:46.580 --> 15:56.620
but I'm and this is my person is he okay you bet I mean this is my opinion this

15:56.620 --> 16:01.740
is an important thing and a cool thing but as you can see the other steps

16:01.740 --> 16:07.900
through the improve. Okay and then the third part is my identity okay my name

16:07.900 --> 16:16.280
is Paulino Khosa. Thanks for the cause mention the cause community mention the

16:16.280 --> 16:23.500
talk before in ESA and we will see the parts that are free to see the issue

16:23.500 --> 16:30.220
must have okay most of them are like a normal CD but the most important thing

16:30.220 --> 16:41.120
is the matrix the I want a CD where you are able to see matrix about the

16:41.120 --> 16:46.140
contributions that to free portal communities that you have done okay

16:46.140 --> 16:52.540
because for equators it's important to know the profile to know how activities

16:52.540 --> 17:05.580
are on how active the the person is on on the frequent or community and I mean

17:05.580 --> 17:12.300
it's in my opinion it shows many information about our identity on how

17:12.300 --> 17:21.980
the way we we work. One of the most important things in in your community in

17:21.980 --> 17:32.460
your CD is your identity okay it's hard to to implement an identity start where

17:32.460 --> 17:39.220
an open identity start and we have two options the first one is key base okay

17:39.220 --> 17:47.020
I suppose that it's well known here it's as a pro it's open source it's privacy

17:47.020 --> 17:54.780
and security focused and it's easy to install okay but as a con it's type of

17:54.780 --> 18:01.380
confirmation and must be developed okay because we will say that

18:01.380 --> 18:09.060
as I said the confirmation it's important to to give trustness to our

18:09.060 --> 18:15.940
CD okay another concept that the server is not open source is not widely used

18:15.940 --> 18:25.980
and it's not focused only on online identity okay so the other one the other

18:25.980 --> 18:34.260
way to create your identity that I prefer that it's key upside that we will

18:34.260 --> 18:45.540
see Aladdin talk later on at 1 p.m. as you can see this is the the Yarmul profile

18:45.540 --> 18:55.740
and this is one of the most important slides because my identity it's my DNA

18:55.740 --> 19:04.100
so my the DNS of my website my github profile my good luck profile and whatever

19:04.100 --> 19:10.300
community you know and I want the most important thing is to generate metrics

19:10.300 --> 19:17.060
about the contributions that using my my community profile let's say you love or

19:17.060 --> 19:25.060
or get help or whatever another thing is the work experience okay we have to have

19:25.060 --> 19:31.780
a list with the companies you have worked out description and the

19:31.780 --> 19:37.980
possibility to add validations that that is to worry and also the recommendations

19:37.980 --> 19:43.020
in terms of education and it's and training is almost the same list of

19:43.020 --> 19:47.500
course description of the content and possibility of the validations for

19:47.500 --> 19:54.620
example I read had certified so that provides a workplace where do you submit

19:54.620 --> 20:02.100
the identity of the certification and work address okay there that person is

20:02.100 --> 20:11.060
certified it's true that what is what are they saying then about the skills I

20:11.060 --> 20:16.860
suppose that it should be mostly free text and we give a multimedia and we

20:16.860 --> 20:25.020
also need validations and this is a list of some of my profile in some communities

20:25.020 --> 20:32.420
you know so we are going to for example this is my profile so I need a way to

20:32.420 --> 20:38.700
get metrics of my contributions to the we can make it we can make a environment

20:38.700 --> 20:48.620
let's say so for example I have a hundred forty image in open street maps

20:48.620 --> 20:56.220
I made a 49 edits as you can see in my profile on open street maps you already

20:56.220 --> 21:03.260
you already have a way to have to get the metrics of the job contributions okay

21:03.260 --> 21:11.700
here you can see some statistics about the internal statistics about my open

21:11.700 --> 21:16.060
street map contributions then you get graphs that the problem is that the

21:16.060 --> 21:20.460
platform that I'm using is not open source you know so the community should

21:20.460 --> 21:28.020
be another way to get that data and to show metrics and to to tell more about

21:28.020 --> 21:35.180
our contributions okay then this is my GitHub profile and I'm already including

21:35.180 --> 21:45.140
metrics inside my GitHub my GitHub profile and there are several ways to

21:45.140 --> 21:53.820
to get those metrics okay the first one is the GitHub really starts project that

21:53.820 --> 22:02.380
it's pretty popular it's more than 51 K half stars and you get the metrics about

22:02.380 --> 22:07.100
your contributions and also that you're the most used language which is this

22:07.100 --> 22:12.620
information is pretty useful for the degree to survey because it tells more

22:12.620 --> 22:20.460
about us that okay I go to the interview and I say I'm an amazing PHP developer

22:20.460 --> 22:26.220
but if then we show your contributions are your contributions are not so good

22:26.220 --> 22:35.100
maybe they they get their recruiters get more information about that another

22:35.100 --> 22:43.140
platform is metrics like up the dial where you can see some statistics and

22:43.140 --> 22:50.780
on the latest version there are pretty cool graphs and things that more or less

22:50.780 --> 23:00.220
are true but as I said we have to to get that information basically from what they

23:00.220 --> 23:07.980
give half API and and provide them in another way another it's web latte that I

23:07.980 --> 23:14.500
got 62 translations you know but and maybe for a for a recruiter of

23:14.500 --> 23:20.420
translator maybe it's important it's how activities on this community that it's

23:20.420 --> 23:28.540
based on its focus it on translations you know and on gird lab I have

23:28.540 --> 23:36.300
contributed mostly in my work 260 project and again we have to find a way

23:36.300 --> 23:44.340
to get this kind of metrics in open foot fat for to survive product and I'm at

23:44.340 --> 23:48.940
code that okay I'm a starter I have started the free quarter city that is

23:48.940 --> 23:59.020
the repository of the the community that I want to build finally a the last part

23:59.020 --> 24:06.060
is the things for inspiration and the first thing is that we already have a

24:06.060 --> 24:15.140
open CV format but it's made by the Spanish recruiters company but it's

24:15.140 --> 24:23.740
based on the Asian of a and this could be the first point for inspiration then

24:23.740 --> 24:31.200
we have to be old we have to create see builders we have here I left for

24:31.200 --> 24:38.940
examples of open source projects that led you to create your CV based on your

24:38.940 --> 24:46.700
guitar profile okay and you got the you enter your information and you get the

24:46.700 --> 24:55.140
your CV in several ways a PDF what page or whatever then one of the most

24:55.140 --> 25:05.580
important things that we have to develop extractors and converters and to we need

25:05.580 --> 25:15.140
the structures to get the information for the the API to to then show them and

25:15.140 --> 25:20.060
we have to create converters to make the life easier for the people that they

25:20.060 --> 25:25.660
have a link in profile and we need a converter for longer your link link it

25:25.660 --> 25:32.860
in CV to the job free quarter CV or maybe a translator to all the pass or I

25:32.860 --> 25:39.300
mean we have to provide ways to avoid just feeling again the information

25:39.300 --> 25:50.220
because I already put in another platform and a list of things that we

25:50.220 --> 25:56.700
should talk about is the ethical things you know that the protection about the

25:56.700 --> 26:06.080
protection for example in Spain many people put the street the street they

26:06.080 --> 26:12.140
read this on the CV I don't know if it's useful or not but for example in the UK

26:12.140 --> 26:19.280
is not possible to add your profile you're a picture of yourself and another

26:19.280 --> 26:26.220
ethical things that do I think we should discuss we have to choose a backend how

26:26.220 --> 26:31.260
they we extract of the information I see it's our past maybe the error passes

26:31.260 --> 26:39.780
that is way to start or maybe we have to sell develop another option then we

26:39.780 --> 26:46.740
have to make a decision if we should have a CV public database if it's always

26:46.740 --> 26:54.420
maybe the project itself it's the best way or the best the place for example

26:54.420 --> 27:04.520
the key oxide is using just your GPD key so maybe that's enough and we have to

27:04.520 --> 27:12.820
provide a way to to allow to share our personal data okay first but maybe we

27:12.820 --> 27:20.620
don't want to add to our CV the the the contact but if a recruiter is asking a

27:20.620 --> 27:26.780
PPA send me your email your phone maybe you we need a way to okay I'm going to I

27:26.780 --> 27:36.580
want to provide this information to this operator then would be important and the

27:36.580 --> 27:43.660
last one is if we should provide virtual compatibility to the old CV okay so we

27:43.660 --> 27:50.780
feel all the information in our amazing a free culture CD but maybe the old

27:50.780 --> 27:57.380
recruiters let's say they need the old CDs I don't know why and maybe to a CV

27:57.380 --> 28:05.140
that could be a printable is a PDF export the best a PDF it's it's important

28:05.140 --> 28:12.140
and obviously we will find another questions on the way and we so let's

28:12.140 --> 28:17.660
start the community and let's discuss that this is the best attempt that I have

28:17.660 --> 28:26.060
seen about the free culture or CV focused on the brokers okay the problem

28:26.060 --> 28:33.540
is that the repo it is already on you have and it's pretty popular but the

28:33.540 --> 28:42.300
webpage is not working so maybe a four but I don't know but there you can show

28:42.300 --> 28:53.620
your developers case so here we see metrics about our

28:53.620 --> 29:01.020
internet our profile let's say the technologies that we use funny facts

29:01.020 --> 29:07.300
and our personal repositories for example I like a lot the idea and it's

29:07.300 --> 29:15.020
more or less the CV that I would like to know to have and finally take home

29:15.020 --> 29:19.900
message okay we have many reasons to improve the way that we are creating

29:19.900 --> 29:28.740
cities as you saw before we need to create a the newest standard and the

29:28.740 --> 29:33.900
newest and that must be community developed because it seems I don't know

29:33.900 --> 29:39.740
I'm not sure but it seems that Microsoft for example took part on the

29:39.740 --> 29:47.660
auto pass the definition which have to show metrics about our collaboration so

29:47.660 --> 29:53.300
if you are interested and you think this is important please join us about

29:53.300 --> 30:00.380
community and less discuss and less to be on something that I think it's

30:00.380 --> 30:07.220
affects to everyone and it's important for us as a community and also as a

30:07.220 --> 30:15.420
person they open sources stuff and the open culture stuff so thank you

30:15.420 --> 30:26.260
I think this thing is on this thing is on thank you so much Pablo
