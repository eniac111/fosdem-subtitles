1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.720
So you are almost having like asynchronous Q&A session.

2
0:00:09.720 --> 0:00:14.320
And I, you know, that just makes life easier for a lot of people, including presenters,

3
0:00:14.320 --> 0:00:15.320
right?

4
0:00:15.320 --> 0:00:17.720
Because you know what to sort of expect.

5
0:00:17.720 --> 0:00:22.480
The last one is sort of similar.

6
0:00:22.480 --> 0:00:27.320
I saw this, like, Linux Foundation did this like a few years ago.

7
0:00:27.320 --> 0:00:32.160
I made a presentation, again, with Sophia on documentation.

8
0:00:32.160 --> 0:00:36.360
And then there was like a Slack channel for Q&A's.

9
0:00:36.360 --> 0:00:40.120
And after our presentation, we were on there for like 30, 45 minutes, which I thought was

10
0:00:40.120 --> 0:00:41.120
great.

11
0:00:41.120 --> 0:00:45.440
Because typically, like when you're at a convention center, you kind of get shoot out after your

12
0:00:45.440 --> 0:00:46.440
presentation.

13
0:00:46.440 --> 0:00:50.320
So people only have like a five minute window to ask you questions, like if you ran out

14
0:00:50.320 --> 0:00:51.680
of time, right?

15
0:00:51.680 --> 0:00:56.440
This just gave us a lot more time to answer questions.

16
0:00:56.440 --> 0:01:00.640
And also for people to be, you know, vocal with their comments and feedback, which I

17
0:01:00.640 --> 0:01:01.640
thought was great.

18
0:01:01.640 --> 0:01:07.640
And I made sure that I let a lot of people know that I thought that was pretty awesome.

19
0:01:07.640 --> 0:01:11.040
So I know I'm almost out of time.

20
0:01:11.040 --> 0:01:14.040
So I think I've covered most of these.

21
0:01:14.040 --> 0:01:16.600
So it's not either or.

22
0:01:16.600 --> 0:01:21.760
The virtual events can complement what you're doing, like, in person.

23
0:01:21.760 --> 0:01:25.480
And you know, just remember that we've been doing like a virtual collaboration for a long

24
0:01:25.480 --> 0:01:26.480
time.

25
0:01:26.480 --> 0:01:30.920
And this is definitely an important toolkit to help community members.

26
0:01:30.920 --> 0:01:36.400
And then especially for people who can't always travel for whatever reason, financial or otherwise.

27
0:01:36.400 --> 0:01:43.920
And the final point I want to make, actually, we did platforms that we're using for online

28
0:01:43.920 --> 0:01:45.840
events, like including Hoppin.

29
0:01:45.840 --> 0:01:50.680
I mean, I'm not saying that's my favorite tool, but even Hoppin has really evolved over

30
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:51.680
time.

31
0:01:51.680 --> 0:01:56.320
And one of the things I noticed when I talked to event manager and vendors is that they'll

32
0:01:56.320 --> 0:02:00.520
give a list of here the virtual event platforms that we support.

33
0:02:00.520 --> 0:02:04.800
One company, they provided like 15 logos, including like Hoppin.

34
0:02:04.800 --> 0:02:08.280
So there are just more alternatives available.

35
0:02:08.280 --> 0:02:12.920
So I think we have better platforms and tools to run events virtually.

36
0:02:12.920 --> 0:02:15.640
And yeah, I just I think that's it.

37
0:02:15.640 --> 0:02:18.200
I just want to make sure I have time for questions.

38
0:02:18.200 --> 0:02:21.160
Hopefully you were able to hear me out there.

39
0:02:21.160 --> 0:02:27.360
Great, because it's you, you can do one question, even though we're over time, because we think

40
0:02:27.360 --> 0:02:28.360
you're awesome.

41
0:02:28.360 --> 0:02:29.360
All right, thank you.

42
0:02:29.360 --> 0:02:31.040
Anyone want to ask a question?

43
0:02:31.040 --> 0:02:32.600
I see a hand.

44
0:02:32.600 --> 0:02:34.080
Off we go.

45
0:02:34.080 --> 0:02:39.720
You are the final question of the community, Deborah, for FOSDAM 2023.

46
0:02:39.720 --> 0:02:40.720
Congratulations.

47
0:02:40.720 --> 0:02:44.480
Well, thank you very much for the talk.

48
0:02:44.480 --> 0:02:50.640
We have a global market, but obviously we don't have big resources like big companies.

49
0:02:50.640 --> 0:02:58.120
So I wonder how much it is to put up with not to set up the whole logistic of the virtual

50
0:02:58.120 --> 0:03:00.360
event live streaming.

51
0:03:00.360 --> 0:03:03.640
Yeah, because we definitely have a global market.

52
0:03:03.640 --> 0:03:09.760
So obviously you can't be relying on everyone assistant to your event if you do it in person.

53
0:03:09.760 --> 0:03:16.960
But I'm thinking probably best thing is to just record it and then put it available online

54
0:03:16.960 --> 0:03:22.040
a week later or something like that, rather than having to live stream it as a proper

55
0:03:22.040 --> 0:03:23.040
hybrid event.

56
0:03:23.040 --> 0:03:24.040
What do you think?

57
0:03:24.040 --> 0:03:30.240
Yeah, well, I mean, so the question for people online, you know, because even Zoom is not

58
0:03:30.240 --> 0:03:31.840
free, right?

59
0:03:31.840 --> 0:03:36.560
And then, you know, is it okay to sort of, you know, prerecord things and make content

60
0:03:36.560 --> 0:03:40.360
available for people to like consume and ask questions to?

61
0:03:40.360 --> 0:03:41.760
I think that's completely valid.

62
0:03:41.760 --> 0:03:47.080
Actually, one of the things I learned from these vendors, they don't, on a virtual platform,

63
0:03:47.080 --> 0:03:51.080
they actually don't encourage you to have like a live presentation and a Q&A because

64
0:03:51.080 --> 0:03:54.120
there's just a lot more technical difficulty you can run through.

65
0:03:54.120 --> 0:03:56.720
So they call it senior lives.

66
0:03:56.720 --> 0:04:04.240
They prefer that they have the presenter record and be available for 10 minutes of questioning

67
0:04:04.240 --> 0:04:05.240
as an example.

68
0:04:05.240 --> 0:04:09.720
But, you know, if you don't want to have person available 10 minutes online for questioning,

69
0:04:09.720 --> 0:04:14.640
you can still have like a creative Google Doc, like here's a recording, please submit

70
0:04:14.640 --> 0:04:19.760
your questions over this period of time and the presenter or other people can answer them.

71
0:04:19.760 --> 0:04:21.440
So there's all documented, right?

72
0:04:21.440 --> 0:04:23.920
So I think that's completely valid.

73
0:04:23.920 --> 0:04:24.920
So you don't have to use Zoom.

74
0:04:24.920 --> 0:04:29.320
I mean, I just happened to be, I've been using Zoom for the past few years so that's what

75
0:04:29.320 --> 0:04:34.000
I'm comfortable with, but you can do live streaming from Google Hangout.

76
0:04:34.000 --> 0:04:38.120
I haven't tried it hands on myself, but I know it's doable.

77
0:04:38.120 --> 0:04:39.600
So that's an option.

78
0:04:39.600 --> 0:04:44.600
By having something prerecorded available on YouTube channel, but here's a documentation,

79
0:04:44.600 --> 0:04:48.640
it could be a Wiki page or Google Docs, please submit your questions.

80
0:04:48.640 --> 0:04:52.920
We'll close the questioning in like seven days and, you know, whoever the presenter

81
0:04:52.920 --> 0:04:57.440
was, whoever the content expert is, we'll get back to you with their answers.

82
0:04:57.440 --> 0:04:59.680
So I think that's a completely valid thing to do.

83
0:04:59.680 --> 0:05:11.720
It doesn't have to be like 100% interactive.
