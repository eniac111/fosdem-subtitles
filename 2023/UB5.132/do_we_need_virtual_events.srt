1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.000
Thank you so much, Ray.

2
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:12.000
Can we get a round of applause for Ray, please?

3
0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:13.000
Thank you.

4
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:17.000
You figured something would go wrong, but this was resolved pretty quickly.

5
0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:20.000
So thanks for sticking around.

6
0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:22.000
Last session of the dev room.

7
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:28.000
It's really good to be back in person, and I realize the irony of talking about virtual events when we're all together,

8
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:32.000
but bear with me.

9
0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:34.000
So my name is Ray Paik.

10
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:37.000
Currently, we have a community at CUBE.

11
0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:41.000
If you're not familiar with CUBE, we're in the semantic layer space of data analytics.

12
0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:45.000
So if you want to find out more, check out our website at cube.dev.

13
0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:48.000
And you can, for now, I'm still on Twitter.

14
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:51.000
I'm like a lot of people trying to figure out what to do with Twitter,

15
0:00:51.000 --> 0:00:57.000
but you can reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn or other social platforms where you can find me.

16
0:00:57.000 --> 0:01:04.000
And if you came to my session like three years ago in 2020, back then I was working at GitLab,

17
0:01:04.000 --> 0:01:07.000
where I also done a lot of virtual activities.

18
0:01:07.000 --> 0:01:12.000
So in addition to having a lot of experience along with all of you with virtual events,

19
0:01:12.000 --> 0:01:21.000
I went to sort of share what we all collectively learned about getting together in virtual formats.

20
0:01:21.000 --> 0:01:29.000
So what we'll talk about is, I mean, first of all, I wanted to sort of step back and talk about why we even have events in open source.

21
0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:35.000
I mean, a lot of us are, you know, even before pandemic, we work really well across different time zones,

22
0:01:35.000 --> 0:01:37.000
different cultures, asynchronously.

23
0:01:37.000 --> 0:01:40.000
But we invest a lot of time and money in events.

24
0:01:40.000 --> 0:01:44.000
And I just want to briefly talk about why.

25
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:50.000
And then what we learned, especially in the early days of the pandemic, like the experience was in, you know,

26
0:01:50.000 --> 0:01:59.000
I think universally not great with virtual events, but I wanted to sort of discuss what we learned over the past couple of years.

27
0:01:59.000 --> 0:02:05.000
And I also want to talk about events that actually work relatively well in a virtual format.

28
0:02:05.000 --> 0:02:09.000
And I think that's why virtual events aren't necessarily going away.

29
0:02:09.000 --> 0:02:12.000
It'll be in a different, you know, improved format.

30
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:21.000
But I want to talk about some topics or formats where, you know, virtual events actually setting actually works pretty well.

31
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:28.000
And how can you even complement or enhance the in-person events like this one?

32
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:32.000
So I think all of these photos are from pre-pandemic.

33
0:02:32.000 --> 0:02:40.000
I just looked at like a different events, like, you know, one on your top left, I guess, on your top left.

34
0:02:40.000 --> 0:02:45.000
That's from CubeCon. It's like a huge event that gets more than 10,000 people typically. Right.

35
0:02:45.000 --> 0:02:54.000
I don't know what the number was in Detroit last year, but, you know, it's like a huge event, you know, almost a week long.

36
0:02:54.000 --> 0:03:04.000
And the other picture, it's sort of the other end of the spectrum. I mean, in that picture somewhere, I can't remember where I am because it's been like four years.

37
0:03:04.000 --> 0:03:08.000
But that's KDE Academy. They get together like once a year for almost a week.

38
0:03:08.000 --> 0:03:12.000
And I mean, this was like a sort of good way for me to get introduced to the community.

39
0:03:12.000 --> 0:03:17.000
I didn't know anything about KDE or what even, you know, what the difference was between KDE and GNOME.

40
0:03:17.000 --> 0:03:24.000
But they really made me feel welcome. And it was a good way for me to get sort of onboarded and introduce to people in the community.

41
0:03:24.000 --> 0:03:37.000
So I definitely enjoy that. And even at large conferences like CubeCon or like OpenStack, you know, I mean, I get I need to remember to call them Open Infrastructure Foundation.

42
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:44.000
But one of the things I like about a lot of these conferences is that they have like a developer hacking room.

43
0:03:44.000 --> 0:03:55.000
So like a hacking lounge. So even if you've been contributing or working on something for a long time, you get a chance to sort of work together with somebody like in person in a more intimate setting.

44
0:03:55.000 --> 0:04:04.000
And I mean, I find myself sort of hiding in like a developer lounges with a lot of other developers.

45
0:04:04.000 --> 0:04:08.000
So like, you know, all these sessions are great.

46
0:04:08.000 --> 0:04:19.000
You know, ability to sort of interact with other people in person and collaborating are obviously a great benefit of these large events.

47
0:04:19.000 --> 0:04:30.000
But I think what like a lot of people, what I appreciate the most is, I mean, Bruce just talked about it, the ability to sort of form personal relationship with somebody in person.

48
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:38.000
This is really difficult to do virtually. Like, you know, you can work with somebody collaboratively for years.

49
0:04:38.000 --> 0:04:45.000
But, you know, you're not going to go much beyond like having a great professional relationship with somebody.

50
0:04:45.000 --> 0:04:52.000
I made a lot of good friends in Open Source over the past several years. And I guarantee you some of that happened in very informal settings.

51
0:04:52.000 --> 0:05:04.000
Like there's something intimate about sharing a beer or sharing a meal with somebody and that you can't get over Zoom or whatever platform you use to collaborate with somebody.

52
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:13.000
And especially if you had like, you know, maybe you had some conflict with somebody over meetings, like the direction of the project, how you're implementing something.

53
0:05:13.000 --> 0:05:21.000
Those tend to all go away if you share a meal with somebody. I mean, I had so many instances of that happening.

54
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:28.000
So, you know, being able to meet with somebody and in a more relaxed setting is something I really look forward to.

55
0:05:28.000 --> 0:05:37.000
And I took a picture, I found this picture of a hallway because I think the great benefit of these conferences is a hallway track.

56
0:05:37.000 --> 0:05:46.000
And then I don't know if you did the same thing. When I was putting together my schedule for FOSM, like I was trying to look at which sessions that I'm going to,

57
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:51.000
I also reached out to the friends that I knew who were going to be here and tried to decide when am I going to meet you for lunch?

58
0:05:51.000 --> 0:05:57.000
When am I going to go get together for, you know, for a beer at our favorite bar near Grand Place?

59
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:07.000
So that hallway track is, you know, obviously it's probably the one of the most important tracks that I look forward to in every conference.

60
0:06:07.000 --> 0:06:16.000
Unfortunately, this all came crashing to a halt like three years ago.

61
0:06:16.000 --> 0:06:23.000
I mean, I don't know if you were here at FOSM in 2020. I mean, shortly after that sort of world stopped, right?

62
0:06:23.000 --> 0:06:31.000
And then, you know, a lot of people made herculean efforts to move events online.

63
0:06:31.000 --> 0:06:39.000
I remember, like I presented at an event like in April. I mean, this is something that was sort of a local large meetup kind of thing in the Bay Area.

64
0:06:39.000 --> 0:06:47.000
They were scheduling for a while for devl people. And I mean, they did a wonderful job like moving everything onto like Hoppin.

65
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:50.000
Like, I mean, I think before then, I didn't even know what Hoppin was.

66
0:06:50.000 --> 0:06:58.000
They had some technical difficulties, even though I went through some speaker training on a platform.

67
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:08.000
But despite all that, they did a wonderful job of sort of moving things quickly online in about, I mean, they only had about a month to do it.

68
0:07:08.000 --> 0:07:15.000
Having said all that, what were our experiences with virtual events in the early days?

69
0:07:15.000 --> 0:07:23.000
And I mean, I found these pictures, and this is probably how a lot of us felt when events moved online.

70
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:30.000
And it's not just because we missed the hallway track or, you know, networking session over beer.

71
0:07:30.000 --> 0:07:37.000
A lot of people, I think, talked about Zoom fatigue. They were just tired of, you know, having more interactions with Zoom.

72
0:07:37.000 --> 0:07:43.000
I don't think I struggled with that as much because I was used to having a lot of Zoom meeting anyways.

73
0:07:43.000 --> 0:07:49.000
What I struggled with, what I found out was that I'll attend a session. There'll be like a 45-minute session,

74
0:07:49.000 --> 0:07:53.000
and then they give you a 10-15 minute break because that's how the events were used to run,

75
0:07:53.000 --> 0:07:58.000
because you need to move to a different room to get to the next session.

76
0:07:58.000 --> 0:08:02.000
During those 10-15 minutes, like, I didn't have anything else to do.

77
0:08:02.000 --> 0:08:06.000
So what I do is I'll check, like, Slack or email from work, right?

78
0:08:06.000 --> 0:08:10.000
I mean, when I'm at a conference like this, I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing.

79
0:08:10.000 --> 0:08:15.000
I tell myself, I'm not going to check Slack until, like, lunchtime or morning break or whatever it is.

80
0:08:15.000 --> 0:08:24.000
But when I was sitting at home, same place where I work at all day, I can get easily distracted and I'll check a Slack message.

81
0:08:24.000 --> 0:08:32.000
It wasn't urgent, but I'll respond to it, and then I realize, like, 20 minutes later, oh, shoot, this other session I was going to go to,

82
0:08:32.000 --> 0:08:36.000
I'm 10 minutes late to it. So I might as well just watch the recording then, right?

83
0:08:36.000 --> 0:08:39.000
So I was, I think I was getting, like, really confused.

84
0:08:39.000 --> 0:08:41.000
Like, am I at work or am I at a conference?

85
0:08:41.000 --> 0:08:45.000
Because I couldn't tell because I'm just my same home office.

86
0:08:45.000 --> 0:08:52.000
That's what I struggled with, and I think that's why the experience was really bad because they were trying to force-fit in-person event

87
0:08:52.000 --> 0:08:57.000
and they were trying to keep the same format but move it onto whatever platform that people were using.

88
0:08:57.000 --> 0:09:00.000
And that obviously didn't work very well.

89
0:09:00.000 --> 0:09:06.000
Because, you know, I think what we realize now is that you don't need a 15-minute break, right?

90
0:09:06.000 --> 0:09:08.000
You can just move to a next session.

91
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:18.000
I mean, you don't want to do that for eight hours, but you don't want people to be, like, switching to a different mode all of a sudden,

92
0:09:18.000 --> 0:09:20.000
like, because you have a 15-minute break.

93
0:09:20.000 --> 0:09:27.000
So I think that's one of the things that I really struggle with in the early days.

94
0:09:27.000 --> 0:09:34.000
But if you think about, like, because I think when we thought of events before the pandemic,

95
0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:40.000
we always thought about these, like, almost week-long conferences like KubeCon, or even, like, KD Academy that's almost a week long.

96
0:09:40.000 --> 0:09:46.000
You're away at a different location for about almost a week.

97
0:09:46.000 --> 0:09:54.000
But if you think about it, before the pandemic, a lot of us in open source were doing a lot of collaboration work, like, on a virtual platform

98
0:09:54.000 --> 0:09:56.000
and not necessarily in person.

99
0:09:56.000 --> 0:09:58.000
Like, Hackathon is a good example.

100
0:09:58.000 --> 0:10:03.000
I mean, this is something, you know, I helped start, like, when I was at GitLab.

101
0:10:03.000 --> 0:10:08.000
We once a quarter, community members will get together for two days, and then we'll just, you know,

102
0:10:08.000 --> 0:10:15.000
you don't have to commit to be, you know, at the Hackathon for 48 hours, but whatever time you can commit to in those two days,

103
0:10:15.000 --> 0:10:19.000
like, we're willing to encourage, like, contributions from the community.

104
0:10:19.000 --> 0:10:23.000
So obviously, the metrics we looked at was how many contributions we're getting.

105
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:27.000
Those are, like, this is something that we can count and measure.

106
0:10:27.000 --> 0:10:32.000
But what was more gratifying, I mean, at the end of my, like, two-plus years at GitLab,

107
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:38.000
what I noticed during Hackathon is that there's just a lot more chatter on our online, like, chat platform,

108
0:10:38.000 --> 0:10:41.000
like, we're using GitLab at the time, and more people are helping each other,

109
0:10:41.000 --> 0:10:45.000
and then community members are forming connections and bonds, right?

110
0:10:45.000 --> 0:10:51.000
So that was very gratifying in addition to the lot of contributions that we're getting.

111
0:10:51.000 --> 0:10:53.000
So that's one example.

112
0:10:53.000 --> 0:11:01.000
The other example on the top right, this is my presentation from two years ago with my friend Sophia.

113
0:11:01.000 --> 0:11:07.000
So this is about documentation, like, how, you know, how to, like, really accelerate, you know,

114
0:11:07.000 --> 0:11:10.000
documentation on open source projects.

115
0:11:10.000 --> 0:11:17.000
And the example I gave was that, so, what I was, let me step back.

116
0:11:17.000 --> 0:11:23.000
I was working at Linux Foundation at the time, and Sophia is at Ericsson.

117
0:11:23.000 --> 0:11:28.000
So a lot of the networking projects in DLF, they had set release cycles,

118
0:11:28.000 --> 0:11:31.000
like, either three months or six months release cycle,

119
0:11:31.000 --> 0:11:34.000
and if your subproject wants to be part of the release,

120
0:11:34.000 --> 0:11:38.000
there are a couple of documentation-related milestones that you need to hit.

121
0:11:38.000 --> 0:11:42.000
Like, if you don't have stuff documented, sorry, you're not going to be part of the release.

122
0:11:42.000 --> 0:11:49.000
That's sort of one way of us forcing documentation milestones to be met.

123
0:11:49.000 --> 0:11:53.000
And first, documentation milestone is relatively simple.

124
0:11:53.000 --> 0:11:58.000
You just basically, in your repo, create a subdirectory for the release.

125
0:11:58.000 --> 0:12:04.000
For Project ABC, you need to have documentation structure sort of laid out with some header information and labeling.

126
0:12:04.000 --> 0:12:11.000
So it's sort of a routine task, but it's not something that gets you up in the morning necessarily, but it just has to be done.

127
0:12:11.000 --> 0:12:16.000
So what I suggested to Sophia was that let's make a, like, a, you know, fun event out of this.

128
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:22.000
Like, we're doing a sort of like a household chore, but let's sort of, you know, almost like gamifying it.

129
0:12:22.000 --> 0:12:26.000
Let's all get together virtually for a couple of hours,

130
0:12:26.000 --> 0:12:31.000
and people have people complete their documentation milestone for that release.

131
0:12:31.000 --> 0:12:41.000
And then first, like, a documentation milestone for that particular release for OPNFV project happened to be like a week before FOSM.

132
0:12:41.000 --> 0:12:45.000
So I contacted Sophia. I said, I'm coming to Europe anyways.

133
0:12:45.000 --> 0:12:48.000
Why don't I come to Erikson in Sweden?

134
0:12:48.000 --> 0:12:57.000
Because she's a documentation lead for OPNFV, but there are a couple of other Erikson people that were leading other subprojects in OPNFV.

135
0:12:57.000 --> 0:13:03.000
So we'll get together in a conference room. We'll set up a bridge so people can join if they want to.

136
0:13:03.000 --> 0:13:12.000
And to my surprise, like, when we started at like 10 in the morning in Stockholm, people dialed in from Nokia, like an hour ahead in Finland.

137
0:13:12.000 --> 0:13:23.000
That I sort of expected because the technical steering committee chairs at Nokia, because I was pretty sure that he'd be able to sort of twist some people's arms at Nokia.

138
0:13:23.000 --> 0:13:30.000
But what we found out on the audio bridge was on GoToMeeting at the time was people from Japan joined.

139
0:13:30.000 --> 0:13:38.000
Like, they all got together at like an NEC office in Tokyo, and they were just going to spend 30 to 45 minutes doing the documentation work, and they were just going to go for beers.

140
0:13:38.000 --> 0:13:42.000
Which was perfect, right? And so got a chance for people to get together.

141
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:45.000
And the same thing happened with some people from China.

142
0:13:45.000 --> 0:13:52.000
So, I mean, we worked for like an hour and a half, two hours in Stockholm, went for lunch, and had another session.

143
0:13:52.000 --> 0:14:01.000
So people from rest of Europe that were late starters, and then North American could sort of join in.

144
0:14:01.000 --> 0:14:04.000
And then we saw the same thing happen, so that was pretty fun.

145
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:10.000
And then that sort of became sort of a tradition for a lot of the documentation milestones.

146
0:14:10.000 --> 0:14:12.000
They just made it fun.

147
0:14:12.000 --> 0:14:20.000
You don't have to be in the same city at the same time, but it gave people a chance to bond and work together.

148
0:14:20.000 --> 0:14:28.000
The other example that I wanted to add, you see a lot of open source communities or commercial open source companies do this.

149
0:14:28.000 --> 0:14:34.000
They do these workshops, and we did the same thing at Cube.

150
0:14:34.000 --> 0:14:40.000
This is a way for us to sort of provide educational content to people, because they'll ask questions about,

151
0:14:40.000 --> 0:14:44.000
we want to understand your caching feature better. How do we do data modeling?

152
0:14:44.000 --> 0:14:48.000
And one of our stars, a webinar, is sitting there, odd none.

153
0:14:48.000 --> 0:15:00.000
So this gave us a, not just way for us to reach people synchronously through webinar, this helped us build a content on our YouTube channel.

154
0:15:00.000 --> 0:15:06.000
And this really helped. I think, I can't remember what speaker it was.

155
0:15:06.000 --> 0:15:09.000
I can't remember it was Bruce, or maybe it was other speaker.

156
0:15:09.000 --> 0:15:15.000
Content is really king, right? So you want to provide resources for community members that can use.

157
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:19.000
And yeah, we've been doing this even before the pandemic.

158
0:15:19.000 --> 0:15:26.000
And this is something that's always been an arsenal and something that we need to take advantage of.

159
0:15:26.000 --> 0:15:32.000
And there are definitely a lot of benefits of virtual events, and here are a few of them.

160
0:15:32.000 --> 0:15:39.000
One is something like a webinar, it takes almost no effort to spin this up.

161
0:15:39.000 --> 0:15:45.000
Like if you have a Zoom account, I guess you'll have to upgrade to Zoom webinar.

162
0:15:45.000 --> 0:15:52.000
But if you're not going to have more than 100% on your training sessions,

163
0:15:52.000 --> 0:15:57.000
you can just get away with your regular Zoom account for up to 100 people.

164
0:15:57.000 --> 0:16:03.000
So it's pretty easy to set up and start, because it doesn't cost very much.

165
0:16:03.000 --> 0:16:08.000
It allows you to do a lot of experimentation. Like a documentation is a good example.

166
0:16:08.000 --> 0:16:15.000
The only cost was really setting up another audio bridge on GoToMeeting at that point.

167
0:16:15.000 --> 0:16:23.000
But if you compare that to what people consider a pretty lightweight in-person event, like a meetup.

168
0:16:23.000 --> 0:16:32.000
Let's say you want to schedule a meetup at one of your local community members' company for a couple of hours.

169
0:16:32.000 --> 0:16:42.000
You have to figure out a room, maybe you have to order food and drinks to encourage people to come and actually feed them while they're there.

170
0:16:42.000 --> 0:16:50.000
But also you may have to deal with security at your company so that people can come have access to your conference facilities.

171
0:16:50.000 --> 0:16:56.000
So that's not a trivial amount of work. And it's supposedly not a full industry event.

172
0:16:56.000 --> 0:17:05.000
It's a casual in-person meetup, but even that takes several hours to plan and organize.

173
0:17:05.000 --> 0:17:08.000
And not just for organizers, even for community members.

174
0:17:08.000 --> 0:17:14.000
If you force everything to be in person, you're going to end up incurring some costs.

175
0:17:14.000 --> 0:17:19.000
I remember going to a local meetup in the Bay Area where I live.

176
0:17:19.000 --> 0:17:26.000
I should have been without traffic. I should have been able to get there in 15, 20 minutes.

177
0:17:26.000 --> 0:17:30.000
This was at noon on Thursday. You wouldn't necessarily expect traffic.

178
0:17:30.000 --> 0:17:33.000
But for whatever reason, it took me 40 minutes to get there.

179
0:17:33.000 --> 0:17:38.000
I was just rolling my eyes as I was driving. This is not good use of my time.

180
0:17:38.000 --> 0:17:41.000
I'm actually commuting to go to a 2R event.

181
0:17:41.000 --> 0:17:53.000
So compared to a lot of in-person stuff that we've traditionally been doing, you can do this at very low cost.

182
0:17:53.000 --> 0:18:00.000
The other thing I like about the virtual events, and this is an observation. I don't know if this is scientifically true.

183
0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:06.000
A lot of the virtual events, event materials seem to be available a lot quicker.

184
0:18:06.000 --> 0:18:13.000
Because what happens is that if you're doing a YouTube live stream, unless you have to do an edit, it's available right away.

185
0:18:13.000 --> 0:18:17.000
Even if you weren't able to join the session synchronously.

186
0:18:17.000 --> 0:18:27.000
Unless you insist on doing a professional editing of the live stream, it's available right away to people in the community.

187
0:18:27.000 --> 0:18:39.000
Or even people outside of the community. I think with Adna and other colleagues, we've done 15 to 20 workshops over the past year and a half.

188
0:18:39.000 --> 0:18:43.000
I only had to edit one of our live stream video once.

189
0:18:43.000 --> 0:18:49.000
That's because we had some technical difficulties like I did today early on with one of the panelists.

190
0:18:49.000 --> 0:18:56.000
All I did was cut out the first three minutes of the video because we were just struggling with buttons.

191
0:18:56.000 --> 0:19:05.000
I think that's another reason why I'm a big proponent of trying to see if you can move stuff online versus doing it in person.

192
0:19:05.000 --> 0:19:13.000
I talked about documentation already. There are other things that work pretty well in open source communities in a virtual setting.

193
0:19:13.000 --> 0:19:18.000
One is GitLab used to do this. I think they stopped this for a while.

194
0:19:18.000 --> 0:19:22.000
Over the weekend, they do issue triaging.

195
0:19:22.000 --> 0:19:28.000
If you have an open source project of decent size, you're going to have thousands and thousands of issues.

196
0:19:28.000 --> 0:19:38.000
Labeling them, putting priority on them is a mundane task that's not necessarily fun.

197
0:19:38.000 --> 0:19:42.000
But if you want to give people an opportunity, I think GitLab used to do this over the weekend.

198
0:19:42.000 --> 0:19:44.000
You don't have to spend the whole weekend.

199
0:19:44.000 --> 0:19:53.000
But any amount of time that you can contribute to helping triage issues, the big one is finding duplicate issues and merging them,

200
0:19:53.000 --> 0:19:56.000
which is a great house cleaning type of thing to do.

201
0:19:56.000 --> 0:20:03.000
That's another type of activity that you don't necessarily do this in person.

202
0:20:03.000 --> 0:20:05.000
That's another example.

203
0:20:05.000 --> 0:20:07.000
The other one is testing.

204
0:20:07.000 --> 0:20:14.000
They're talking about a unit testing or functional testing.

205
0:20:14.000 --> 0:20:18.000
If you have a UI team or a UX team that want to get community feedback, this doesn't have to be done in person.

206
0:20:18.000 --> 0:20:25.000
This is pretty simple to do, set up online.

207
0:20:25.000 --> 0:20:29.000
Pause for the other picture. That's supposed to be a tape cutting thing.

208
0:20:29.000 --> 0:20:35.000
If you're doing your inaugural event, rather than insisting on trying to do this in person,

209
0:20:35.000 --> 0:20:42.000
try to experiment with the content and the format, like online, because it's going to cost you a lot less.

210
0:20:42.000 --> 0:20:48.000
At KEEU, we're thinking about doing our first conference sometime in September,

211
0:20:48.000 --> 0:20:51.000
and we already decided this is going to be done virtually.

212
0:20:51.000 --> 0:20:57.000
If we were to secure a venue all day in San Francisco, that alone is going to be pretty expensive,

213
0:20:57.000 --> 0:21:00.000
and logistical challenge is going to be a lot worse.

214
0:21:00.000 --> 0:21:05.000
We're going to start online and make sure that validate the format and the content

215
0:21:05.000 --> 0:21:08.000
and the type of the audience that we're going after.

216
0:21:08.000 --> 0:21:15.000
Then, at some point, if we're large enough to do it in person, we will have built the audience,

217
0:21:15.000 --> 0:21:24.000
and then we already tested it out in a more cost-effective manner.

218
0:21:24.000 --> 0:21:31.000
I talked briefly about complementing in-person events.

219
0:21:31.000 --> 0:21:35.000
As we're putting together this conference later this year,

220
0:21:35.000 --> 0:21:43.000
I talked to several event management vendors that have experience in both in-person, hybrid, and online events.

221
0:21:43.000 --> 0:21:49.000
Every single one of them, I started talking to them in October, November last year.

222
0:21:49.000 --> 0:21:54.000
One of the questions I asked is that a lot of the events are going back in person.

223
0:21:54.000 --> 0:22:01.000
Are people like a bandling, like virtual or hybrid events, the answer from every single one of them was no.

224
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:04.000
There seems to be still a market for virtual events.

225
0:22:04.000 --> 0:22:11.000
Then, one good example, a few of them provided was that this isn't just like broadcasting

226
0:22:11.000 --> 0:22:16.000
or live streaming an in-person session that's happening like it is now.

227
0:22:16.000 --> 0:22:24.000
What's happening is that a lot of companies or communities are moving things virtual almost as a separate track.

228
0:22:24.000 --> 0:22:28.000
A good example was a lot of conferences have day zero events.

229
0:22:28.000 --> 0:22:35.000
If you have an event that's officially starting on Tuesday, they might have something else going on on Monday.

230
0:22:35.000 --> 0:22:40.000
It could be a local meetup, it could be a project team meeting,

231
0:22:40.000 --> 0:22:46.000
or some open source communities do this. OpenStack used to do this. They'll have an orientation for new members.

232
0:22:46.000 --> 0:22:52.000
If you want to get a good introductory overview of all the projects in OpenStack

233
0:22:52.000 --> 0:22:56.000
and learning how to contribute, like submitting your first patch, for example,

234
0:22:56.000 --> 0:23:03.000
they actually did this over the weekend before their conference starts on Monday.

235
0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:07.000
A lot of the day zero events, I think they're moving them virtual

236
0:23:07.000 --> 0:23:11.000
so that even if you can't travel on site to that conference, you can still participate.

237
0:23:11.000 --> 0:23:16.000
You're broadening the audience and allowing more people to participate,

238
0:23:16.000 --> 0:23:20.000
at least some portion of the event, even if you can't travel.

239
0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:25.000
My suggestion, if you're going to do, I'm all for the day zero events.

240
0:23:25.000 --> 0:23:28.000
I would even make this happen the week before.

241
0:23:28.000 --> 0:23:31.000
Let's say that if your day zero traditionally was on Monday,

242
0:23:31.000 --> 0:23:35.000
I would do this virtually on Thursday or Wednesday the week before.

243
0:23:35.000 --> 0:23:41.000
The reason why I say that is that rather than people having to arrive on Sunday

244
0:23:41.000 --> 0:23:45.000
to go to those days or even on Monday, they can just stay home.

245
0:23:45.000 --> 0:23:49.000
They can just watch this virtually and they can just spend Monday traveling

246
0:23:49.000 --> 0:23:53.000
so they spend less time away from home.

247
0:23:53.000 --> 0:23:58.000
I'm sure a lot of you have children and kids like I do.

248
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:04.000
If you have to be gone for a whole week, that just creates a lot of logistical challenges.

249
0:24:04.000 --> 0:24:07.000
Who's going to take her to soccer practice, etc., etc.

250
0:24:07.000 --> 0:24:11.000
The less time you're away from home, I think it's a bonus.

251
0:24:11.000 --> 0:24:15.000
I think you're doing your community members a big favor too.

252
0:24:15.000 --> 0:24:18.000
The other thing that I like about this virtual format,

253
0:24:18.000 --> 0:24:23.000
and I see this happening with FOSM too with some of the developer dev rooms,

254
0:24:23.000 --> 0:24:27.000
is you're basically increasing the capacity of a lot of the talk sessions

255
0:24:27.000 --> 0:24:33.000
because you're creating a parallel track that's what's happening in person.

256
0:24:33.000 --> 0:24:38.000
I'd be on both sides of the CFP process.

257
0:24:38.000 --> 0:24:43.000
Unfortunately, you're going to have to make some hard decisions about not accepting a talk,

258
0:24:43.000 --> 0:24:45.000
which is always a hard thing to do.

259
0:24:45.000 --> 0:24:49.000
By increasing the capacity, you have to deal with less of that.

260
0:24:49.000 --> 0:24:56.000
Especially for first-time speakers, a lot of the conference has gotten pretty competitive

261
0:24:56.000 --> 0:25:00.000
in terms of how difficult it is to get your talk accepted.

262
0:25:00.000 --> 0:25:10.000
This helps potentially increase your capacity for more speakers and more discussion topics.

263
0:25:10.000 --> 0:25:13.000
A couple of quick dos and don'ts.

264
0:25:13.000 --> 0:25:17.000
I sort of mentioned the first one in terms of the don'ts.

265
0:25:17.000 --> 0:25:20.000
When you're moving things to a virtual format,

266
0:25:20.000 --> 0:25:25.000
don't do the same thing that you would have done in person.

267
0:25:25.000 --> 0:25:31.000
You don't need a 10-15 minute break between every session.

268
0:25:31.000 --> 0:25:34.000
You want to have some break during your conference,

269
0:25:34.000 --> 0:25:37.000
but you don't want people to be distracted

270
0:25:37.000 --> 0:25:40.000
because they're just watching it from their home office

271
0:25:40.000 --> 0:25:43.000
or even if they're in the office, they're watching it from their desk.

272
0:25:43.000 --> 0:25:48.000
They don't need the 10 minutes to walk through a different room to talk to a session.

273
0:25:48.000 --> 0:25:59.000
When you have people's attention, make the most of that opportunity.

274
0:25:59.000 --> 0:26:03.000
I've also seen some communities do this.

275
0:26:03.000 --> 0:26:06.000
Let's say you have five, six hours of content.

276
0:26:06.000 --> 0:26:09.000
You don't need to do it in one single day.

277
0:26:09.000 --> 0:26:12.000
You can even split it up over two days.

278
0:26:12.000 --> 0:26:15.000
I've seen some companies do this over three days.

279
0:26:15.000 --> 0:26:20.000
You only have an hour to two-hour chunk that you need to schedule for

280
0:26:20.000 --> 0:26:22.000
over the two-three-day period.

281
0:26:22.000 --> 0:26:27.000
That might make it easier to fit stuff into your schedule.

282
0:26:27.000 --> 0:26:29.000
Although that's not...

283
0:26:29.000 --> 0:26:31.000
I'd be a little worried about that because

284
0:26:31.000 --> 0:26:34.000
how do you make sure that people don't drop off after day one?

285
0:26:34.000 --> 0:26:36.000
You have to manage that,

286
0:26:36.000 --> 0:26:40.000
but that's another thing I've seen some communities and companies do.

287
0:26:40.000 --> 0:26:44.000
The second one, this is the one that really drives me crazy

288
0:26:44.000 --> 0:26:46.000
and I mentioned this too.

289
0:26:46.000 --> 0:26:49.000
If you have stuff live-streaming,

290
0:26:49.000 --> 0:26:52.000
make it available on your YouTube channel right away.

291
0:26:52.000 --> 0:26:56.000
Don't have people registered to get content.

292
0:26:56.000 --> 0:27:00.000
You're basically asking for people's email address so they can watch the video.

293
0:27:00.000 --> 0:27:02.000
I hated one that happens.

294
0:27:02.000 --> 0:27:07.000
I went to a conference a couple of months ago because our CPL was presenting.

295
0:27:07.000 --> 0:27:10.000
They told us the video should be available within a week.

296
0:27:10.000 --> 0:27:11.000
I said, great.

297
0:27:11.000 --> 0:27:13.000
Then I went back to the event website.

298
0:27:13.000 --> 0:27:15.000
They said, oh, if you want to watch the recording,

299
0:27:15.000 --> 0:27:18.000
please register by providing your email address.

300
0:27:18.000 --> 0:27:20.000
I think I was diplomatic.

301
0:27:20.000 --> 0:27:22.000
I sent them an email and I said,

302
0:27:22.000 --> 0:27:24.000
this doesn't seem very open source to me,

303
0:27:24.000 --> 0:27:27.000
like if you're asking for an email.

304
0:27:27.000 --> 0:27:30.000
Actually, they came back to their credit and said,

305
0:27:30.000 --> 0:27:33.000
actually, if you go to the YouTube channel, you'll find it here.

306
0:27:33.000 --> 0:27:36.000
It's like, why don't you then tell people that on the website?

307
0:27:36.000 --> 0:27:38.000
It's like, why are you kind of hiding that fact?

308
0:27:38.000 --> 0:27:41.000
It just drove me nuts.

309
0:27:41.000 --> 0:27:47.000
Please don't do that.

310
0:27:47.000 --> 0:27:49.000
Put a wall around your content.

311
0:27:49.000 --> 0:27:53.000
Please provide your email address to download this white paper.

312
0:27:53.000 --> 0:27:57.000
That doesn't sound like a white paper then.

313
0:27:57.000 --> 0:28:01.000
Anyhow, I guess that's my soapbox.

314
0:28:01.000 --> 0:28:04.000
If you're doing the event virtually,

315
0:28:04.000 --> 0:28:07.000
don't force people to participate synchronously

316
0:28:07.000 --> 0:28:09.000
because you have time zone issues.

317
0:28:09.000 --> 0:28:13.000
This is why I like the model we had at GitLab.

318
0:28:13.000 --> 0:28:14.000
You have a two-day window.

319
0:28:14.000 --> 0:28:16.000
You can participate any time you want.

320
0:28:16.000 --> 0:28:20.000
We're not asking you to spend 48 hours unless you want to.

321
0:28:20.000 --> 0:28:23.000
Even if you can spend just 30 minutes over a two-day period,

322
0:28:23.000 --> 0:28:25.000
that's great.

323
0:28:25.000 --> 0:28:30.000
I'm not going to judge you because you have better things to do.

324
0:28:30.000 --> 0:28:35.000
On the other side of the slide here,

325
0:28:35.000 --> 0:28:38.000
and I was really good at this.

326
0:28:38.000 --> 0:28:41.000
I'm not just saying this because you bought me beer last night.

327
0:28:41.000 --> 0:28:43.000
When we did our workshop,

328
0:28:43.000 --> 0:28:48.000
I was really good at putting materials available like a week in advance.

329
0:28:48.000 --> 0:28:50.000
People can check out the slides.

330
0:28:50.000 --> 0:28:51.000
They can prep the content.

331
0:28:51.000 --> 0:28:56.000
We also have hands-on workshop on our Cloud instance called Q-Cloud.

332
0:28:56.000 --> 0:29:00.000
People can actually tie it up to their data sources

333
0:29:00.000 --> 0:29:02.000
and start experimenting with it.

334
0:29:02.000 --> 0:29:07.000
The sooner we put it up, our scores were actually better.

335
0:29:07.000 --> 0:29:12.000
Even if the slides change over the next several days,

336
0:29:12.000 --> 0:29:16.000
having the content available ahead of time so that people can prep,

337
0:29:16.000 --> 0:29:20.000
it just provides a lot better experience.

338
0:29:20.000 --> 0:29:24.000
It also allows people to ask questions ahead of time.

339
0:29:24.000 --> 0:29:29.000
You're almost having asynchronous Q&A session.

340
0:29:29.000 --> 0:29:33.000
That just makes life easier for a lot of people, including presenters,

341
0:29:33.000 --> 0:29:36.000
because you know what to expect.

342
0:29:36.000 --> 0:29:40.000
The last one is similar.

343
0:29:40.000 --> 0:29:46.000
I saw this, like Linux Foundation did this a few years ago.

344
0:29:46.000 --> 0:29:51.000
I made a presentation, again with Sophia on documentation,

345
0:29:51.000 --> 0:29:55.000
and then there's a Slack channel for Q&As.

346
0:29:55.000 --> 0:29:58.000
After our presentation, we were on there for like 30, 45 minutes,

347
0:29:58.000 --> 0:30:00.000
which I thought was great.

348
0:30:00.000 --> 0:30:02.000
Typically, when you're at a convention center,

349
0:30:02.000 --> 0:30:05.000
you get kind of get shoot out after your presentation,

350
0:30:05.000 --> 0:30:08.000
so people only have like a five minute window to ask you questions,

351
0:30:08.000 --> 0:30:10.000
like if you ran out of time.

352
0:30:10.000 --> 0:30:15.000
This just gave us a lot more time to answer questions.

353
0:30:15.000 --> 0:30:19.000
Also, for people to be vocal with their comments and feedback,

354
0:30:19.000 --> 0:30:21.000
which I thought was great,

355
0:30:21.000 --> 0:30:28.000
and I made sure that I let a lot of people know that I thought that was pretty awesome.

356
0:30:28.000 --> 0:30:33.000
I know I'm almost out of time, so I think I've covered most of these.

357
0:30:33.000 --> 0:30:35.000
It's not either or.

358
0:30:35.000 --> 0:30:41.000
The virtual events can complement what you're doing in person.

359
0:30:41.000 --> 0:30:45.000
Just remember that we've been doing a virtual collaboration for a long time,

360
0:30:45.000 --> 0:30:50.000
and this is definitely an important toolkit to help community members,

361
0:30:50.000 --> 0:30:54.000
especially for people who can't always travel for whatever reason,

362
0:30:54.000 --> 0:30:56.000
financial or otherwise.

363
0:30:56.000 --> 0:30:59.000
The final point I want to make,

364
0:30:59.000 --> 0:31:05.000
actually, the platforms that we're using for online events, including Hopin,

365
0:31:05.000 --> 0:31:08.000
I'm not saying that's my favorite tool,

366
0:31:08.000 --> 0:31:11.000
but even Hopin has really evolved over time.

367
0:31:11.000 --> 0:31:15.000
One of the things I noticed when I talked to event manager and vendors is that

368
0:31:15.000 --> 0:31:19.000
they'll give a list of here the virtual event platforms that we support.

369
0:31:19.000 --> 0:31:24.000
One company, they provided like 15 logos, including like Hopin,

370
0:31:24.000 --> 0:31:27.000
so there are just more alternatives available.

371
0:31:27.000 --> 0:31:32.000
So I think we have better platforms and tools to run events virtually.

372
0:31:32.000 --> 0:31:35.000
Yeah, I think that's it.

373
0:31:35.000 --> 0:31:38.000
I just want to make sure I have time for questions.

374
0:31:38.000 --> 0:31:42.000
Hopefully you're able to hear me out there. Thank you.

375
0:31:42.000 --> 0:31:46.000
Ray, because it's you, you can do one question, even though we're over time,

376
0:31:46.000 --> 0:31:47.000
because we think you're awesome.

377
0:31:47.000 --> 0:31:48.000
All right, thank you.

378
0:31:48.000 --> 0:31:50.000
Anyone want to ask a question?

379
0:31:50.000 --> 0:31:52.000
I see a hand.

380
0:31:52.000 --> 0:31:55.000
Off we go.

381
0:31:55.000 --> 0:31:58.000
You are the final question of the community, Deborah, for FOSDAM 2023.

382
0:31:58.000 --> 0:32:00.000
Congratulations.

383
0:32:00.000 --> 0:32:03.000
Well, thank you very much for the talk.

384
0:32:03.000 --> 0:32:04.000
Thank you.

385
0:32:04.000 --> 0:32:09.000
We have a global market, but obviously we don't have big resources like big companies.

386
0:32:09.000 --> 0:32:18.000
So I wonder how much it is to set up the whole logistic of the virtual event

387
0:32:18.000 --> 0:32:22.000
live streaming, because we definitely have a global market.

388
0:32:22.000 --> 0:32:25.000
So obviously you can't be relying on everyone,

389
0:32:25.000 --> 0:32:28.000
assistant to your event if you do it in person.

390
0:32:28.000 --> 0:32:34.000
But I'm thinking probably best thing is to just record it and then put it

391
0:32:34.000 --> 0:32:38.000
available online a week later or something like that,

392
0:32:38.000 --> 0:32:42.000
rather than having to live stream it as a proper hybrid event.

393
0:32:42.000 --> 0:32:44.000
What do you think?

394
0:32:44.000 --> 0:32:48.000
Well, I mean, so the question for people online, you know,

395
0:32:48.000 --> 0:32:50.000
because even Zooms aren't free, right?

396
0:32:50.000 --> 0:32:55.000
And then, you know, is it okay to sort of prerecord things and make content

397
0:32:55.000 --> 0:32:59.000
available for people to consume and ask questions to?

398
0:32:59.000 --> 0:33:01.000
I think that's completely valid.

399
0:33:01.000 --> 0:33:04.000
Actually, one of the things I learned from these vendors, they don't,

400
0:33:04.000 --> 0:33:08.000
on a virtual platform, they actually don't encourage you to have a live

401
0:33:08.000 --> 0:33:11.000
presentation in the Q&A, because there's just a lot more technical

402
0:33:11.000 --> 0:33:13.000
difficulty you can run through.

403
0:33:13.000 --> 0:33:16.000
So they call it single lives.

404
0:33:16.000 --> 0:33:21.000
They prefer that they have the presenter record and be available for

405
0:33:21.000 --> 0:33:24.000
10 minutes of questioning as an example.

406
0:33:24.000 --> 0:33:27.000
But, you know, if you don't want to have person available 10 minutes

407
0:33:27.000 --> 0:33:31.000
online for questioning, you can still have like a creative Google Doc,

408
0:33:31.000 --> 0:33:35.000
like here's a recording, please submit your questions over this period

409
0:33:35.000 --> 0:33:38.000
of time and the presenter or other people can answer them.

410
0:33:38.000 --> 0:33:40.000
So it's all documented, right?

411
0:33:40.000 --> 0:33:42.000
So I think that's completely valid.

412
0:33:42.000 --> 0:33:44.000
So you don't have to use Zoom.

413
0:33:44.000 --> 0:33:48.000
I mean, I just happened to be, I've been using Zoom for the past few years

414
0:33:48.000 --> 0:33:50.000
so that's what I'm comfortable with.

415
0:33:50.000 --> 0:33:53.000
But you can do live streaming from Google Hangout.

416
0:33:53.000 --> 0:33:57.000
But I haven't tried it hands-on myself, but I know that's doable.

417
0:33:57.000 --> 0:33:59.000
So that's an option.

418
0:33:59.000 --> 0:34:02.000
But having something prerecorded available on YouTube channel,

419
0:34:02.000 --> 0:34:04.000
but here's a documentation.

420
0:34:04.000 --> 0:34:06.000
It could be a Wiki page or Google Docs.

421
0:34:06.000 --> 0:34:08.000
Please submit your questions.

422
0:34:08.000 --> 0:34:11.000
We'll close the questioning in like seven days and, you know,

423
0:34:11.000 --> 0:34:14.000
whoever the presenter was or the content expert is,

424
0:34:14.000 --> 0:34:16.000
we'll get back to you with their answers.

425
0:34:16.000 --> 0:34:18.000
So I think that's a completely valid thing to do.

426
0:34:18.000 --> 0:34:22.000
It doesn't have to be like 100% interactive.

427
0:34:22.000 --> 0:34:25.000
So thank you.

428
0:34:25.000 --> 0:34:43.000
Applause.
