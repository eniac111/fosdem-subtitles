1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:14.440
Okay, good. Thank you. Well, I'm Gal Blondin. I work for the Eclipse Foundation.

2
0:00:14.440 --> 0:00:20.640
Hello. Can you hear me? Is it working fine? Yeah. Well, I'm the other one.

3
0:00:20.640 --> 0:00:29.320
Alberto, from Open Nebula. And the topic today, so actually that was a proposal from Alberto.

4
0:00:29.320 --> 0:00:37.120
About how about we talk together at first about European Open Source.

5
0:00:37.120 --> 0:00:43.000
So I think you proposed the topic and I proposed the title, which is,

6
0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:50.400
is European Open Source a thing? Because well, over the last, I don't know, two,

7
0:00:50.400 --> 0:00:59.280
three years, maybe more, I have been in lots of events where I see people who want to do

8
0:00:59.280 --> 0:01:04.240
more Open Source because the thing that Open Source is good for Europe. But at some point,

9
0:01:04.240 --> 0:01:10.080
there is always somebody who start with the idea that, well, Open Source is cool,

10
0:01:10.080 --> 0:01:16.240
but what about we would do Open Source and try to limit it to European companies,

11
0:01:16.240 --> 0:01:22.440
to European stakeholders or stuff like that. And so that's what we want to discuss today.

12
0:01:22.440 --> 0:01:30.640
So we prepared it like a list of questions. We expect that some of you maybe want to

13
0:01:30.640 --> 0:01:36.800
change your point of view. I think that we will have different point of views on some

14
0:01:36.800 --> 0:01:43.680
of the topics. And well, let's start. Do you want to define European Open Source?

15
0:01:43.680 --> 0:01:51.840
Okay. Well, I would like to explain a bit how selfish I am because this whole session for me

16
0:01:51.840 --> 0:02:07.480
personally is... Second. Louder, like that. No, but you need to use the microphone because we are

17
0:02:07.480 --> 0:02:25.760
recording. Okay. Yes. Okay. So I just wanted to explain for me personally what this session

18
0:02:25.760 --> 0:02:32.160
means. As Gayle has mentioned, the concept of European Open Source has been around for a while.

19
0:02:32.160 --> 0:02:42.120
It's been in the last three, four years that it's been discussed within this new geopolitical

20
0:02:42.120 --> 0:02:48.960
environment in which we all live now, and also especially at European level. So for me,

21
0:02:48.960 --> 0:02:54.000
I'm one of the people that's actually pushing for this concept to be something different from other

22
0:02:54.000 --> 0:03:01.040
stuff. But I also, I can confess, I have my doubts about how we define European Open Source and where

23
0:03:01.040 --> 0:03:08.360
that is something that might be divisive or counterproductive. Even have my position, let's

24
0:03:08.360 --> 0:03:13.480
say, and that's also part of my job. And I'm happy to say both on my personal level and professional

25
0:03:13.480 --> 0:03:19.160
level, I agree on the things I kind of defend. But I also have as a European some doubts about

26
0:03:19.160 --> 0:03:23.480
this and what these might imply for the Open Source sector. So for me, this session is also

27
0:03:23.480 --> 0:03:28.400
about learning what all of you think about this. And just because we thought that it was about time

28
0:03:28.400 --> 0:03:34.160
to have an open discussion, an open debate within the European Open Source community, the implications

29
0:03:34.160 --> 0:03:42.240
that this concept might have. Yes, maybe just a few words about me. So I work for the Egyptian

30
0:03:42.240 --> 0:03:51.000
Foundation, which moved to its legal incorporation to Brussels two years ago. And that's very

31
0:03:51.000 --> 0:03:58.920
important for us that we are a global organization established in Brussels. Because when it comes

32
0:03:58.920 --> 0:04:05.400
to the answer to what is European Open Source, I think that from my perspective, at least Open

33
0:04:05.400 --> 0:04:12.280
Source and free software, that's everything we do where you can use, study, modify and redistribute

34
0:04:12.280 --> 0:04:17.920
the software. And there is nothing to do with Europe. So that must be done in Europe, outside

35
0:04:17.920 --> 0:04:22.880
Europe. Everything that is written in Europe should be usable everywhere else. We should be

36
0:04:22.880 --> 0:04:33.120
able to use. So that's really sticking to the definitions of the FSF and the open source

37
0:04:33.120 --> 0:04:44.520
definition. So still, I think that we can have a specific approach to Open Source in Europe. That's

38
0:04:44.520 --> 0:04:52.160
how we help European organizations, how we help European companies do more and understand better

39
0:04:52.160 --> 0:05:01.320
in Open Source. And that's also why I wanted to start with this topic, because every time I go in

40
0:05:01.320 --> 0:05:09.120
a conference, I have been in conferences where people were telling, yeah, well, we get money,

41
0:05:09.120 --> 0:05:15.120
we invest in Open Source, and then we have the problem that what we do in Open Source could be

42
0:05:15.120 --> 0:05:24.120
reused by non-European companies. I am thinking, oh, my God. Oh, that's so fucking wrong. Why do

43
0:05:24.120 --> 0:05:31.720
you do that? Why do you do that? So that's really one part of the message I wanted to share today. I

44
0:05:31.720 --> 0:05:40.600
think we agree on that. Still, I think that we should be more diligent in Europe about helping

45
0:05:40.600 --> 0:05:48.720
European organizations, helping European companies, helping universities do Open Source, produce Open

46
0:05:48.720 --> 0:05:56.080
Source, publish Open Source, and also be more ambitious about how to use Open Source as a vector

47
0:05:56.080 --> 0:06:06.760
to project technologies and to project ideas in the rest of the world. We can come back to that.

48
0:06:06.760 --> 0:06:13.800
Yep. So I think, I mean, from my perspective, coming from the European Open Source industry

49
0:06:13.800 --> 0:06:19.240
sector, let's say, as a technology provider, as a company that produces Open Source and makes money

50
0:06:19.240 --> 0:06:25.920
out of the services we provide to customers with this, I mean, I think we share that concern,

51
0:06:25.920 --> 0:06:30.600
that I mean, Open Source cannot be something that in any way limits who's going to use that,

52
0:06:30.600 --> 0:06:36.800
puts any barriers to who can improve the technology or contribute to that technology.

53
0:06:36.800 --> 0:06:43.960
From my perspective, I mean, I've also been involved at several of the European initiatives

54
0:06:43.960 --> 0:06:48.520
for things like data sovereignty and cloud sovereignty, these kinds of discussions,

55
0:06:48.520 --> 0:06:53.320
things like the European Alliance for Industrial Data Edge and Cloud. That's something that the

56
0:06:53.320 --> 0:06:59.800
European Commission launched a couple of years ago. So for me and other people in the sector,

57
0:06:59.800 --> 0:07:05.960
I would say, I think exploring this concept of what European Open Source means is kind of a natural

58
0:07:05.960 --> 0:07:11.720
step after we discuss the problem we have in the market now with cloud providers. So from our

59
0:07:11.720 --> 0:07:17.320
perspective is, okay, we have, we recognize, we identify there's a market failure in Europe in

60
0:07:17.320 --> 0:07:22.880
terms of access to different cloud providers or the dominance of a number of non-European

61
0:07:22.880 --> 0:07:29.600
hyperscalers, you all know the names. Let's fix that because the European players are playing in

62
0:07:29.600 --> 0:07:35.480
this advantage here. So for us, the next step is, okay, so what are the technologies that European

63
0:07:35.480 --> 0:07:41.680
cloud providers are using? Are those led by European organizations? Are those roadmaps

64
0:07:41.680 --> 0:07:48.200
defined in Europe or are those technologies defined and implemented by non-EU companies and

65
0:07:48.200 --> 0:07:53.320
organizations? So for us, it was like the next step, like, okay, what if we apply this sense of this

66
0:07:53.320 --> 0:07:58.880
concept of sovereignty of technological autonomy, let's say, also to the not just the proprietary

67
0:07:58.880 --> 0:08:04.840
software, but the open source software that supports all these cloud infrastructures and

68
0:08:04.840 --> 0:08:12.280
European cloud providers, but other companies as well. Can we do that? I mean, can we get some

69
0:08:12.280 --> 0:08:17.080
understanding of what that will imply for Europe in terms of getting the industry involved in

70
0:08:17.080 --> 0:08:21.800
producing and maintaining the technologies that they consume, not just being mere spectators of

71
0:08:21.800 --> 0:08:26.720
what all the companies and organizations produce outside Europe most of times. So that's the,

72
0:08:26.720 --> 0:08:35.840
that was the kind of the next discussion we had. Any question at some point? Or maybe somebody wants

73
0:08:35.840 --> 0:08:41.120
to shout and I'll say that. What do you think? What do you feel about the concept of European open

74
0:08:41.120 --> 0:09:01.240
source? It's an oxymoron. Why? Yeah, I just don't understand why you put that adjective in front of

75
0:09:01.240 --> 0:09:09.080
this nouns. Right? I mean, it's like, you can do that. It makes dramatic sense, but I don't understand

76
0:09:09.080 --> 0:09:22.760
what the meaning would be. So for me, it's working for the life. Yeah, it's working for the life. I

77
0:09:22.760 --> 0:09:32.600
think, I think we agree. And to be honest, that's definitely not the controversial part in it. I

78
0:09:32.600 --> 0:09:40.960
think that, and to the point is that yes, open source is global and everything that is, that

79
0:09:40.960 --> 0:09:53.040
intends to limit open source scope is certainly not what we want. Still, that's more to not take

80
0:09:53.040 --> 0:09:59.040
it as an adjective, but to take it as a, okay, we have open source, open source is global. And

81
0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:08.920
what we may want as European citizen working for a global organization or as another European citizen

82
0:10:08.920 --> 0:10:19.640
with leading a European company, what we may want is to have a different strategy, like an industry

83
0:10:19.640 --> 0:10:32.640
strategy to sustain and develop open source better differently in Europe. So I completely agree with

84
0:10:32.640 --> 0:10:39.680
that. Yeah. And so that you should have policies and frameworks and a whole bunch of other types of

85
0:10:39.680 --> 0:10:48.800
things. But to do so, let's use that example, right? Water forms the shape of the container that it's

86
0:10:48.800 --> 0:10:58.400
putting. Right? So one, one talks about the, the, what water is, right? One talks about the fact

87
0:10:58.400 --> 0:11:04.880
that it's in a bucket or in a cup or in something because the framework gives the structure to the

88
0:11:04.880 --> 0:11:11.400
water. But you don't talk about whether the water is going to be bucket, bucketed water. Yeah.

89
0:11:11.400 --> 0:11:21.520
We are not, we are not, okay. I'm French in Spanish, so it's possibly grammatically not the right

90
0:11:21.520 --> 0:11:42.760
approach to the topic in English. At least I think that we set the stage for the conversation. Yeah.

91
0:11:42.760 --> 0:11:55.720
So the comment is that it should be European open source industry. Yeah. And that's another aspect

92
0:11:55.720 --> 0:12:02.480
that I like a lot. Yeah. Because for me, I think it's the only concern I've heard, like why this

93
0:12:02.480 --> 0:12:11.280
matters, like is, it's the one about competition. So competition with US and other global companies.

94
0:12:11.280 --> 0:12:19.240
And that is predominantly sort of like an industry concern. I think for example, like there might be

95
0:12:19.240 --> 0:12:24.480
other concerns around sort of like governance of open source projects, like that are based in Europe

96
0:12:24.480 --> 0:12:29.800
or have predominantly sort of a European contributors and things like that. But from my experience,

97
0:12:29.800 --> 0:12:36.560
working with those projects, none of them have sort of, at least intentionally sort of isolationist

98
0:12:36.560 --> 0:12:41.480
sort of like tendencies, they might be isolated just by fact of like, who they know or not to

99
0:12:41.480 --> 0:12:46.360
have diversity of something like that. There's not, yeah, but there's not, it's not, it's less

100
0:12:46.360 --> 0:12:51.440
about lack of outreach rather than we want to be answered. I think most, most of these projects

101
0:12:51.440 --> 0:13:00.160
would rather be not seen as European, but rather as part of more open source movement. You want to

102
0:13:00.160 --> 0:13:07.160
correct? So if we could please just have the seekers call on anyone who wants to speak, we'll

103
0:13:07.160 --> 0:13:13.120
bring the mic to you. And then you have to speak really loudly into the mic. So but please call on

104
0:13:13.120 --> 0:13:21.960
people and let us know. We'll bring the mic to them. Okay. So my take on that is that yes, there

105
0:13:21.960 --> 0:13:27.160
is something that we could define as European open source industry. I think there's also something

106
0:13:27.160 --> 0:13:33.560
we could call the European open source technology. And from my perspective, that is that open source

107
0:13:33.560 --> 0:13:42.120
technology whose roadmap and whose governance is controlled by European organizations. That's

108
0:13:42.120 --> 0:13:49.760
mean external non EU actors cannot or contributors cannot join that community or contribute to that

109
0:13:49.760 --> 0:13:55.760
technology. But the roadmap, the vision of that technology, the values, if you want to talk about

110
0:13:55.760 --> 0:14:01.880
that, the governance bodies that control those technologies are under European hands. Sorry,

111
0:14:01.880 --> 0:14:11.240
before I have, I have slightly different opinion. And my opinion is here on this question seven,

112
0:14:11.240 --> 0:14:20.200
I think that definitely one of the advantages of open source is that we move the needle from having

113
0:14:20.200 --> 0:14:29.760
access to proprietary IP to having the skills to study, to understand, to master, to evolve, to

114
0:14:29.760 --> 0:14:39.400
develop the open source software. And I think that what we need to do, what is what's the next step?

115
0:14:39.400 --> 0:14:48.120
So you represent a relatively small company. And I think that we have a vibrant ecosystem of lots

116
0:14:48.120 --> 0:14:56.680
of small company, small open source companies in Europe. And I think that what we need to do to

117
0:14:56.680 --> 0:15:08.280
go to the next step instead in terms of European power in open source, technology impact in open

118
0:15:08.280 --> 0:15:17.920
source is to involve the larger companies. And in Europe, we have a characteristic which is that

119
0:15:17.920 --> 0:15:25.440
the larger companies are not software companies. With their automotive companies, their aircraft

120
0:15:25.440 --> 0:15:36.840
companies, their utilities, etc. So we have a lot that is being done in terms of policies in engaging

121
0:15:36.840 --> 0:15:45.520
the government. So we have government source pools, etc. But I think that if we really want to get

122
0:15:45.520 --> 0:15:55.440
more leadership from Europe in this topic of global open source, that's really when we manage

123
0:15:55.440 --> 0:16:04.040
to involve the big companies. So we work, for example, with automotive companies, mostly Germans,

124
0:16:04.040 --> 0:16:15.800
but we have Volkswagen, Mercedes, Bosch, Continental, ZF, etc. So that's companies that it's very

125
0:16:15.800 --> 0:16:24.440
interesting. Some of them have been doing software for a very long time, embedded software, etc. And

126
0:16:24.440 --> 0:16:33.000
they are slowly getting to use open source to collaborate together. I think that's very

127
0:16:33.000 --> 0:16:41.880
fundamental because they are likely about to create software that would be game changing for them,

128
0:16:41.880 --> 0:16:50.680
but also for the rest of the industry. So I think that there is a happy battle which is, okay,

129
0:16:50.680 --> 0:16:59.840
what can we do with open source? And on the other side, you have the big, the GAF arm and big

130
0:16:59.840 --> 0:17:07.600
software vendors. We don't have this big software industry in Europe. But open source is really a

131
0:17:07.600 --> 0:17:17.880
tactical and potentially strategic tool that can be used by all our industry. And one of the problems

132
0:17:17.880 --> 0:17:26.360
is that in this industry, all the managers, they have no clue about software. They have no clue

133
0:17:26.360 --> 0:17:34.280
about open source, even less. And so they hear about open source, like, oh, it's open, it's good,

134
0:17:34.280 --> 0:17:44.800
etc. And I think that collectively, we need to propagate the message that, well, doing open

135
0:17:44.800 --> 0:17:50.000
source is, you need to take care about your community, you need to take care, you need to

136
0:17:50.000 --> 0:17:56.960
have a governance, you need to have rules of code of conduct, etc. And so that's really something

137
0:17:56.960 --> 0:18:04.040
that may be counterintuitive for them when you talk to, I don't know, the CEO of an automotive

138
0:18:04.040 --> 0:18:09.560
company that may be counterintuitive for them that open source can be good for them. But I think

139
0:18:09.560 --> 0:18:16.800
that when it will be good for, when they engage with open source, that will also be good for you

140
0:18:16.800 --> 0:18:25.040
because they need you and that will really grow how we collaborate in open source. Because for the

141
0:18:25.040 --> 0:18:31.760
moment, and that's the reaction and what creates the fact that people want to talk about European

142
0:18:31.760 --> 0:18:38.040
open source, that's exactly what you describe in where is the governance. And for the moment,

143
0:18:38.040 --> 0:18:43.680
I can understand the frustration of some European actors, not the system integrators, because system

144
0:18:43.680 --> 0:18:50.120
integrators take the technologies, they create a solution with this technology, and whatever the

145
0:18:50.120 --> 0:18:56.760
technology comes from, they are happy. But for everybody else, to some extent, the fact that

146
0:18:56.760 --> 0:19:07.280
they have these, those open source technologies coming from mostly the US is okay. So what is our

147
0:19:07.280 --> 0:19:17.000
impact on it? Sorry, go ahead. Please, if you want to move away from IP, please do not refer to it as

148
0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:22.320
European open source, but put another word on it, like European open source initiative framework,

149
0:19:22.320 --> 0:19:29.200
community, something that refers to all the aspects aside from the software code. Because when you're

150
0:19:29.200 --> 0:19:34.200
talking about European open source, you think about the code, the IP, and all this stuff, with that,

151
0:19:34.200 --> 0:19:40.760
please use a framework or something that you describe the whole approach. So by the way,

152
0:19:40.760 --> 0:19:48.080
that's leadership. In my mind, more leadership maybe, so we put it somewhere in the screen.

153
0:19:48.080 --> 0:19:58.920
So when you skip away from IP and from non Europeans using open source software, and you can frame it

154
0:19:58.920 --> 0:20:05.160
in a better way. So please refer to it to like an initiative or framework or something that you can

155
0:20:05.160 --> 0:20:19.600
put multiple approaches to it. But please make a big please, please. Okay, just just quickly, I have

156
0:20:19.600 --> 0:20:25.400
one here, then I saw this one next, and there was one up there, then this one, and then here. So I

157
0:20:25.400 --> 0:20:38.920
will try my best. Okay, so this might not only work without the mask. One short question about

158
0:20:38.920 --> 0:20:44.000
the European open source debate. Have you ever considered not to try to frame it as a kind of

159
0:20:44.000 --> 0:20:49.600
license? Because we've seen from the development of the approach of the German carmakers to make

160
0:20:49.600 --> 0:20:56.280
a German car operating system that they paid horribly amounts of pain when they forked off

161
0:20:56.280 --> 0:21:02.680
certain line exports, and spend a triple digit amount of millions and something that they then

162
0:21:02.680 --> 0:21:11.160
had to scroll back. Thus, it might be more useful to go to open source and give them some kind of

163
0:21:11.160 --> 0:21:17.920
label as we are a company and we maintain it, and then eat the liability that comes with using open

164
0:21:17.920 --> 0:21:23.400
source and can be contracted given that the cyber resilience act applies companies in Europe to

165
0:21:23.400 --> 0:21:30.320
actually take the liabilities that come from using open source. So instead of making it a licensed

166
0:21:30.320 --> 0:21:36.040
thing, you basically go to a certain software stack that you maintain that you can still freely

167
0:21:36.040 --> 0:21:42.920
integrate developments from all over the world. And then you basically put a stamp on it like,

168
0:21:42.920 --> 0:21:49.360
if you want to use it, you can contact us and pay us a service level agreement to do the

169
0:21:49.360 --> 0:21:56.120
maintenance for that. And then we will also take the liability with regards to the liability that

170
0:21:56.120 --> 0:22:01.040
will come with the cyber resilience act, where companies have to accept the risks that come from

171
0:22:01.040 --> 0:22:07.320
open source and an IT security aspect. Would that be a different spin to actually fostering a money

172
0:22:07.320 --> 0:22:16.600
flow into European open source companies and actually create a business model? I don't know.

173
0:22:16.600 --> 0:22:33.640
We could try. Just a clarification, I mean, just put something that's going to be a real question

174
0:22:33.640 --> 0:22:39.760
that we'll have to answer in Europe in a few months time, I would say. So let's say we in Europe

175
0:22:39.760 --> 0:22:46.880
decide that we want to develop a specific piece of technology that we think it's crucial for Europe.

176
0:22:46.880 --> 0:22:53.440
We want that piece of technology to be open source. It's going to be funded by with European

177
0:22:53.440 --> 0:23:00.880
fundings and all this. We get, we managed to get the European industry on board, not just as a

178
0:23:00.880 --> 0:23:06.040
consumers of passive consumers of open source, but as active maintainers and developers of open

179
0:23:06.040 --> 0:23:14.400
source around this technology. And we want this technology in the long term to respond to European,

180
0:23:14.400 --> 0:23:23.280
to the priorities of the European Union in terms of the industry and the geostrategic priorities of

181
0:23:23.280 --> 0:23:30.840
the continent. We want that technology to respond to that. But how can we protect that from the

182
0:23:30.840 --> 0:23:39.040
same technology? It's a hyperscaler contributing with a thousand developers to that project and

183
0:23:39.040 --> 0:23:46.440
taking over the governance structures of that project. So how can we from that scenario protect

184
0:23:46.440 --> 0:23:53.920
that open source technology as I define that? Is that a way we can do that without excluding

185
0:23:53.920 --> 0:23:59.040
non-European companies from the government's bodies? I'm asking, because that's going to be a

186
0:23:59.040 --> 0:24:03.960
point to have to respond in a few weeks time enough. Sorry, in a few months time with thinking

187
0:24:03.960 --> 0:24:08.000
all the specific piece of technology that will be developing in Europe by the end of this year.

188
0:24:08.000 --> 0:24:14.720
It's probably going to be the largest open source project in Europe. Yeah, sorry.

189
0:24:14.720 --> 0:24:25.760
So here's next and then there was one over there, another over there, then over here and then over

190
0:24:25.760 --> 0:24:32.960
there. So yeah, a real quick question maybe, hopefully. I find it very difficult to discuss

191
0:24:32.960 --> 0:24:38.480
these topics in abstract terms. So I wonder, do you have concrete examples where kind of important

192
0:24:38.480 --> 0:24:44.800
open source projects, their project management, the governance exercise or, you know, the development

193
0:24:44.800 --> 0:24:51.800
happened against interests of European consumers, contributors. And if you have such concrete cases,

194
0:24:51.800 --> 0:24:58.080
do you know whether this is because the Europeans didn't get involved or because the decision was

195
0:24:58.080 --> 0:25:06.640
really done against them though they were engaged? Do you want to answer? Go ahead. Well, I mean,

196
0:25:06.640 --> 0:25:14.480
in terms of open source projects that are largely controlled, let's say, by non-EU companies or

197
0:25:14.480 --> 0:25:20.360
vendors, I mean, there are a number of examples there. You want me to give you some names?

198
0:25:20.360 --> 0:25:25.160
Not examples for the projects that I can understand, but where the decisions project

199
0:25:25.160 --> 0:25:30.720
management happened against European interests. I know that many open source projects are of course

200
0:25:30.720 --> 0:25:37.640
led by US companies and organizations and so forth, but I'm explicitly asking for, you know,

201
0:25:37.640 --> 0:25:44.520
controversial decisions, project management governance because... Sorry, so he's asking me

202
0:25:44.520 --> 0:25:51.480
for a specific examples in which European companies have been sidelined by in some decisions in open

203
0:25:51.480 --> 0:26:02.080
source projects. I don't know. Doesn't matter. It's about the risk. It's risk management. So how we

204
0:26:02.080 --> 0:26:08.080
prevent things from happening, how we prevent things, vendors from dropping their support to

205
0:26:08.080 --> 0:26:14.400
an open source project overnight and collapsing the sustainability of that project because

206
0:26:14.400 --> 0:26:20.040
in Europe we have relied for so long on non-European companies to develop these technologies and

207
0:26:20.040 --> 0:26:27.480
maintain them that we've lost the skills and the capabilities to take over. That's the problem.

208
0:26:27.480 --> 0:26:31.040
We're talking about thousands of millions of euros invested in technology. I'll give you an example

209
0:26:31.040 --> 0:26:34.920
of that. There's something called the important project of common European interest on next

210
0:26:34.920 --> 0:26:41.000
generation proud infrastructure and services. IPSI this. That's mobilizing thousands of millions

211
0:26:41.000 --> 0:26:47.360
from European funding to create a whole alternative stack of technologies for managing the cloud and

212
0:26:47.360 --> 0:26:53.360
the edge in Europe. That's only for European companies and that is going to produce, I think,

213
0:26:53.360 --> 0:27:00.440
in my opinion, the largest ever open source project in Europe. How we protect that if we open it up to

214
0:27:00.440 --> 0:27:07.040
Google, AWS, Microsoft, the technology... I mean the companies for whom this technology is being

215
0:27:07.040 --> 0:27:11.360
designed to neutralize their dominance in the market and prevent them from taking over the

216
0:27:11.360 --> 0:27:22.080
edge computing market as well. That's a practical problem. That's a topic on which we will likely

217
0:27:22.080 --> 0:27:28.480
disagree but that's fine. That's why we have a conversation. I think because from my perspective,

218
0:27:28.480 --> 0:27:40.080
I think that if you talk about IPSI, if you talk about edge computing projects, I think that there

219
0:27:40.080 --> 0:27:52.720
are effectively millions of euros that are spent on helping European companies and that means

220
0:27:52.720 --> 0:28:00.880
companies with headquarters in Europe because I remember I was in such a project and one of the

221
0:28:00.880 --> 0:28:08.760
comments we had when it was rejected is that you cannot get this specific funding because some

222
0:28:08.760 --> 0:28:19.280
partners are not European. That's not a team. That's not just a company with a subsidiary in

223
0:28:19.280 --> 0:28:30.800
Europe. We have the funding mechanism. That's already in place. Next, the question is not how

224
0:28:30.800 --> 0:28:37.760
do we restrict some of the funding to help European companies. The question is how do we make it

225
0:28:37.760 --> 0:28:48.880
effective? I think that we have a fundamental problem in Europe about that. We spend lots of

226
0:28:48.880 --> 0:28:54.480
money and at some point in research projects, I don't know if you have been involved in those

227
0:28:54.480 --> 0:29:00.600
research projects, but in research or innovation projects, we tell people, A, you need to do open

228
0:29:00.600 --> 0:29:07.960
source. Some of them, and I would say 80% of them maybe, understand that they just need to publish

229
0:29:07.960 --> 0:29:17.880
abandonware on GitHub to check the green box. They think, oh, come on. We published in open source.

230
0:29:17.880 --> 0:29:26.000
I think that we also have to do our part and to understand that, yes, when you do open source,

231
0:29:26.000 --> 0:29:35.160
you need to build a community, you need to build a governance, you need to... I imagine, I dream

232
0:29:35.160 --> 0:29:43.640
maybe that a group of European companies, because they identify that a project that has been created

233
0:29:43.640 --> 0:29:53.440
somewhere else is very important for them, takes over, sends enough developers in a meritocratic

234
0:29:53.440 --> 0:30:00.480
environment to take over the governance of the project and to have more commuters, et cetera.

235
0:30:00.480 --> 0:30:11.040
So I think there is... I know in most countries, in most continents, we can see some protectionist

236
0:30:11.040 --> 0:30:21.840
approach and I don't like it. And my organization doesn't like it either. But I think that it's

237
0:30:21.840 --> 0:30:32.120
really exactly... We should exactly do the opposite. That we have the framework to fund some

238
0:30:32.120 --> 0:30:38.760
developments. We have the incentive or we have the requirement to make the development open source.

239
0:30:38.760 --> 0:30:50.400
The problem is that at some point, it is lost in some of fine-grained open source initiatives

240
0:30:50.400 --> 0:30:55.440
that never reach a critical mass. So of course, when I say that, I have an interest, is that,

241
0:30:55.440 --> 0:31:00.400
okay, at the European Foundation, we can help people group together to reach such a critical

242
0:31:00.400 --> 0:31:06.920
mass. But I mean it. I mean that there are plenty of open source foundations, as the Apache

243
0:31:06.920 --> 0:31:13.520
Foundation. We are here in Europe and we are incorporated in Europe, post-it code in Europe.

244
0:31:13.520 --> 0:31:24.080
And I want to see more critical mass of people and companies who group together and have the

245
0:31:24.080 --> 0:31:33.680
ambition not to be reactive, but to really just create the next technology for edge computing,

246
0:31:33.680 --> 0:31:39.080
for example. And the next technology for edge computing, that will be open source. Whether

247
0:31:39.080 --> 0:31:45.160
it's a started bootstrap in Europe or it's bootstrap in the US or it's bootstrap in China,

248
0:31:45.160 --> 0:31:53.960
everybody at some point will converge to a few of those technologies. So we need to do better

249
0:31:53.960 --> 0:32:03.160
when we do open source. I don't say that for you. No, I agree. I mean, there's no discussion about

250
0:32:03.160 --> 0:32:08.760
that. So I can tell you the next big tool for edge cloud in Europe is going to be open source.

251
0:32:08.760 --> 0:32:15.280
So and that's it. And that involves the main industrial actors in the continent. So that's

252
0:32:15.280 --> 0:32:19.960
a fact. We only have, it has to be approved by Digi competition and all that, but that's

253
0:32:19.960 --> 0:32:25.960
minor details. But if that happens and goes well, we'll have a five-year project, five-year long

254
0:32:25.960 --> 0:32:31.120
project developing some first class open source in Europe. And I agree with you. We have to

255
0:32:31.120 --> 0:32:38.640
mobilize, I mean, the whole community beyond the small technology providers and we have to invest

256
0:32:38.640 --> 0:32:43.880
those fundings better and more strategically as well. So as a company, for instance, I would love

257
0:32:43.880 --> 0:32:49.960
if European projects hadn't been a horizon Europe or research and innovation projects hadn't been

258
0:32:49.960 --> 0:32:56.040
spending this money in small pieces of software to contribute to open a stack, for instance,

259
0:32:56.040 --> 0:33:03.000
which is our competitor and not to open Nebula or some other European providers. So the large,

260
0:33:03.000 --> 0:33:07.680
one of the most striking things of the thing with the work we've been doing a couple of years is

261
0:33:07.680 --> 0:33:13.520
bringing the main European open source providers into the European research and innovation

262
0:33:13.520 --> 0:33:19.000
ecosystem because they weren't there. People like SUSE like MariaDB, limited. I mean, these people

263
0:33:19.000 --> 0:33:25.120
have never ever considered even accessing trying to get this funding or contributing to research

264
0:33:25.120 --> 0:33:31.080
and innovation projects in Europe. On the other hand, we find most of the US open source vendors,

265
0:33:31.080 --> 0:33:35.920
but also cloud providers very well in the decision in that area. So that's something we also have to

266
0:33:35.920 --> 0:33:42.160
work on to mobilize all these resources to actually help European open source companies

267
0:33:42.160 --> 0:33:45.800
being more sustainable in the long term and get these contributions more more fluently.

268
0:33:45.800 --> 0:33:53.240
So we have a question over here. Afterwards, I registered a question here, then one over there,

269
0:33:53.240 --> 0:34:02.040
then I saw one over here and I saw one at the front. One request, if you want to ask a question,

270
0:34:02.040 --> 0:34:08.600
please put your hand up and then try to get eye contact with me, then I can acknowledge that I

271
0:34:08.600 --> 0:34:15.160
saw you. It's also a little bit difficult in this large room. So handing over. So what I think is

272
0:34:15.160 --> 0:34:23.120
that like back to maybe this definition part where we have European open source, I feel like the open

273
0:34:23.120 --> 0:34:33.880
source part of that is very much global. So it shouldn't be localized to any area really.

274
0:34:33.880 --> 0:34:42.320
And then we have in Europe, what we should maybe improve on is the like those two aspects,

275
0:34:42.320 --> 0:34:48.720
the using open source software and the creating open source software. And I can't exactly speak

276
0:34:48.720 --> 0:34:55.640
for those major projects, which are like funded by huge companies either in Europe or mostly in

277
0:34:55.640 --> 0:35:02.720
the US right now. But what I see is just a lot of individual projects from individual people who

278
0:35:02.720 --> 0:35:09.320
just contribute to open source, perhaps even their free time or small company or whatever.

279
0:35:09.320 --> 0:35:17.040
And right, but they still are, they are still the backbone of maybe an entire industry without

280
0:35:17.040 --> 0:35:27.520
that industry even realizing. So I feel like this is where we as maybe the European Union or as Europe

281
0:35:27.520 --> 0:35:36.480
in general could dramatically improve on is just to focus on those essential projects. I mean,

282
0:35:36.480 --> 0:35:48.320
there's this, I forgot the name, a German fund for exactly those projects kind of project that

283
0:35:48.320 --> 0:36:00.760
like the base project kind of small, but still really important. Yeah, exactly. Right. So I would

284
0:36:00.760 --> 0:36:08.240
love to see more of these kinds of initiatives. And I think that's really important. Not, I mean,

285
0:36:08.240 --> 0:36:16.400
I don't know if like those government as governance aspects of open source are even that important.

286
0:36:16.400 --> 0:36:22.200
I see it if we are actually the main consumer of something or we have specific goals we want to

287
0:36:22.200 --> 0:36:34.600
realize in open source as Europe, but just I feel like just empowering those individuals or

288
0:36:34.600 --> 0:36:42.560
companies or anyone who's contributing to important open source projects, regardless of if they are

289
0:36:42.560 --> 0:36:55.520
have a government's role or not is really beneficial. Yeah. Well, I like the topic of empowering people.

290
0:36:55.520 --> 0:37:08.280
I think that when we also when we fund open source, we have a topic is that sometimes maybe we don't

291
0:37:08.280 --> 0:37:21.200
have enough money going down to the developers because, you know, I mean, in some of the places

292
0:37:21.200 --> 0:37:28.480
where I hear a lot about open source, open source, open source, open source, sometimes I hardly find

293
0:37:28.480 --> 0:37:37.480
the developers. And that's so that's we have the problem on the two sides of the spectrum. I mean,

294
0:37:37.480 --> 0:37:47.160
we have under policy aspect, we have policy people who are talking about open source and that's fine.

295
0:37:47.160 --> 0:37:54.840
I think that we need to potentially do better to characterize what we mean by open source and to

296
0:37:54.840 --> 0:38:02.160
make it better consumable by the policy people. And on the other side, we have also, I think the

297
0:38:02.160 --> 0:38:12.840
romantic view of open source being done by individuals, like what you describe, I think that

298
0:38:12.840 --> 0:38:18.760
we have especially here at first day, okay, we have all the individuals coming for the weekend,

299
0:38:18.760 --> 0:38:26.080
etc, all the volunteers, but I think that even in the room, we have also lots of people who are

300
0:38:26.080 --> 0:38:34.560
doing open source for their day job. So that's, I think that I understand the individual aspect.

301
0:38:34.560 --> 0:38:42.240
I think that there are also lots of projects that are not really supported by individuals,

302
0:38:42.240 --> 0:38:49.840
but by some kind of organizations that requires those projects. And I think that after her bleed

303
0:38:49.840 --> 0:38:58.840
and workforce share, etc, things that to some extent, the industry is embracing the topic and

304
0:38:58.840 --> 0:39:10.120
trying to, how do you call it, do better and potentially hire those individuals and contract

305
0:39:10.120 --> 0:39:20.960
your basis, etc, to take care of it. I mean, that's something, you know, any of you attended

306
0:39:20.960 --> 0:39:28.320
the open forum Europe summit yesterday, but it was an interesting, if you can go, recommend if

307
0:39:28.320 --> 0:39:40.000
you look at the talk by the CEO of GitHub, right? It's very interesting. He was arguing

308
0:39:40.000 --> 0:39:46.240
about the AI act and how open source would be left outside the scope of the AI act because of the

309
0:39:46.240 --> 0:39:52.240
nature of open source being run mainly by individuals. But then the contrast is when

310
0:39:52.240 --> 0:39:57.360
you go to argue against the cyber resilience act, then the argument changes and it says,

311
0:39:57.360 --> 0:40:03.600
look, I mean, we are companies, every open source is at some point commercial. So I think we have

312
0:40:03.600 --> 0:40:12.240
to again discuss within, especially in Europe as well, how we explain what we do, how we explain

313
0:40:12.240 --> 0:40:16.360
what the community is and it changes from different parts of the, I mean, if you look at the technology

314
0:40:16.360 --> 0:40:20.520
stack and different projects, I mean, some projects are run by volunteers, some projects are run entirely

315
0:40:20.520 --> 0:40:24.880
by the communities, some of the projects are run by companies alone. I mean, our project, we run it

316
0:40:24.880 --> 0:40:29.360
alone. I mean, we control the roadmap, we control the releases and you can, you're free to contribute

317
0:40:29.360 --> 0:40:34.280
with the site, we accept that or not. And that's it. Other projects, they have a different governance.

318
0:40:34.280 --> 0:40:40.480
It's a community of companies and they somehow benefit from that shirt and that shirt knowledge

319
0:40:40.480 --> 0:40:45.680
and that's perfectly fine. They collaboration among competitors and that's perfectly okay. I mean,

320
0:40:45.680 --> 0:40:52.520
there are different models and I think they are all okay, but each of them have their own particularities.

321
0:40:52.520 --> 0:40:57.960
So this concept of sovereignty in Europe, I think it's especially relevant for those

322
0:40:57.960 --> 0:41:05.160
projects in which they are mainly maintained and controlled by companies, by open source companies

323
0:41:05.160 --> 0:41:12.320
or other companies. So that's just to frame a bit the discussion, I mean, from my perspective.

324
0:41:12.320 --> 0:41:17.960
So those are the kind of projects that for me personally and for others create some concern in

325
0:41:17.960 --> 0:41:22.240
terms of if we develop these projects in Europe and we have this ambition of having the European

326
0:41:22.240 --> 0:41:26.640
industry heavily involved in maintaining these projects, how we protect these technologies in

327
0:41:26.640 --> 0:41:34.080
these communities from the very same companies we are creating this technology, not against,

328
0:41:34.080 --> 0:41:47.240
but you understand me, right? I would like to come back to the European project and I think

329
0:41:47.240 --> 0:41:55.480
it's really important. We want to be democratic. It means freedom and seeing what's happening right

330
0:41:55.480 --> 0:42:02.600
now in the world, it's like, woohoo! So democracy and sustainability, I think it's part of the

331
0:42:02.600 --> 0:42:10.600
European project and so how can we be leaders in and I prefer free software because free is in

332
0:42:10.600 --> 0:42:19.120
freedom not as in free beer. How can we use that for interoperability that leads to right to

333
0:42:19.120 --> 0:42:26.360
repair and that helps sustainability in the long run. So how can we put open source European software

334
0:42:26.360 --> 0:42:33.920
to help build the European way of doing stuff, if I can say it like that. And I think that the

335
0:42:33.920 --> 0:42:43.760
adversary of European open source software is international closed software more than international

336
0:42:43.760 --> 0:42:52.680
open source software. I don't know. When I see that all the better universities are sold to Microsoft,

337
0:42:52.680 --> 0:43:03.480
we have a problem. And how can we change that using European companies that are using open

338
0:43:03.480 --> 0:43:16.640
source software? Yeah, I mean, that's a couple of big questions. I think as we see this debate

339
0:43:16.640 --> 0:43:26.840
taking place, I think at certain parts of the technological world, let's say, part of this

340
0:43:26.840 --> 0:43:34.280
stack, we are happily beyond the debate between open source or proprietary source. I mean, that's

341
0:43:34.280 --> 0:43:44.600
something I understand in some other areas is not that clear. I mean, it's a daily sale. You have to

342
0:43:44.600 --> 0:43:52.440
fight a lot with users and other companies to trust open source. In some parts, in some areas,

343
0:43:52.440 --> 0:44:00.720
that's I think we are we are beyond that. So I'll tell you a very, very small anecdote. We have the

344
0:44:00.720 --> 0:44:06.680
General Assembly of the industrial, what's the name? European Alliance for Industrial Data,

345
0:44:06.680 --> 0:44:13.040
Edge and Cloud in December, for instance. It's only for it's a it's a it's a body of it's an

346
0:44:13.040 --> 0:44:18.280
alliance, industry alliance set by the Commission or supported by the Commission led by the industry

347
0:44:18.280 --> 0:44:23.760
only for European companies. Okay, we we are defining the roadmap, the technological roadmap

348
0:44:23.760 --> 0:44:29.280
for for the cloud and the edge and edge. A bit of such promotion happened out of talk at five in

349
0:44:29.280 --> 0:44:33.960
the sovereign cloud that room about the specifics of this initiative. So we are defining the

350
0:44:33.960 --> 0:44:38.560
technological priorities that we need the Commission to help us co fund in the next year

351
0:44:38.560 --> 0:44:45.440
of around edge cloud and data only for Europeans and when we have this this General Assembly here

352
0:44:45.440 --> 0:44:51.840
in Brussels in December. There are three working groups, the cloud and its working group, the one

353
0:44:51.840 --> 0:44:57.160
for member states, members from different governments. And there's there's an specific

354
0:44:57.160 --> 0:45:05.120
working group for for the fence and aeronautic sector. And for me personally, I'm old enough to

355
0:45:05.120 --> 0:45:12.520
have seen some changes in the sector. For me, watching at this five representatives across Europe

356
0:45:12.520 --> 0:45:23.720
from the main defense companies saying they they understand I mean, they want to use open source,

357
0:45:23.720 --> 0:45:32.560
they do want to use open source, they just need help to use open source, but they want that was

358
0:45:32.560 --> 0:45:38.200
that was surprising for me. Okay, it's it's the defense sector. Okay. But you know, I mean, this

359
0:45:38.200 --> 0:45:43.600
is people with a very specific mindset and very critical projects and very, very hard requirements

360
0:45:43.600 --> 0:45:47.880
on the contracts they get all that stuff. They were saying we want to we want to use open source,

361
0:45:47.880 --> 0:45:53.200
we just need to see how to actually put it under the requirements we have in this in the sector,

362
0:45:53.200 --> 0:45:57.480
because because that's what we want to do. And they want to contribute to these projects,

363
0:45:57.480 --> 0:46:02.560
they we just need to tell them how exactly with their peculiarities and their particularities. But

364
0:46:02.560 --> 0:46:09.200
in some areas, we're happily beyond that discussion. And we are I think mature, I mean, the market in

365
0:46:09.200 --> 0:46:15.080
that area, so the sector is mature enough to get into the nuances of what do we mean by open source,

366
0:46:15.080 --> 0:46:20.480
who's controlling open these open source, who's developing this, what are the risks of taking

367
0:46:20.480 --> 0:46:26.280
assuming or using this technology or that other technology? I mean, obviously, I have to confess

368
0:46:26.280 --> 0:46:31.760
that that's a debate is a small open source European company, this is an environment that benefits the

369
0:46:31.760 --> 0:46:38.880
small company like us and others, because it helps us differentiate from others. But that's what it

370
0:46:38.880 --> 0:46:44.200
is. I mean, we have the European open source sector, you know what it is. I mean, we have a few larger

371
0:46:44.200 --> 0:46:48.640
companies, but most of us are smaller, even if we have been for years, producing very good

372
0:46:48.640 --> 0:46:55.000
technologies, I think. But that's that's what it is. So the question. So we have one last question.

373
0:46:55.000 --> 0:47:00.840
Yeah, I saw many others registered this. But we can't take any further questions after this one.

374
0:47:00.840 --> 0:47:06.240
So I'm very sorry about those who gave their sign to me. And we can't take your question.

375
0:47:06.240 --> 0:47:12.600
Thank you. It's not so much a question anymore, given the time, but I think given what's on the

376
0:47:12.600 --> 0:47:17.760
slide right now, as you've been open source, I think you talk a lot about governance of it. I

377
0:47:17.760 --> 0:47:23.320
think it's about dependence on external actors, which are not a year, but I think we want to be

378
0:47:23.320 --> 0:47:33.080
self sovereign, as it's now the type. But I think we should have expertise in it. It doesn't

379
0:47:33.080 --> 0:47:38.200
necessarily need to be European development. We need European expertise to judge it. And if

380
0:47:38.200 --> 0:47:43.000
somebody decides to stop that, we can take over. It's not so much that we created in the first

381
0:47:43.000 --> 0:47:48.600
place, but we need to build the expertise not only in development, but also in knowledge about using

382
0:47:48.600 --> 0:47:57.160
it, promoting it. I think that's one of the things we just lack education. Exactly. We need more

383
0:47:57.160 --> 0:48:01.880
education on both development and promotion of open source and using it. I think that's the thing.

384
0:48:01.880 --> 0:48:09.640
We need European education on this. I think we agree on that. And in order to see my, when I

385
0:48:09.640 --> 0:48:19.240
put that sentence, and again, I'm French that maybe incorrect English, but my goal was that to

386
0:48:19.240 --> 0:48:30.840
bring us to quickly conclude that the short answer is no. But I think that we must have a European

387
0:48:30.840 --> 0:48:37.960
industry, our industrial strategy for open source. And I think that we at least can agree on that.

388
0:48:38.680 --> 0:48:48.200
And we have lots of talks about open source in the European setup. And it was mentioned in one

389
0:48:48.200 --> 0:48:59.240
of the questions with the CRA. And I think that, okay, on one side, for me, that's really interesting

390
0:48:59.240 --> 0:49:09.960
to see that the cyber residence act mentions open source as an exception. But the way it mentions

391
0:49:09.960 --> 0:49:17.320
open source as an exception is something that is almost not acceptable for lots of people in open

392
0:49:17.320 --> 0:49:25.080
source, because that creates lots of concerns. And so on one side, we have incentives, lots of

393
0:49:25.080 --> 0:49:32.200
incentives to do more open source in Europe. And on the other side, we are creating regulations that

394
0:49:32.200 --> 0:49:40.680
could break the way to redistribute software. So that would really be a problem. And that was

395
0:49:40.680 --> 0:49:45.880
my conclusion. So your conclusion, and we are done. My conclusion is that the time's up.

396
0:49:45.880 --> 0:49:53.880
Thank you, everyone.
