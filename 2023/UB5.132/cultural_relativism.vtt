WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
And without further ado, I will now turn it over to Yield the Floor to Claude.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
Does this work?

00:12.160 --> 00:13.160
Thank you very much, sir.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.160
Can you hear me?

00:14.160 --> 00:15.160
Is this work?

00:15.160 --> 00:16.160
Thank you.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.160
Okay.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.760
I'm here today to talk about cultural relativism as a prison for constructing cross-cultural

00:22.760 --> 00:24.760
communities.

00:24.760 --> 00:30.200
And let me start first by saying that the opinions expressed in this talk are mine.

00:30.200 --> 00:36.040
They don't necessarily reflect FOSDEM, my employer, or the projects that I work on.

00:36.040 --> 00:42.440
And in the course of this talk, there may be images or phrases that offend, but any

00:42.440 --> 00:47.720
such offense comes from lack of knowledge on my part and is unintentional.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.760
So who am I?

00:49.760 --> 00:52.280
I'm Claude Warren.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.920
I am a member of the Apache Foundation.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.360
I've been a member and a leader of cross-cultural teams.

00:57.360 --> 01:01.680
You can see my social media links there.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.560
I'm not on Wikipedia.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
That's my father.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.320
And if you look my father up, you will also find a link to my mother.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.000
And if you look them both up, you will find that they went to Northwestern University,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.680
where they became immersed in the practice and theory of cultural relativism.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.920
They were students of Melville Herskovitz, who was himself a student of Franz Boas, who

01:22.920 --> 01:28.280
we will get to in a moment, but just try to say that both of my parents were cultural

01:28.280 --> 01:33.120
relativists, and I grew up in a framework of cultural relativism.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.440
So let's start by defining culture.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.160
Culture is learned behavior.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.760
It's what you learn in your social framework.

01:41.760 --> 01:47.120
So it's what you learn from your family, from your friends, from your school, your city,

01:47.120 --> 01:50.560
your state, your country, that all have a culture that influences you and helps you

01:50.560 --> 01:55.320
develop your culture, activities you participate in.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.960
Any place that people gather, you develop a culture.

02:00.960 --> 02:06.920
So as an example, culture is not that you eat, but what you eat.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.120
On the left here is a picture of a durian fruit.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.280
Comes from Southeast Asia.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.360
There are signs in the Singapore transit stations that say, don't bring this in the station,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.640
don't bring it on the vehicles.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.040
It's an acquired taste.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.440
I tried to acquire it.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.440
I couldn't.

02:21.440 --> 02:28.320
I'm told that it is just absolutely lovely once you've acquired that taste, but to me,

02:28.320 --> 02:34.320
it smells like rotting flesh, and I just couldn't get past it.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.760
So the second one, obviously, is a cow.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.920
Most of the people in this room are going to look at that cow and say, cow, milk, cheese,

02:42.920 --> 02:47.800
butter, maybe leather, beef, perhaps.

02:47.800 --> 02:56.160
But if you're Hindu, that's a sacred animal, and none of those things will probably come

02:56.160 --> 02:59.720
to mind.

02:59.720 --> 03:06.120
So let's look at another culturally determined perception.

03:06.120 --> 03:11.620
So it's not that you perceive time, but how you perceive it.

03:11.620 --> 03:19.220
So the Amaya people in the high Andes perceive time that the past is in front of them.

03:19.220 --> 03:22.540
So for about seven generations, as they're talking about people, they will speak as though

03:22.540 --> 03:24.640
that person is in front of them.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.480
And then beyond that, time goes left to right.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.900
But this means that the future is behind them.

03:30.900 --> 03:37.720
So for us, Back to the Future is a great play on words and a fantastic movie title.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
To the Amaya, it's the way they perceive time.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.960
It's the normal way to perceive things.

03:43.960 --> 03:50.560
So to tell somebody from the Amaya culture to go forward to the future would sound just

03:50.560 --> 03:54.120
as ridiculous as somebody telling us to go backwards to the future.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.120
Okay.

03:55.120 --> 04:01.960
So now that we have some idea of the kinds of things that are involved in culture, let's

04:01.960 --> 04:05.120
look at cultural relativism.

04:05.120 --> 04:10.400
So cultural relativism is the idea that you can only understand beliefs and practices

04:10.400 --> 04:13.760
from within the construct of the culture itself.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.920
Now this is separate from moral relativism, which we're not going to talk about today.

04:18.920 --> 04:23.960
Cultural relativism has been used recently to make arguments for the continuation of

04:23.960 --> 04:28.840
human rights offenses on the grounds that are culturally based.

04:28.840 --> 04:35.800
In anthropology, cultural relativism is a means to get outside of your culture and understand

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
another.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.560
So it's how do you step outside of your culture and get rid of those biases so that you can

04:40.560 --> 04:44.120
understand what's happening in another culture.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.800
But for people who are managing cross-cultural teams or multicultural teams, we can use cultural

04:48.800 --> 04:54.160
relativism as a prism through which we can discover miscommunication and we can discuss

04:54.160 --> 05:00.040
interactions between members.

05:00.040 --> 05:07.360
Cultural relativism was first recorded as a concept by Herodotus, who was a Greek historian

05:07.360 --> 05:10.160
from 484 to 425 BCE.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.400
He was writing about Darius the Great.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.640
Darius the Great was a Persian ruler from 522 to 486 BCE.

05:19.640 --> 05:24.480
Darius was inquiring about funerary customs in his empire, and as you can see, his empire

05:24.480 --> 05:26.880
was fairly vast.

05:26.880 --> 05:32.640
Now it turns out that in the eastern edge of his empire, the funerary custom was funerary

05:32.640 --> 05:34.520
cannibalism.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.520
And on the western edge, it was cremation.

05:37.520 --> 05:46.200
When those two populations were told about the custom of the other population, they both

05:46.200 --> 05:48.840
were dismayed and abhorred the other process.

05:48.840 --> 05:55.840
This is the first recorded case of this concept of cultural relativism.

05:55.840 --> 06:02.920
Now it was established as axiomatic in anthropology in the early 20th century by Franz Boas.

06:02.920 --> 06:09.600
Franz Boas was appointed professor of anthropology at Columbia University in the States in 1899.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.720
He is called the father of American anthropology.

06:13.720 --> 06:20.240
He first articulated the idea of cultural relativism in 1887, but he didn't coin the

06:20.240 --> 06:21.800
term.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
That fell to Alan Locke.

06:23.600 --> 06:29.120
Now Alan Locke is the first African-American Rhodes scholar.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.480
He was reviewing his book by Robert Lowey.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.520
And Robert Lowey was a student of Franz Boas and was writing about cultural relativism.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.520
He was a cultural relativist as opposed to a cultural evolutionist, which was popular

06:45.520 --> 06:48.440
in the Victorian era.

06:48.440 --> 06:54.640
And when reviewing his book, Alan Locke was talking about Robert Lowey's extreme cultural

06:54.640 --> 06:59.200
relativism, and that's the first time the phrase occurs in print.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Okay.

07:00.200 --> 07:05.080
So why do we care about cultural relativism?

07:05.080 --> 07:09.400
We care about cultural relativism because the tools that anthropologists and ethnographers

07:09.400 --> 07:20.240
built to understand the culture we can use to find the friction points between cultures

07:20.240 --> 07:22.080
in our cross-cultural teams.

07:22.080 --> 07:28.800
And those friction points are going to lead to misunderstandings.

07:28.800 --> 07:33.200
Misunderstandings can lead to a cohesive breakdown within the team where people on the team think

07:33.200 --> 07:37.640
they're being undercut or that other people are working against them, sabotaging their

07:37.640 --> 07:39.720
efforts.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.760
It can also lead to a misunderstanding of what your work assignment is.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.680
What is it that we're trying to build?

07:45.680 --> 07:50.840
And if you get that wrong, you're apt to build the wrong tool altogether and your project

07:50.840 --> 08:00.320
will have high potential to fail and cause failure of the project.

08:00.320 --> 08:06.960
So let's look at a couple of examples of cultural relativism in action.

08:06.960 --> 08:07.960
Top light.

08:07.960 --> 08:14.720
Well, as it says here, without the exception of people with color vision deficiencies,

08:14.720 --> 08:16.920
everybody perceives color the same way.

08:16.920 --> 08:25.200
The light enters your eye, hits the cone, nerves fire, brain gets the message, color.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.120
Except some languages have no word for the color green.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.440
They instead use the color yellow or blue.

08:34.440 --> 08:40.640
So for those cultures that use those languages, stop light only has two colors.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.000
And the phrase go on green makes no sense.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.960
In Irish, the color of a person is the color of their hair.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
Okay?

08:52.960 --> 08:58.960
So Eric the red, okay, he wasn't Irish, but you get the idea.

08:58.960 --> 09:04.380
If you want to speak about a person of color, so a dark complected person, that person

09:04.380 --> 09:07.540
is blue.

09:07.540 --> 09:16.600
So the translation of black lives matter and blue lives matter into Irish becomes the same

09:16.600 --> 09:19.240
phrase.

09:19.240 --> 09:26.060
So a distinction that is so important and so prevalent in American US culture is lost

09:26.060 --> 09:31.000
in translation.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.200
So talk about icons, phrases, phrases and gestures are all culturally centered and that

09:38.200 --> 09:39.440
is rather obnoxious.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.520
So let me make him stop.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.360
All right.

09:44.360 --> 09:51.160
So the thumbs up gesture generally means okay, all good, let's proceed, something along that

09:51.160 --> 09:54.440
line, some sort of approval.

09:54.440 --> 10:00.040
However in some cultures that is a rude gesture.

10:00.040 --> 10:04.880
In ancient Rome it was contrary to popular belief the symbol that the gladiator should

10:04.880 --> 10:07.920
be put to death.

10:07.920 --> 10:19.200
In addition, in online forums, the definition has begun to modify and it is becoming, changing

10:19.200 --> 10:25.960
from approval to really a passive aggressive way to shut down a conversation.

10:25.960 --> 10:34.040
So all of this indicates that symbols, the meaning of symbols drifts over time and space.

10:34.040 --> 10:40.640
Now I moved from the US to Ireland a little over 10 years ago and discovered that there

10:40.640 --> 10:45.200
are two countries separated by a common language.

10:45.200 --> 10:51.640
For example, the phrase just about as in I just about caught the bus.

10:51.640 --> 10:57.080
Now in the US he would say I just about caught the bus, that means I ran after it and it

10:57.080 --> 10:58.400
left without me.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.520
I missed it.

11:00.520 --> 11:04.920
In Ireland, I just about caught the bus means I ran after it and I, my gosh, I managed to

11:04.920 --> 11:08.600
get on the thing and I got a lift.

11:08.600 --> 11:17.600
So they describe the same phrase both in English, both in a Western culture, describe two sides

11:17.600 --> 11:22.160
for opposite outcomes of the same event.

11:22.160 --> 11:27.320
So idioms are obviously another source of misunderstanding.

11:27.320 --> 11:33.680
So phrases like there's more than one way to skin a cat, which means there's more than

11:33.680 --> 11:41.880
one solution and is perfectly acceptable in a lot of cultures but there is obviously a

11:41.880 --> 11:43.240
chance of misunderstanding here.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.240
I actually had somebody ask me why would you skin a cat?

11:48.240 --> 11:56.800
Valid question but I don't know, that's just one of those things I learned in my culture.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.080
And then we'll get to the nodding head guy now.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.960
In general we think of that as the nodding head meaning yes.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.880
But in Bulgarian culture that means no.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.040
And in fact shaking your head from side to side means yes.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.840
Go figure.

12:12.840 --> 12:18.600
Now one more example here is that in some cultures it is acceptable and appropriate to

12:18.600 --> 12:24.160
interject a short word at the end of sentences of speakers during expositions.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.720
So this indicates that you're listening, you're paying attention.

12:27.720 --> 12:33.520
Now in English you can see this when people say yes at the end of somebody's sentence

12:33.520 --> 12:35.960
all the time.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.760
The BBC television show Antiques Roadshow has examples of this all the time.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.320
This is a very valuable, yes, yes, they had known that at the beginning.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.640
Let's keep the conversation going.

12:47.640 --> 12:57.920
However in other cultures that's considered very rude to interrupt your speaker.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.480
My example three.

13:00.480 --> 13:05.960
There are words and phrases that are unacceptable in certain cultures.

13:05.960 --> 13:10.960
There are symbols and phrases that were I to use them here would probably get me reported

13:10.960 --> 13:16.800
for a violation of the code of conduct and derail this entire conversation.

13:16.800 --> 13:22.440
Yet those words and phrases are acceptable in other cultural settings.

13:22.440 --> 13:28.320
So what cultural relativism teaches us is that when in a multicultural setting if one

13:28.320 --> 13:40.040
is confused or triggered by a symbol, gesture or phrase one should ask what it means.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.200
So Melville Herskovitz.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.600
Judgments are based on experience and experience is interpreted by an individual in terms of

13:47.600 --> 13:48.920
their culture.

13:48.920 --> 13:56.920
As I said Melville Herskovitz was a student of Franz Boas and my parents' instructor.

13:56.920 --> 14:03.600
So let's look at a couple of examples of cultural relativism in cross-cultural teams.

14:03.600 --> 14:11.600
I worked on a project where we were transitioning the development from one culture to another.

14:11.600 --> 14:16.360
One team to another really were separate cultures.

14:16.360 --> 14:21.360
In the one receiving culture it was not permissible to show failure.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.560
This was a career limiting move.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.880
Don't fail, don't show failure.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.240
It was also not acceptable to disagree with somebody who is perceived to be of a higher

14:31.240 --> 14:34.640
rank or status.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.440
And we're trying to do open source development where everybody does everything in the public

14:38.440 --> 14:41.640
so that you can see what's happening.

14:41.640 --> 14:46.200
So this was a problem for us as we're trying to move this across.

14:46.200 --> 14:52.280
And so we came up with a couple of techniques that we used in this project to get around

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
this problem.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.600
One was actually understanding what the problem was.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.200
You know it's like well I don't want to check that into the source code control system.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.240
I don't want to do this, I won't do that.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.240
Why?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
Because we just don't do that.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.920
And then you have to work a little bit.

15:05.920 --> 15:13.160
You find out what the problems are at the base and figure out how you can work a solution.

15:13.160 --> 15:17.680
So what we did was we made it safe to fail and we exhibited failures on the original

15:17.680 --> 15:18.680
team.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.880
And one of the things we did was our source code control system you would check stuff

15:21.880 --> 15:26.600
in any branch and it would build the branch and most of the time that's going to fail

15:26.600 --> 15:29.960
if you're working on a development branch.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.880
So we exhibited that.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.680
We showed that look this happens all the time.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.440
All of the developers that have been working on this team this always happens.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.840
Don't worry about it.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.000
Nobody's going to look at your failures unless you ask them to.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.760
I mean if you want somebody to come in and say I can't understand why this is failing

15:44.760 --> 15:45.760
can you help me out?

15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
They're going to come look.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.040
But otherwise they're going to ignore that.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
Don't worry about it.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
It's safe.

15:51.040 --> 15:58.240
We were we pointed out that developers were not allowed to change the main branch of code.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.040
You know couldn't check stuff indirectly to it.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.600
There really wasn't a way to break that.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.800
There were there were permission controls in place that were going to prohibit that.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.760
And in fact if you were able to do that as a new developer come in and put something

16:11.760 --> 16:15.880
in the main branch of code then you had just found a bug in the permission system and you

16:15.880 --> 16:17.880
should be congratulated.

16:17.880 --> 16:23.480
We showed that all developers were following the same process.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.280
There weren't senior developers doing something different had more you know more ability to

16:27.280 --> 16:32.400
do stuff that junior were developing code and they did have permission to do stuff that

16:32.400 --> 16:36.800
was different but development of code development of what the project was always the same for

16:36.800 --> 16:40.720
everybody.

16:40.720 --> 16:45.040
We also said that no code would be reviewed unless it was in the version control system.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.400
So this gave us the advantage.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
We're a distributed team.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.040
We've got to be able to look at the code and know that we're talking about the same code

16:50.040 --> 16:55.200
the same lines all those great things that people we know about.

16:55.200 --> 17:01.200
And as a secondary effect of this it meant that when desktops and laptops crashed we

17:01.200 --> 17:03.000
had the code in the conversion control system.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.280
So a great benefit there.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.200
You know nothing really out of the ordinary.

17:09.200 --> 17:14.000
We also made it safe to disagree.

17:14.000 --> 17:27.880
And doing this was probably an anathema to some agile purgurists here because we made

17:27.880 --> 17:34.080
it so that in the stand up we would have discussion and dissent.

17:34.080 --> 17:38.680
And so you know normally your agile thing is what am I doing today what I did yesterday

17:38.680 --> 17:41.560
what's blocking me done.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.680
Now we're going to have discussion and dissent.

17:44.680 --> 17:50.160
And what this did was it meant that the new members were able to see how within the team

17:50.160 --> 17:54.920
we would discuss these issues and we would bring these problems up and talk about them

17:54.920 --> 17:57.680
and that this was okay it was acceptable.

17:57.680 --> 18:03.240
And over time they began to open up and to disagree and to present their perspectives

18:03.240 --> 18:06.720
on things and ask questions.

18:06.720 --> 18:13.800
And it really became very strong contributors to the project.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.600
And the other piece here is ask the questions.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.920
And this is in delicate questions.

18:19.920 --> 18:25.800
Need to be acceptable to ask in delicate questions.

18:25.800 --> 18:30.560
And this is because if I don't understand what you've said and I'm trying to understand

18:30.560 --> 18:41.720
that at some point I'm going to ask a question that to you is going to be rude not acceptable

18:41.720 --> 18:45.840
and it needs to be okay for that to happen because we can't figure out where that point

18:45.840 --> 18:49.360
is and what that issue is if we can't talk about it.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.200
So you've got to be able to both ask the in delicate question and you've got to be ready

18:53.200 --> 18:56.480
to receive the in delicate question.

18:56.480 --> 19:04.960
Okay, so the net result here was we established a project culture.

19:04.960 --> 19:09.440
And the project culture wasn't this is our culture and it's great it's better come do

19:09.440 --> 19:10.920
what we do.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.560
It was this is the culture of the project and let's make this work and let's all contribute

19:15.560 --> 19:19.320
to it and we can change the culture and do all of the things that we do but make the

19:19.320 --> 19:23.120
culture of the project and live by that.

19:23.120 --> 19:32.120
So the second example this all occurred in Western culture and then the conversation

19:32.120 --> 19:37.000
occurred on Slack and basically there was a conference coming up and I said what time

19:37.000 --> 19:42.800
do the doors open I want to know what time do we start and close at the end of the day.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.480
And I was told oh you go to this website and you'll see the times.

19:46.480 --> 19:54.120
I went and I said that can't get there if unless I'm registered if you're not registered

19:54.120 --> 19:56.240
why do you care.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.320
And so my co workers came to me said well that was rather rude.

20:00.320 --> 20:03.400
And I thought well all right.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.400
Yeah, I can see that as it could be rude.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.280
But I had worked with these guys for a lot for a number of years.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.440
They're planning a conference that under a lot of stress because we're getting close

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
to the time.

20:15.440 --> 20:21.000
They're trying to get through all the questions in the day to see you know you coming in you

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
get through the whole questions get those answers out the door get to the next process.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.160
Let's see if we get this project done and get this conference running.

20:29.160 --> 20:36.800
So the people I've known for a long time and to me it would just take too long to say I

20:36.800 --> 20:40.840
don't see why anyone attended not attending the conference would be interested in starting

20:40.840 --> 20:41.840
times.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.480
Can you elaborate on why you want to know.

20:43.480 --> 20:49.080
Yes that would be a much politer way to say that.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.200
But I understood that they didn't have the time.

20:52.200 --> 20:59.480
So what I want to point out here is that the written word is often difficult to understand

20:59.480 --> 21:02.680
what's meant in the in the written word.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.600
You have no vocal or facial cues.

21:05.600 --> 21:09.880
And then I want to point out that those are culturally based as well.

21:09.880 --> 21:14.400
All right so let's look at how to succeed.

21:14.400 --> 21:21.720
Define the culture of the project not just in terms of words but in actions.

21:21.720 --> 21:28.000
You want to talk about inclusivity and sensitivity and you want to do the training for that.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.400
Brilliant that's great that tells you what to do.

21:31.400 --> 21:38.080
But it's the practice and the execution of the training that builds the culture.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.800
Practice makes the culture.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.000
You need to consider cultural differences when we're talking about discussions.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.960
We have discussions about things.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.600
If you're talking about planning documents you're trying to do planning for your project.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.360
You talk about use case definitions.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.880
You talk about documentation.

21:54.880 --> 22:03.880
Any of those things are rife fine fields for finding cultural conflicts.

22:03.880 --> 22:09.400
Make it safe to disagree and to ask questions.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.960
Make it psychologically safe to fail.

22:12.960 --> 22:21.160
And the disagreements will surface the misunderstandings before they become before the misunderstandings

22:21.160 --> 22:33.720
or the the the failure is a result of a misunderstanding that didn't rise to the level of a disagreement.

22:33.720 --> 22:43.920
So somebody you make it safe to disagree and it didn't come up and then you get a failure because there was a misunderstanding that wasn't a disagreement.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.440
So you want to explore both of those in any case.

22:46.440 --> 22:53.400
You want to explore them both as possible friction point between cultures.

22:53.400 --> 23:03.440
So when you see either of those in your project as you're working your teams think about is there a cultural difference that might be contributing here.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.120
So exhibit the culture of the project.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.920
Again practice builds culture.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.560
I can't stress that enough.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.520
Management has to lead by example.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.880
I like to say no executive washrooms and do everything in public.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.200
Failure must be public.

23:21.200 --> 23:29.160
By public I mean obviously if you're working in a corporate environment that's going to be within the firewall of the project.

23:29.160 --> 23:38.320
Management work items with the exception of personnel and other legally encumbered topics must be in the public within the project.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.400
What is management doing.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.160
What is our goal.

23:40.160 --> 23:46.120
I mean that that's really going to help facilitate the communication up and down.

23:46.120 --> 23:53.280
Treat everyone every objection every suggestion every point of view with respect.

23:53.280 --> 23:57.840
Assume that everyone working on the project is working towards success.

23:57.840 --> 24:04.400
And never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or cultural difference.

24:04.400 --> 24:11.640
So in closing when we're connected to others we become better people.

24:11.640 --> 24:17.520
And the art of cross cultural team management is to be a better person.

24:17.520 --> 24:25.640
So if I've offended anyone with any image or phrase during this talk please accept my apology.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.720
And understand that it was unintentional.

24:28.720 --> 24:33.720
But also let me know so that I can adjust my approach in the future.

24:33.720 --> 24:42.720
Thank you.

24:42.720 --> 24:43.880
That was lovely.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.640
Very much appreciated.

24:45.640 --> 24:49.240
If you are open to taking questions we certainly have some time for questions.

24:49.240 --> 24:49.840
Oh dear.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.720
OK.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.320
Would anyone like to ask a question of our speaker.

24:54.320 --> 24:54.720
Excellent.

24:54.720 --> 24:58.400
I'm headed your way.

24:58.400 --> 25:08.320
I should have spoken slower.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.200
Thank you for a wonderful talk.

25:11.200 --> 25:16.280
I wanted to ask you if you were in a position where you were leading a project or a team

25:16.280 --> 25:21.160
that is very multicultural and those things also keep changing.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.200
You get new people.

25:22.200 --> 25:27.440
Some people leave and it's just a great diversity in the team.

25:27.440 --> 25:33.480
How would you approach learning more about their cultures and what is and isn't acceptable

25:33.480 --> 25:40.680
and then trying to find a mesh that works for everyone.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.000
OK.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.640
So the question is if you're having multicultural team where people are coming and going lots

25:45.640 --> 25:49.480
of cultural change from the people that are in the team.

25:49.480 --> 25:55.480
How do you find a way to understand what everybody's culture is and what's acceptable

25:55.480 --> 25:59.360
for everybody.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.800
I think to answer the second part I'm not sure that you can find something that's acceptable

26:02.800 --> 26:04.080
to everybody.

26:04.080 --> 26:12.480
That there's always going to be somebody who's a little tweaked I suppose by things

26:12.480 --> 26:13.280
that go on.

26:13.280 --> 26:19.520
But it is being open to realizing that the problem is there is the first part.

26:19.520 --> 26:23.360
And then asking questions.

26:23.360 --> 26:27.840
And basically I think if you want to talk about documentation or something like that

26:27.840 --> 26:33.520
then it would be documenting how you are open to these, how these questions can be asked

26:33.520 --> 26:37.280
and what makes this a safe space to ask these questions.

26:37.280 --> 26:42.680
I don't know that there is a generic answer that says this is how you do it and it works

26:42.680 --> 26:44.560
across everything.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.960
Because there are just so many differences.

26:46.960 --> 26:51.720
I have lots of great horror stories if somebody wants to come ask.

26:51.720 --> 27:10.840
But then they're all different and they all have different solutions.

27:10.840 --> 27:15.320
So you talked about the challenges that you saw in your projects where people think in

27:15.320 --> 27:21.440
a very hierarchical way and don't want to engage or interact with someone that they

27:21.440 --> 27:24.080
perceive as higher ranked.

27:24.080 --> 27:28.320
And also people wanting to do everything in a perfect manner.

27:28.320 --> 27:36.120
And your resolution to that was to flatten the structure, enable communication and everyone

27:36.120 --> 27:37.120
can fail.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.600
Which is a very western way of thinking.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
It is.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.200
And if you try to bring them across to your culture, have you ever tried to do it the

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
other way?

27:45.200 --> 27:51.080
Try to engage in a project or let the project go in a more hierarchical way and make sure

27:51.080 --> 27:56.360
that people were rewarded on not making errors?

27:56.360 --> 27:59.560
And if so, what were your experiences?

27:59.560 --> 28:03.600
That's a really good question.

28:03.600 --> 28:07.720
And yes it was, it ended up being a very western way of looking at it.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
I recognize that.

28:09.720 --> 28:17.240
I will say in defense of this one project is that we were moving from the western framework

28:17.240 --> 28:21.240
where we were working and the project was working and everybody was sort of depending

28:21.240 --> 28:23.760
on the project working.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.160
All of our users were sort of dependent on the way the project had worked.

28:27.160 --> 28:34.040
So there was a lot of pressure to sort of stay the same course.

28:34.040 --> 28:39.600
Have I worked in other, if I think about it I can probably come up with one.

28:39.600 --> 28:45.360
But no, it's probably the most honest answer.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.480
I haven't had a, I have worked in very hierarchical structures.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.760
That's the US corporate structure works that way.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.880
And that's why I'm an open source.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.280
That's a matter I can say.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.280
Without getting myself in serious trouble.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.280
Hey Claude.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.280
Hey Flora.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.280
Fancy seeing you here.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.240
So you work for Ivan which is originated in Finland.

29:10.240 --> 29:15.720
Is there any fun story that you can share from the very Finnish culture that Ivan has?

29:15.720 --> 29:16.720
No.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.720
Well done sir.

29:17.720 --> 29:20.720
I saw a hand over here.

29:20.720 --> 29:26.720
I can get your hand over here.

29:26.720 --> 29:32.280
I would say, and it's not an exact answer but in kind of reference to the previous thing.

29:32.280 --> 29:37.280
So in some cultures like at the meeting you never actually discuss the thing.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.160
All the conversations happen in one to one conversation around the meeting.

29:40.160 --> 29:44.320
And you show up at the meeting and the leader says we should do this and everyone says yes.

29:44.320 --> 29:48.240
But the meeting doesn't happen until consensus is already gained.

29:48.240 --> 29:55.680
And that's actually, when there's a very controversial decision I found that to be like

29:55.680 --> 29:57.000
actually a useful technique.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.520
Like I know that if we just have meetings straight up, like we're going to have a huge

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
argument.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.720
So I go and talk to each of the people individually.

30:03.720 --> 30:09.960
I try and sort of canvas a solution so that then when we actually have the meeting everyone

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
has already agreed.

30:10.960 --> 30:16.600
So that's at least one situation where we can learn from other kinds of cultures and

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
import that.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Yes.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Yeah I would agree.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.120
Makes for very short meetings.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.120
I love that.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.280
Alright folks we're going to go ahead and begin to transition to the next speaker.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.280
Thank you again Claude.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.280
Very much appreciate it.

30:29.280 --> 30:33.560
Give it up for Claude Col sentenced.
