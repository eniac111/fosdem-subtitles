WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.520
We don't yet have the text. So there was a call for input and people have responded to

00:20.520 --> 00:24.400
this so we did have some chance to give input to the Commission already but that was at

00:24.400 --> 00:29.560
the stage where we didn't see what is actually being proposed. We still have not seen it.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.480
It will be published in April of this year but at this stage we are already planning

00:34.480 --> 00:37.240
because we know this is going to be a big topic. So what you're going to see right now

00:37.240 --> 00:42.680
is the early stage planning of what a campaign that could help free software deal with software

00:42.680 --> 00:46.520
patents could look like in the coming months. And to start it's going to be my colleague

00:46.520 --> 00:54.160
here Panos from N Software Patents. Yeah so hi everyone I am Panos Algropoulos. I have

00:54.160 --> 01:00.640
been working on the N Software Patents campaign for a while for about two years approximately.

01:00.640 --> 01:06.160
Just to give an overview of the presentation today I am going to talk about in general

01:06.160 --> 01:13.440
what's the deal with SAPs and FRAND and a rough overview of case law and then Kiaran

01:13.440 --> 01:18.720
will present the free software's toughest problem and five fixes we can think about

01:18.720 --> 01:28.640
it. So what's the deal with SAPs and FRAND? Two words that are probably unknown to many.

01:28.640 --> 01:35.840
SAP stands for Standard Essential Patent and FRAND stands for Fair, Reasonable and

01:35.840 --> 01:45.720
Non-Discriminatory. Just to illustrate what's going on here. As we all know that in technology

01:45.720 --> 01:54.080
standards are very important so if we want devices to work with each other and we want

01:54.080 --> 02:04.320
them to be incompatible we need to use a standard right. So these standards are usually the

02:04.320 --> 02:09.780
rules for these standards are going to be set up by standard setting organizations.

02:09.780 --> 02:17.800
So what happens is that for a known standard there are usually patents that are very important

02:17.800 --> 02:26.360
for the standard to work. So those standards are called standard essential patents and

02:26.360 --> 02:33.240
if one wants to participate in the standard they need to use the patent so that person

02:33.240 --> 02:40.560
is called implementer and they have to get a license from the SAP holder. Now of course

02:40.560 --> 02:47.880
as we all know a patent is very restrictive to everyone so here's what standard setting

02:47.880 --> 02:54.960
organizations do. They require from the SAP holders to license their patents their SAPs

02:54.960 --> 03:05.960
under FRAND licenses. Now it sounds great but there are issues. As we said FRAND stands

03:05.960 --> 03:14.800
for Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory but that's a very very very vague term. First

03:14.800 --> 03:21.360
of all it can affect everyone that's working with standards and that includes network protocols,

03:21.360 --> 03:29.560
Internet of Things, audio video codecs, the automotive industry and so on and on. The

03:29.560 --> 03:40.240
problem is that when the implementers have to use the patents they have to come under

03:40.240 --> 03:49.480
agreements with the SAP holders and the SAP holders they try to charge as much money as

03:49.480 --> 03:57.920
possible and most likely the implementers are not very satisfied with that. So the real

03:57.920 --> 04:03.000
problem is that there's a potential abuse of dominant power, of dominant position by

04:03.000 --> 04:08.560
the SAP holders and the high transaction costs for implementers are simply unsustainable

04:08.560 --> 04:18.440
for SMEs, for small and medium enterprises. And that in general adds up to the legal uncertainty

04:18.440 --> 04:31.760
regarding software patents. So to be more specific on the way this has been reflected

04:31.760 --> 04:36.400
in the courts because what happens is that when you have an implementer and they come

04:36.400 --> 04:44.200
into a disagreement with a patent holder what happens is that litigation happens. So they

04:44.200 --> 04:52.760
go to the courts and what do the courts say? Well they should try to help as much as possible.

04:52.760 --> 05:00.080
I have a layout here of the courts, of the court decisions that have been relevant and

05:00.080 --> 05:05.240
have been basically the landmark decisions in Europe. First of all it all started with

05:05.240 --> 05:12.760
the German Federal Supreme Court and it started with a very strict and conservative stance

05:12.760 --> 05:22.200
very pro-ACP holder stance because it basically had a very strict test for a front defence

05:22.200 --> 05:29.800
and the front defence is basically when the implementer says yes you are the SAP holder

05:29.800 --> 05:35.960
but the money that you charge for that are way too high for me to actually participate

05:35.960 --> 05:43.320
in the market and that is an abuse of your dominant position. And the German Federal

05:43.320 --> 05:53.280
Supreme Court was more in favour of the patent holders and that was in 2009. But then what

05:53.280 --> 06:01.080
happened is that we had a very important decision from the European Court of Justice that concerned

06:01.080 --> 06:08.600
competition law and it took a more balanced approach. And then in 2020 there was another

06:08.600 --> 06:18.120
decision, actually there was no decision, there was a German lower court which asked

06:18.120 --> 06:25.720
for more clarifications from the European Court of Justice and unfortunately for everyone

06:25.720 --> 06:34.280
the decision was, there was no decision, it was settled out of court so the court had

06:34.280 --> 06:43.080
no chance to answer those questions. To be more specific on what the German Federal Supreme

06:43.080 --> 06:53.640
Court said back in 2009, it had a very strict test and it said the alleged infringer can

06:53.640 --> 07:00.280
rely on a competition law defence only if it does the following two steps, only if it

07:00.280 --> 07:07.000
unconditionally offers to enter into a licence agreement with the SAP holder and more importantly

07:07.000 --> 07:13.280
if it behaves as if it were an actual licensee so that would mean that it would have to act

07:13.280 --> 07:19.920
as if there is already a licence and pay royalties and it was up to the defendant to prove that

07:19.920 --> 07:31.120
the conditions above are fulfilled. What happened though is that in 2014 there were two important

07:31.120 --> 07:38.120
commission decisions about anti-trust issues with Motorola and Samsung and the European

07:38.120 --> 07:44.720
Commission stated that a patent holder abuses its domain position when having given a front

07:44.720 --> 07:51.120
commitment over an SAP to a standard setting organisation, it seeks injunction against

07:51.120 --> 07:57.200
a willing licensee and a willing licensee remains free to challenge the validity of the

07:57.200 --> 08:04.080
patent or its infringement. That was very important because the German courts didn't

08:04.080 --> 08:13.280
recognise that, they didn't expect the defendant to give up some fundamental rights like this.

08:13.280 --> 08:28.120
So in about 2015 the European Court of Justice responded to a lower German court because

08:28.120 --> 08:34.160
the German courts recognised that there is a difference between what the German Federal

08:34.160 --> 08:39.920
Supreme Court says and what the European Commission is doing. So the European Court of Justice

08:39.920 --> 08:48.720
came in and clarified what's going on and it said there is a very broad test here but

08:48.720 --> 08:55.720
it's helpful enough for national courts to expand it further. The SAP holder must alert

08:55.720 --> 09:01.480
the implementer in writing of the infringement complaint of by noting the relevant SAP and

09:01.480 --> 09:08.440
how it shall is to be infringed. The implementer must express a willingness to conclude a licensing

09:08.440 --> 09:15.840
agreement on front terms. The SAP holder must provide a specific written offer for a licence

09:15.840 --> 09:21.720
on front terms. The implementer must diligently respond to that offer in accordance with recognised

09:21.720 --> 09:26.840
commercial practices and in good faith. And if the implementer does not accept the offer

09:26.840 --> 09:32.880
made to it, a counter offer that corresponds to front terms should be made. So based on

09:32.880 --> 09:40.280
that language you can probably figure out that the courts didn't really solve any problems.

09:40.280 --> 09:49.280
What they basically helped is to help the companies negotiate better on what front really

09:49.280 --> 09:58.720
is. And you might suggest from the name of the campaign and so forth the patents what

09:58.720 --> 10:05.160
we're trying to do. But it's important to follow decisions like this because it's important

10:05.160 --> 10:17.640
to understand how patents work and how front can actually affect standards. And finally

10:17.640 --> 10:23.280
just for good information there are more cases that should be studied but we don't have the

10:23.280 --> 10:29.520
time to represent them here. It's the United Kingdom Supreme Court Unwired, Planet versus

10:29.520 --> 10:37.560
Broadway in 2020 that concerns the UK. And there are two more decisions from the German

10:37.560 --> 10:46.200
Federal Supreme Court in 2020 that are also of great importance. So with that I conclude

10:46.200 --> 11:03.240
my presentation and I give the floor to Kia.

11:03.240 --> 11:08.880
So the first time I came to Brussels was in 2002 and it was to come to Fostem. And at

11:08.880 --> 11:12.960
that time Richard Stallman gave the keynote address in the Johnson Theatre and it inspired

11:12.960 --> 11:18.160
me to work on free software policy topics as a priority. So a few months later then

11:18.160 --> 11:24.720
I got interested in software patents in particular. A lot of people looked at the topic and saw

11:24.720 --> 11:28.440
it was a bit daunting and after years people said to me you've been working on this for

11:28.440 --> 11:32.120
ten years and there's no progress, how do you keep your motivation? And then they said

11:32.120 --> 11:36.400
after fifteen years how do you keep your motivation? And finally I stuck with it and now I can make

11:36.400 --> 11:40.640
the joke that after twenty years all of the software patents that I was worried about

11:40.640 --> 11:51.360
have now become invalid. But of course there are now a new generation of software patents.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.880
When I said I was giving this talk I was asked, oh can you talk about the unified patent court?

11:55.880 --> 12:01.240
No I can't. Very important but there's no time sorry. Can you talk about software patents

12:01.240 --> 12:07.680
coming into India via the AI law? No I'm sorry I can't. Can you talk about the idea of AI

12:07.680 --> 12:12.080
writing software patents? Because I think patent applications are such nonsense I think

12:12.080 --> 12:20.320
AI is the perfect thing to write the next generation of them. But no I can't. Can you

12:20.320 --> 12:23.800
talk about the cyber resilience act? We all should be, this is going to be massive but

12:23.800 --> 12:29.200
no it's got nothing to do with patents. So audio video patents are the worst case scenario

12:29.200 --> 12:35.680
for software because you have to form a standard first off. You then have to convince all of

12:35.680 --> 12:38.720
the manufacturers of hardware that this is worth putting into their hardware because

12:38.720 --> 12:44.160
you cannot do audio video with just software. Audio video software used to be optimised

12:44.160 --> 12:47.720
for decoding because encoding would happen on some mainframe somewhere and you'd download

12:47.720 --> 12:51.680
the video and you'd watch it. But now with video chat you have to do real time encoding,

12:51.680 --> 12:55.160
transmission so you need a small file size and then decoding and it should be almost

12:55.160 --> 13:00.640
real time. You convince these hardware manufacturers to put it onto their hardware and then you

13:00.640 --> 13:04.800
have to wait five years because then you have to wait for everyone, a whole world of computer

13:04.800 --> 13:08.280
users to throw out their current hardware and buy a new generation of hardware. So after

13:08.280 --> 13:12.400
five years finally the standard will be hardware accelerated on everyone's computer and then

13:12.400 --> 13:17.400
you can really use it. If at that point somebody comes along with a patent and says actually

13:17.400 --> 13:21.640
I own a bit of that software, there is very little you can do. You can no longer innovate

13:21.640 --> 13:27.680
around the problem. So software patents on standards are the worst type of patents for

13:27.680 --> 13:33.800
software and on video patent standards they are the worst of the worst. This is happening

13:33.800 --> 13:38.520
already. We have an audio format Opus which is not very famous however it is successor

13:38.520 --> 13:43.520
to the AUG audio format. It is used in a lot of hardware devices. There is currently a

13:43.520 --> 13:49.640
patent pool being formed to threaten the Opus audio format. We have the AV1 video format

13:49.640 --> 13:55.600
which is being developed to be freely implementable and already there has been a request sent

13:55.600 --> 13:59.320
to the European Commission to investigate the people working on this for anti-competitive

13:59.320 --> 14:04.520
practices because trying to help each other avoid patent problems might be a bad thing

14:04.520 --> 14:12.640
for some companies. Before I get into it I saw yesterday there was published a paper

14:12.640 --> 14:17.760
by Andrew Katz and four other researchers. I didn't get their names but it is on the

14:17.760 --> 14:22.240
implementing the HEVC standard in software so I expect that is very interesting but I

14:22.240 --> 14:27.480
will not be talking about it. There are a lot of topics here. So there was a commission

14:27.480 --> 14:32.360
call for input last year. There were responses from Open Forum Europe who I currently work

14:32.360 --> 14:39.800
for and from Open Source Initiative. However these comments were sent based on not actually

14:39.800 --> 14:44.120
knowing what text is going to be presented. So they were kind of general comments on what

14:44.120 --> 14:50.160
patent policy could be like. We still haven't seen the text that is going to be presented

14:50.160 --> 14:54.400
by the European Commission but as I said this is early stage planning for a campaign. We

14:54.400 --> 14:58.680
have to start thinking about what possibilities we have to fix this. What different form can

14:58.680 --> 15:02.520
it take? Because when we are talking about policy makers the way it works is you have

15:02.520 --> 15:07.840
to give them a list of different fixes that you are looking for and then they will say

15:07.840 --> 15:12.360
which ones are politically possible and then you have to start trying to maximise each

15:12.360 --> 15:17.360
of the ones that are politically possible. So I have found five starting ideas but this

15:17.360 --> 15:22.520
is a discussion document basically. We can discuss them further in the coming weeks.

15:22.520 --> 15:27.280
The first idea would be a carve out specific to free software. A few years ago this might

15:27.280 --> 15:31.800
have sounded a bit overly optimistic but now in the Cyber Resilience Act and the Product

15:31.800 --> 15:36.720
Liability Directive there is this text and when we first saw it we were amazed to see

15:36.720 --> 15:42.920
free and open source software should not be covered. Excellent. Of course once you start

15:42.920 --> 15:47.240
reading it then you realise well there is an objective limitation here. You can use

15:47.240 --> 15:53.040
this exemption if you are trying to do innovation or research. There is a commercial activity

15:53.040 --> 15:56.360
limitation and we all know that commercial activity has never been defined and is an

15:56.360 --> 16:01.680
endless source of clarity for what exactly that means for software and online activities

16:01.680 --> 16:07.280
and it should be exempted. So a judge will have to interpret whether or not you are allowed

16:07.280 --> 16:11.640
to use this exemption which basically means that nobody can confidently make use of this

16:11.640 --> 16:16.160
exemption so it is not very useful. However the fact that this is in a document from the

16:16.160 --> 16:20.840
Commission in two proposals for regulations tells us that inside the Commission something

16:20.840 --> 16:27.080
along these lines is acceptable. They didn't get the wording quite right at this time but

16:27.080 --> 16:31.480
they are not completely opposed to this kind of thing. So this is a starting point maybe

16:31.480 --> 16:38.720
we can do something along these lines. The second possibility would be a similar end

16:38.720 --> 16:43.320
result but from a different starting point and would be to try and carve industry into

16:43.320 --> 16:48.880
two sections. For example we might find that small and medium business in the manufacturing

16:48.880 --> 16:53.440
and pharmaceutical areas might be perfectly happy with having more patents and might want

16:53.440 --> 16:57.160
help from the Commission to apply for patents and use their patents. We happen to not like

16:57.160 --> 17:03.680
that so maybe we should have a different regime for them and one for us. There is already

17:03.680 --> 17:07.720
as part of this patent package there is a regulation that is specific to pharmaceutical

17:07.720 --> 17:13.600
patents so the Commission is not opposed to singling out sector by sector. Our argument

17:13.600 --> 17:19.480
can be that our sector is different because we have collaborative models and we have market

17:19.480 --> 17:24.440
solutions. If you look at the patent clauses of the GPL and the Apache 2.0 license we already

17:24.440 --> 17:28.920
have market solutions so maybe we can tell the European Commission don't interfere with

17:28.920 --> 17:37.680
what we are already fixing. A third fix and this is still quite early stage is the idea

17:37.680 --> 17:43.000
of competition law. I have always believed that there is not enough discussion of how

17:43.000 --> 17:47.960
competition law is weakened by the existence of patents. The European Commission loves

17:47.960 --> 17:51.760
to work on patent law and it is a big topic in the European Commission but it just seems

17:51.760 --> 17:56.520
that there is not enough dialogue between people who are enforcing competition law and

17:56.520 --> 18:02.160
people who are working on patent policy. So I think maybe if we could find a way to make

18:02.160 --> 18:07.440
it clearer to the European Commission and European institutions in general that how

18:07.440 --> 18:11.880
these two topics interact maybe we could help make them understand what we are trying to

18:11.880 --> 18:18.200
achieve. The fourth one, there are only five, I am not going to go on all night, the fourth

18:18.200 --> 18:22.240
one is something that we will definitely be discussed because the Commission has mentioned

18:22.240 --> 18:28.640
this in their documents. So Fran, at times we think the idea of non-discriminatory that

18:28.640 --> 18:33.800
must help us because we don't want regimes that discriminate against free software. We

18:33.800 --> 18:40.600
need patent regimes that allow for royalty free use of patents. However, non-discriminatory

18:40.600 --> 18:45.000
currently the standard meaning for this is that you don't discriminate between individuals.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.520
If you have a certain system for working out how much royalties you are going to ask for

18:48.520 --> 18:55.080
you have to apply the same system to each potential licensee. However, maybe we can

18:55.080 --> 18:59.720
expand this, maybe we can work with this term and find a way to talk about non-discriminatory

18:59.720 --> 19:06.280
so that it is not just, so that it prevents the patent regime from discriminating against

19:06.280 --> 19:11.160
free software which cannot pay royalty fees because we cannot count the copies. If that

19:11.160 --> 19:15.720
doesn't work then of course the word fair, it's an even more vague word but maybe we

19:15.720 --> 19:22.800
can do something with this word to just talk about how fair should apply to free software.

19:22.800 --> 19:29.680
There is also as part of this package there is a regulation coming on compulsory licensing

19:29.680 --> 19:33.960
so maybe that angle can also be used there to ask for something that works with free

19:33.960 --> 19:39.440
software so that would have to be a royalty free sub-licensible patent licence with no

19:39.440 --> 19:51.360
domain limit. And the last fix being presented for the first time. So the whole problem with

19:51.360 --> 19:54.680
software patents in Europe has always been that we have a patent law that says software

19:54.680 --> 19:59.680
is not patentable as such and the policy makers, when we complained we don't want software

19:59.680 --> 20:04.440
patents, they said but it's not patentable, look software is not patentable as such. The

20:04.440 --> 20:09.480
problem was that of course the patent applications were always written as patent on a limited

20:09.480 --> 20:13.480
resource device which interacts with this and there is always a way to make software

20:13.480 --> 20:19.760
sound like it's more than just software as such. What if we asked them to give an example?

20:19.760 --> 20:29.320
What if we asked them to put this into a patent law on standard essential patents? Software

20:29.320 --> 20:33.600
which reads, transmits or puts data into a data format standard is an example of software

20:33.600 --> 20:42.760
as such. If we could do this, and this is a crazy idea, maybe we could find a way to

20:42.760 --> 20:48.920
get software as such to be defined in a concrete way and we could actually start using the

20:48.920 --> 20:55.720
idea that software as such is not patentable. Now, when we used to campaign against software

20:55.720 --> 20:59.920
patents, the commission, because this software is not patentable as such language is there,

20:59.920 --> 21:03.160
they said don't worry, there's not going to be American style software patents, it's not

21:03.160 --> 21:08.120
going to happen. I would like to try and find out the documents they used to use and I want

21:08.120 --> 21:12.480
to find any statements, anything that they ever said that explained what their motivation

21:12.480 --> 21:18.880
was, if they were saying that their intention was that data formats for example or compatibility

21:18.880 --> 21:23.560
interoperability, which is a massive buzzword now in the European institutions, if these

21:23.560 --> 21:28.640
things were not meant to be hampered by software patents, then maybe we can say, well, please

21:28.640 --> 21:35.560
clarify this. Your regulation says you want to reduce the unclarity, give us some clarity

21:35.560 --> 21:41.520
on what exactly software as such is and maybe we can put this into law. Those are my five

21:41.520 --> 21:46.040
fixes. I don't have a favourite one, we don't know which one is going to be acceptable,

21:46.040 --> 21:50.880
we don't know what text even we have to insert any of these into, but this is something that

21:50.880 --> 21:57.160
we will be continuing to hold a dialogue on in the coming weeks and months and I hope

21:57.160 --> 22:03.120
this topic gets lots of attention and lots of you get involved. With that, we do have

22:03.120 --> 22:08.320
a tool for coordinating work on this and Panos will brief you.

22:08.320 --> 22:18.880
I have a microphone. You probably guessed it from the whole presentation. There's so

22:18.880 --> 22:25.240
much information to be digested and it's extremely difficult to talk about all of this in 25

22:25.240 --> 22:32.200
minutes, but what we are trying to do with our websites and software patents is to have

22:32.200 --> 22:39.280
the central resource for everything for software patents. That includes case law, legislation

22:39.280 --> 22:44.320
and that includes the whole world. We want to make people not forget software patents

22:44.320 --> 22:53.480
like they forgot them probably the last 15 years and we try to make everything about

22:53.480 --> 23:00.280
software patents, let's make them the headlines, let's make software patents something that

23:00.280 --> 23:05.120
everyone should be concerned and not make the copyright the only issue that concerns

23:05.120 --> 23:15.080
free software because patents actually concern not only free software but software in general.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.080
With that, we would like to thank you for your attention.

23:19.080 --> 23:30.360
Please try to contribute to these resources. It's extremely valuable.

23:30.360 --> 23:34.720
We have time for one question and this is going to Simon.

23:34.720 --> 23:44.000
Thank you very much. I'll try and frame this in the form of a question if I can. One thing

23:44.000 --> 23:49.040
I'd like to point out about all of your comments about Fran is that all of those lawsuits that

23:49.040 --> 23:56.880
you displayed included Etsy as a co-respondent because the Fran expectation is not a part

23:56.880 --> 24:02.520
of law, it's a part of the way the specification of the standard is written. As a consequence,

24:02.520 --> 24:08.920
anything based on Fran commitments is on very shifty ground because there's no real proof

24:08.920 --> 24:14.200
that anybody is actually forced to do things on Fran terms anyway. I don't like number

24:14.200 --> 24:23.200
four. Number two, your carve out, I've written a paper on that for OFE and I think that's

24:23.200 --> 24:30.360
the one to go for because there is actually a division between standards that are done

24:30.360 --> 24:34.440
that are implementation based and ones that are requirements based where monetisation

24:34.440 --> 24:40.160
depends on patents. You can find a compromise that will work there and I'd like to invite

24:40.160 --> 24:46.040
you to come with me to an Etsy meeting and meet the people who think we are all crazy,

24:46.040 --> 24:51.680
batshit crazy idiots who want to destroy the European economy because that's what they

24:51.680 --> 24:56.840
say to me when I say anything you just said. We're not going to get anywhere with the commission

24:56.840 --> 25:00.640
unless we understand their position and appear to accommodate it even if we think they're

25:00.640 --> 25:06.700
the ones that are crazy. Then that implementation paper from Andrew Katz you saw, the important

25:06.700 --> 25:11.680
thing to know about it is it says it's impossible for an open source implementation to get any

25:11.680 --> 25:16.640
licenses to any patents in any standards because they went and tried for the standard that's

25:16.640 --> 25:22.180
mentioned in the title. That paper isn't a general paper about the topic. They went and

25:22.180 --> 25:26.480
tried to go and get Fran licenses and they found it was impossible for them to go and

25:26.480 --> 25:32.240
secure Fran licenses to any of those standards. This whole thing is based on a false premise

25:32.240 --> 25:38.200
that anyone is going to actually fairly get licenses. This is all about entrapping implementers

25:38.200 --> 25:44.280
into the universe of the companies that have rigged the standards at the regulatory captured

25:44.280 --> 25:45.680
standards organisations.

25:45.680 --> 25:54.560
Okay, cool. So let's move to Kota Zugel.

25:54.560 --> 26:00.240
The term Fran is in the commission's call for input. So it seems, although it is not

26:00.240 --> 26:03.840
in European law at the moment, there is a regulation from 2012 that has some reference

26:03.840 --> 26:08.160
to it, but it's not in general European law, but it's in the commission's call for input.

26:08.160 --> 26:13.840
So it may be defined and if it is going to be defined, then let's define it ourselves.

26:13.840 --> 26:14.840
Thank you.

26:14.840 --> 26:30.720
Thank you.
