1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.960
All right, everybody, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah-Jane Whitfield.

2
0:00:08.960 --> 0:00:11.320
Hi, everyone.

3
0:00:11.320 --> 0:00:13.880
As you know now, my name is Sarah-Jane Whitfield.

4
0:00:13.880 --> 0:00:17.360
I'm an open source advisor at Google.

5
0:00:17.360 --> 0:00:22.480
This is my very first FOSDEM, very first in-person speaking engagement, so please bear with

6
0:00:22.480 --> 0:00:23.480
me through the nerves.

7
0:00:23.480 --> 0:00:24.480
I'm the jetlash.

8
0:00:24.480 --> 0:00:25.480
Thank you.

9
0:00:25.480 --> 0:00:26.480
Thank you.

10
0:00:26.480 --> 0:00:27.480
Thank you.

11
0:00:27.480 --> 0:00:28.480
Thank you.

12
0:00:28.480 --> 0:00:34.000
Everyone I've met so far has been so nice, so gracious, so understanding.

13
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:36.920
I really, really appreciate it.

14
0:00:36.920 --> 0:00:43.320
And I'll also say that while I'm going to nerd out quite a bit on this topic that I

15
0:00:43.320 --> 0:00:49.600
find super interesting, if you came here for answers about what exactly is the unauthorized

16
0:00:49.600 --> 0:00:54.320
practice of law, I regret to inform you that you will not be leaving with answers.

17
0:00:54.320 --> 0:00:56.720
You will be leaving with lots and lots of questions.

18
0:00:56.720 --> 0:01:02.760
And I hope that that will spur some discussion and we can think through some of the very

19
0:01:02.760 --> 0:01:07.640
fuzzy lines that determine what is or isn't the practice of law.

20
0:01:07.640 --> 0:01:10.560
Let's see.

21
0:01:10.560 --> 0:01:11.560
Hopefully this works.

22
0:01:11.560 --> 0:01:18.840
All right, so in light of the subject matter that I'm covering today, I wanted to just

23
0:01:18.840 --> 0:01:21.800
clarify that this is not legal advice.

24
0:01:21.800 --> 0:01:24.400
I am not your lawyer.

25
0:01:24.400 --> 0:01:29.600
This is for general informational purposes only.

26
0:01:29.600 --> 0:01:31.600
Likewise I have a few housekeeping notes.

27
0:01:31.600 --> 0:01:38.920
So typical American, I know, mostly going to be focusing, well exclusively going to

28
0:01:38.920 --> 0:01:45.760
be focusing on US law today, mostly because that's where most of the action is with regard

29
0:01:45.760 --> 0:01:47.400
to software at this time.

30
0:01:47.400 --> 0:01:52.280
It's also what I'm most familiar with when it comes to unauthorized practice of law.

31
0:01:52.280 --> 0:01:58.240
I absolutely acknowledge that basically every other jurisdiction around the world regulates

32
0:01:58.240 --> 0:02:00.800
the practice of law.

33
0:02:00.800 --> 0:02:06.600
And based on the research that I did before this talk, it appears that most other countries

34
0:02:06.600 --> 0:02:11.880
really distinguish and emphasize regulating the practice in a courtroom setting where

35
0:02:11.880 --> 0:02:19.720
you're actually representing a client in front of a judge way more than out of law practice.

36
0:02:19.720 --> 0:02:24.680
And it's less distinguished in the US.

37
0:02:24.680 --> 0:02:30.720
Finally, wanted to let you all know in the interest of time and everything that I want

38
0:02:30.720 --> 0:02:36.960
to cover, I'm going to be giving you high level summaries of various rules and three

39
0:02:36.960 --> 0:02:40.640
cases that I'll cover.

40
0:02:40.640 --> 0:02:46.260
And as I mentioned before, I'm going to leave you with some open-ended questions to consider.

41
0:02:46.260 --> 0:02:54.640
So to get started, by show of hands, is anyone familiar with a company called Do Not Pay?

42
0:02:54.640 --> 0:02:58.400
Okay, just a few of you.

43
0:02:58.400 --> 0:03:05.080
So Do Not Pay is a US-based company that was launched in 2015 initially providing a chatbot

44
0:03:05.080 --> 0:03:12.000
service that would help users fight traffic tickets.

45
0:03:12.000 --> 0:03:17.320
They expanded their services to deal with other consumer disputes like if your flight

46
0:03:17.320 --> 0:03:23.880
was canceled and you were eligible for a refund, the chatbot would help you through that process.

47
0:03:23.880 --> 0:03:28.120
If you wanted to cancel your free trial before you got charged, it would help you through

48
0:03:28.120 --> 0:03:30.000
that process.

49
0:03:30.000 --> 0:03:35.040
In 2018, they relaunched their app to integrate AI.

50
0:03:35.040 --> 0:03:39.560
I believe that they say that they're relying on IBM Watson.

51
0:03:39.560 --> 0:03:43.600
And they dubbed it the world's first robot lawyer.

52
0:03:43.600 --> 0:03:50.000
And they included various legal actions and legal document generation as part of their

53
0:03:50.000 --> 0:03:51.920
services.

54
0:03:51.920 --> 0:04:00.120
So if any of you are maybe in the future interested in getting involved more in the legal tech

55
0:04:00.120 --> 0:04:04.440
Twitter space, you'll see things pop up like this all the time.

56
0:04:04.440 --> 0:04:08.800
So in the past month, this happened after I had submitted this talk.

57
0:04:08.800 --> 0:04:12.160
So this worked out well for me.

58
0:04:12.160 --> 0:04:20.000
Do Not Pay announced in early January that their AI was going to actually represent someone

59
0:04:20.000 --> 0:04:27.280
live in court, in traffic court, to dispute a $200 traffic ticket.

60
0:04:27.280 --> 0:04:34.640
A few days later, they offered a million dollars to anyone who was willing to leverage their

61
0:04:34.640 --> 0:04:40.760
AI exclusively in arguing case in front of the Supreme Court.

62
0:04:40.760 --> 0:04:45.760
About a week later, it announced some additional legal products that it was releasing where

63
0:04:45.760 --> 0:04:55.760
it would summarize terms of service and lease agreement terms highlighting the terms that

64
0:04:55.760 --> 0:05:01.040
were not standard so that the consumer had a better understanding and more insight into

65
0:05:01.040 --> 0:05:08.160
what they were agreeing to and whether it was standard or not market if they were being

66
0:05:08.160 --> 0:05:11.080
taken advantage of.

67
0:05:11.080 --> 0:05:21.480
And they then confirmed that their case in the traffic court was actually supposed to

68
0:05:21.480 --> 0:05:23.960
take place on February 22.

69
0:05:23.960 --> 0:05:26.000
Everything was good to go.

70
0:05:26.000 --> 0:05:31.480
Three days after that announcement, they regretted to inform all of their followers that they

71
0:05:31.480 --> 0:05:35.680
were indefinitely postponing going live in any courtroom.

72
0:05:35.680 --> 0:05:42.440
And they were also going to roll back any of the legal services that their website offered.

73
0:05:42.440 --> 0:05:44.560
So what happened exactly?

74
0:05:44.560 --> 0:05:47.200
Lawyers, lawyers happened.

75
0:05:47.200 --> 0:05:53.680
Lawyers in the regulatory bodies in the US, the state bar associations said, ah, no, I

76
0:05:53.680 --> 0:05:55.680
think that's our job.

77
0:05:55.680 --> 0:06:02.440
This looks and smells a lot like the unauthorized practice of law.

78
0:06:02.440 --> 0:06:09.120
And along those lines, penalties across the board can include civil penalties, fines.

79
0:06:09.120 --> 0:06:16.760
It could also include jail time being incarcerated for the unauthorized practice of law.

80
0:06:16.760 --> 0:06:23.760
So Do Not Pay was not interested in pursuing that and waiting to see what might happen.

81
0:06:23.760 --> 0:06:31.200
The founder said he was surprised he had underestimated how seriously lawyers in the US would take

82
0:06:31.200 --> 0:06:35.200
a $200 speeding ticket.

83
0:06:35.200 --> 0:06:40.800
So again, I said that you're likely going to leave with more questions and answers today.

84
0:06:40.800 --> 0:06:47.240
I would love to give you a clear definition for what the practice of law actually is.

85
0:06:47.240 --> 0:06:50.640
But unfortunately, there is not one unifying definition.

86
0:06:50.640 --> 0:06:53.400
Each state regulates the practice of law.

87
0:06:53.400 --> 0:06:57.680
So each state has their own definition for what the practice of law is.

88
0:06:57.680 --> 0:07:05.600
And they very much like keeping it vague instead of enumerating every possible action or type

89
0:07:05.600 --> 0:07:11.320
of speech that may constitute the practice of law, which means that you kind of have

90
0:07:11.320 --> 0:07:15.400
to wait and see what happens in court or take a very conservative approach and just leave

91
0:07:15.400 --> 0:07:18.720
it to the lawyers.

92
0:07:18.720 --> 0:07:23.800
So along those lines, I've already mentioned that there are lots of different penalties

93
0:07:23.800 --> 0:07:25.760
that anyone may face.

94
0:07:25.760 --> 0:07:29.640
But I also want to emphasize that this doesn't just apply to lawyers.

95
0:07:29.640 --> 0:07:32.560
This covers non-lawyers as well.

96
0:07:32.560 --> 0:07:40.720
So if anyone is familiar with the US TV show Suits, which is what made Meghan Markle quite

97
0:07:40.720 --> 0:07:47.040
famous, at least in the States, the main character is the quintessential case of the unauthorized

98
0:07:47.040 --> 0:07:48.040
practice of law.

99
0:07:48.040 --> 0:07:53.440
Someone that did not have a law license, didn't go to law school, and he pretended to be a

100
0:07:53.440 --> 0:07:54.440
lawyer.

101
0:07:54.440 --> 0:07:55.640
Surprise, surprise, he was brilliant.

102
0:07:55.640 --> 0:07:56.640
He does a great job.

103
0:07:56.640 --> 0:08:00.080
But there's always this looming specter that someone's going to find out and he's going

104
0:08:00.080 --> 0:08:03.600
to be in a lot of trouble for the unauthorized practice of law.

105
0:08:03.600 --> 0:08:06.240
So that's the typical case.

106
0:08:06.240 --> 0:08:09.040
But it also applies to lawyers.

107
0:08:09.040 --> 0:08:11.160
So just wanted to clarify that.

108
0:08:11.160 --> 0:08:15.320
Now I tried to distill the common elements.

109
0:08:15.320 --> 0:08:25.280
I read tons of cases, tons of articles and law journal notes and articles about this

110
0:08:25.280 --> 0:08:26.680
topic.

111
0:08:26.680 --> 0:08:33.880
And I was able to divide the most common elements of unauthorized practice of law or UPL into

112
0:08:33.880 --> 0:08:36.040
these two main buckets.

113
0:08:36.040 --> 0:08:38.560
And they're going to look nearly identical.

114
0:08:38.560 --> 0:08:41.440
But I'll talk through some of the distinctions in a moment.

115
0:08:41.440 --> 0:08:48.920
So the first bucket deals with legal advice that's given by a person or entity that does

116
0:08:48.920 --> 0:08:53.000
not have a law license in the relevant jurisdiction.

117
0:08:53.000 --> 0:08:56.160
Sounds like a bunch of nonsense and legalese.

118
0:08:56.160 --> 0:09:04.160
The second bucket is legal services for compensation given by a person or entity that does not

119
0:09:04.160 --> 0:09:06.840
have a law license in the relevant jurisdiction.

120
0:09:06.840 --> 0:09:12.680
So the clearest delineation that anyone could draw just by looking at the two of these is

121
0:09:12.680 --> 0:09:14.840
the first two bullet points.

122
0:09:14.840 --> 0:09:22.520
In particular, the legal services tends to specify that it's for compensation, whereas

123
0:09:22.520 --> 0:09:24.280
legal advice does not.

124
0:09:24.280 --> 0:09:33.240
So does that mean that if I provide legal services for free that I'm not liable for

125
0:09:33.240 --> 0:09:35.680
unauthorized practice of law?

126
0:09:35.680 --> 0:09:41.800
Unfortunately not, because some states will then deem or may deem your provision of legal

127
0:09:41.800 --> 0:09:45.240
services as also providing legal advice.

128
0:09:45.240 --> 0:09:48.880
And they don't distinguish in most cases giving legal advice.

129
0:09:48.880 --> 0:09:52.520
You can give that away for free and still be held liable.

130
0:09:52.520 --> 0:09:53.520
So isn't great.

131
0:09:53.520 --> 0:09:58.960
There are also a bunch of other nuanced distinctions that hopefully you'll start to see come through

132
0:09:58.960 --> 0:10:11.040
as I discuss the cases in how courts look at and distinguish between what is legal advice

133
0:10:11.040 --> 0:10:17.880
and what legal services are.

134
0:10:17.880 --> 0:10:24.000
So since I can't give you a definition for the practice of law, and we couldn't really

135
0:10:24.000 --> 0:10:31.000
back into it from looking at what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, let's talk

136
0:10:31.000 --> 0:10:35.200
about the public policy rationale for why this exists at all.

137
0:10:35.200 --> 0:10:41.400
This quote is from a 1952 Missouri Supreme Court case.

138
0:10:41.400 --> 0:10:46.640
And despite its age, I think it sums up the gist of the public policy rationale pretty

139
0:10:46.640 --> 0:10:47.640
well.

140
0:10:47.640 --> 0:10:50.600
At the end of the day, it comes down to consumer protection.

141
0:10:50.600 --> 0:10:56.480
This theoretically is not supposed to be about protecting lawyers and their livelihoods,

142
0:10:56.480 --> 0:11:02.320
creating a monopoly over who can give legal advice and provide legal services.

143
0:11:02.320 --> 0:11:07.960
What it's really supposed to do is protect the public and make sure that if they're getting

144
0:11:07.960 --> 0:11:13.840
advice, if they're relying on someone else, that it's actually reliable, that it's competent

145
0:11:13.840 --> 0:11:22.400
advice and that maybe there's some repercussions if that doesn't hold water.

146
0:11:22.400 --> 0:11:30.800
So in light of that great public policy theory, what does that actually look like in practice?

147
0:11:30.800 --> 0:11:38.000
The options for legal representation in the US come down to, well, you can do it yourself,

148
0:11:38.000 --> 0:11:39.000
all alone.

149
0:11:39.000 --> 0:11:44.240
You can do it through research, fill out your own forms, draft your own documents, file your

150
0:11:44.240 --> 0:11:45.240
own things.

151
0:11:45.240 --> 0:11:47.640
That's what we call pro se representation.

152
0:11:47.640 --> 0:11:50.800
Or you can hire a lawyer, which tends to be expensive.

153
0:11:50.800 --> 0:11:55.680
And if you don't already have a connection through family or friends to a lawyer, it

154
0:11:55.680 --> 0:11:59.760
can be really hard to track down the right person.

155
0:11:59.760 --> 0:12:06.960
And additionally, your claim may not be worth their time since they charge by the hour.

156
0:12:06.960 --> 0:12:13.840
And finally, in very limited circumstances, mostly confined to criminal cases, a court

157
0:12:13.840 --> 0:12:15.880
may actually appoint a lawyer to you.

158
0:12:15.880 --> 0:12:23.160
But that's not really a viable option for the vast majority of especially civil cases

159
0:12:23.160 --> 0:12:26.400
that deal with consumer protection.

160
0:12:26.400 --> 0:12:31.800
So how's that public policy rationale looking in practice?

161
0:12:31.800 --> 0:12:34.480
Clearly there's a bit of a disconnect.

162
0:12:34.480 --> 0:12:42.000
Additionally, the US is currently suffering from what many call a crisis in terms of access

163
0:12:42.000 --> 0:12:51.160
to justice, access to efficient, affordable, reasonable expectation of justice and the

164
0:12:51.160 --> 0:12:57.000
ability to interact with the justice system.

165
0:12:57.000 --> 0:13:03.360
And based on this quote and all of the other relevant demographics and statistics about

166
0:13:03.360 --> 0:13:12.360
this issue, it largely impacts low and middle income individuals who can't afford legal

167
0:13:12.360 --> 0:13:15.480
services.

168
0:13:15.480 --> 0:13:22.600
So to get back to the unauthorized practice of law, again, I wanted to try and find a

169
0:13:22.600 --> 0:13:31.680
way to describe the various ways that a court may consider, since we don't have clear definitions,

170
0:13:31.680 --> 0:13:38.560
what may bump over into the category, what may cross that fuzzy line into the unauthorized

171
0:13:38.560 --> 0:13:39.800
practice.

172
0:13:39.800 --> 0:13:47.120
And so these are various high level categories of what may tip the scales.

173
0:13:47.120 --> 0:13:51.800
But again, to clarify, there's no clear set framework that anyone is following.

174
0:13:51.800 --> 0:13:58.680
There's no set determination that, oh, well, if they disclaimed that they're not a lawyer

175
0:13:58.680 --> 0:14:05.560
and it's not legal advice like I did earlier, then it's clearly outside the realm and can't

176
0:14:05.560 --> 0:14:07.640
be held liable.

177
0:14:07.640 --> 0:14:09.400
There's no clear line drawn.

178
0:14:09.400 --> 0:14:16.480
If I am giving you legal advice for free, again, as I said, it very well may not be

179
0:14:16.480 --> 0:14:19.880
exempt from liability.

180
0:14:19.880 --> 0:14:24.400
So you'll see some of those factors come up again in these cases in the interest of time.

181
0:14:24.400 --> 0:14:27.000
Again, I want to kickstart the first case.

182
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:29.400
So this is Janssen versus LegalZoom.

183
0:14:29.400 --> 0:14:38.400
Quite some time ago, 2011, this was a case that took place in Missouri.

184
0:14:38.400 --> 0:14:46.400
And LegalZoom, for anyone who's not familiar, is a website that offers legal services throughout

185
0:14:46.400 --> 0:14:48.400
the United States.

186
0:14:48.400 --> 0:14:57.400
When they initially started, it was just their basic legal forms that someone could buy,

187
0:14:57.400 --> 0:15:01.400
print out, and fill in themselves and do whatever they wanted with.

188
0:15:01.400 --> 0:15:07.400
That's what the court considered the goods that LegalZoom offered.

189
0:15:07.400 --> 0:15:14.400
They expanded into building out a program, essentially a decision tree, where they provided

190
0:15:14.400 --> 0:15:20.400
questionnaires to their customers, and then would generate legal documents based on the

191
0:15:20.400 --> 0:15:21.400
user input.

192
0:15:21.400 --> 0:15:27.400
That's what the court, in this case, deemed the services that were provided for sale.

193
0:15:27.400 --> 0:15:32.160
Sorry, lost my place.

194
0:15:32.160 --> 0:15:38.080
So LegalZoom did make a lot of statements that they were not a law firm, they were not

195
0:15:38.080 --> 0:15:39.400
providing legal advice.

196
0:15:39.400 --> 0:15:51.400
This was meant to be self-help services, and no actual harm was cited in the case as being

197
0:15:51.400 --> 0:15:56.160
done to the public or to the actual customers of LegalZoom.

198
0:15:56.160 --> 0:16:01.800
Despite all of this, the court still found that the sale of the services constituted

199
0:16:01.800 --> 0:16:05.200
unauthorized practice of law.

200
0:16:05.200 --> 0:16:11.920
In particular, I wanted to call this to your attention, the court specifically honed in

201
0:16:11.920 --> 0:16:22.080
on the fact that a human had programmed the software to generate the legal documents.

202
0:16:22.080 --> 0:16:30.400
Since the human that programmed it was not a Missouri licensed attorney, but they had

203
0:16:30.400 --> 0:16:35.520
to have relied on Missouri law in order to generate documents that would affect a Missouri

204
0:16:35.520 --> 0:16:43.480
resident, that they clearly must have been making legal determinations, just like a Missouri

205
0:16:43.480 --> 0:16:48.360
licensed attorney would do a client intake and ask a series of questions of the client,

206
0:16:48.360 --> 0:16:52.720
and then use that to inform what documents they would choose and what content made it

207
0:16:52.720 --> 0:16:56.160
into those documents.

208
0:16:56.160 --> 0:17:03.720
The first open-ended question that I want you all to consider is this was decided just

209
0:17:03.720 --> 0:17:06.000
over 10 years ago now.

210
0:17:06.000 --> 0:17:14.160
How might the court have viewed this human programmer input if this were an AI model

211
0:17:14.160 --> 0:17:21.960
instead, based on where technology has come and where the layperson understanding of what

212
0:17:21.960 --> 0:17:24.000
technology is capable of doing?

213
0:17:24.000 --> 0:17:26.120
How might that affect how courts look at this?

214
0:17:26.120 --> 0:17:32.360
Let's fast forward 10 years to 2021.

215
0:17:32.360 --> 0:17:36.320
This is a Miami-based startup called Ticked.

216
0:17:36.320 --> 0:17:41.440
They were sued by the Florida Bar Association for allegedly violating the unauthorized practice

217
0:17:41.440 --> 0:17:44.680
of law regulations.

218
0:17:44.680 --> 0:17:52.160
Ticked had developed an app that would connect anyone who had gotten a traffic ticket with

219
0:17:52.160 --> 0:17:58.320
a licensed Florida attorney to resolve the case, and they did it for an upfront flat

220
0:17:58.320 --> 0:18:06.320
fee based on a percentage of the total violation fee on the face value of that ticket.

221
0:18:06.320 --> 0:18:07.600
It built an algorithm.

222
0:18:07.600 --> 0:18:09.700
This is the main business model.

223
0:18:09.700 --> 0:18:16.160
They built an algorithm that used court data on the likelihood of ticket being dismissed

224
0:18:16.160 --> 0:18:23.200
in court or being charged fees or accruing points in excess of the face value of the

225
0:18:23.200 --> 0:18:28.960
ticket to come up with what was actually going to be profitable, kind of like an insurance

226
0:18:28.960 --> 0:18:33.920
company will calculate the risk that you as a young, healthy person are going to suffer

227
0:18:33.920 --> 0:18:38.200
some catastrophic loss and they're going to have to pay big.

228
0:18:38.200 --> 0:18:43.240
It's probably a low likelihood, so they charge you, at least in the United States.

229
0:18:43.240 --> 0:18:44.800
Forgive the example.

230
0:18:44.800 --> 0:18:50.240
In the U.S., we get charged a lot of money to pay for our health insurance and usually

231
0:18:50.240 --> 0:18:55.680
don't see a return on that unless something really bad happens.

232
0:18:55.680 --> 0:18:59.520
That's a story for another time.

233
0:18:59.520 --> 0:19:07.440
To get back to the ticked case, they made it very, very clear in all of their website

234
0:19:07.440 --> 0:19:15.920
communications in their terms of service, everywhere on their site, that they were not

235
0:19:15.920 --> 0:19:17.280
providing legal services.

236
0:19:17.280 --> 0:19:21.000
They were going to connect you with a licensed attorney who would take over and handle the

237
0:19:21.000 --> 0:19:24.400
case for you.

238
0:19:24.400 --> 0:19:30.320
Their sole responsibility would be determining whether or not your case was a good fit, referring

239
0:19:30.320 --> 0:19:35.720
to a licensed attorney, and then negotiating that flat fee on your behalf with the attorney.

240
0:19:35.720 --> 0:19:38.440
They would take care of all the payments.

241
0:19:38.440 --> 0:19:42.960
Once the connection was made between the customer and the attorney, ticked removed itself from

242
0:19:42.960 --> 0:19:47.640
that relationship other than providing the financing to pay the attorney at any related

243
0:19:47.640 --> 0:19:48.640
costs.

244
0:19:48.640 --> 0:19:51.560
Likewise, the lawyers were not employees.

245
0:19:51.560 --> 0:19:54.640
I'm running out of time.

246
0:19:54.640 --> 0:19:58.060
To skip ahead, no harm was done.

247
0:19:58.060 --> 0:20:02.960
There were two groups that filed amicus briefs, one in support of the Florida Bar, one in

248
0:20:02.960 --> 0:20:06.720
support of ticked.

249
0:20:06.720 --> 0:20:08.360
Surprise surprise, they were at odds.

250
0:20:08.360 --> 0:20:11.640
One was a group of private practice attorneys in competition with ticked.

251
0:20:11.640 --> 0:20:19.040
The other was a group of consumer rights activists and legal aid services.

252
0:20:19.040 --> 0:20:22.200
Back to that public policy rationale.

253
0:20:22.200 --> 0:20:27.880
In a 4-3 decision in the Florida Supreme Court, they found that ticked was engaged in the

254
0:20:27.880 --> 0:20:35.560
unauthorized practice of law and cited a number of potential harms that may befall their customers,

255
0:20:35.560 --> 0:20:38.520
but no actual harm.

256
0:20:38.520 --> 0:20:41.000
This was enough justification.

257
0:20:41.000 --> 0:20:46.880
The majority had even said that they lauded the idea that technology was lowering the

258
0:20:46.880 --> 0:20:56.760
barrier of entry to getting legal services, to having public benefit and public convenience,

259
0:20:56.760 --> 0:21:02.840
but that still was not enough to knock out the unauthorized practice of law claims.

260
0:21:02.840 --> 0:21:06.840
The minority dissent, I'm not going to have time to cover it in full, but it's great if

261
0:21:06.840 --> 0:21:07.960
you have a chance to read it.

262
0:21:07.960 --> 0:21:09.600
I have citations in my slides.

263
0:21:09.600 --> 0:21:12.560
Essentially, they say, hey, this is a hedge.

264
0:21:12.560 --> 0:21:13.680
This is purely financial.

265
0:21:13.680 --> 0:21:16.200
It has nothing to do with law.

266
0:21:16.200 --> 0:21:21.000
All you're getting is certainty of this is the flat fee that I pay and that's all that

267
0:21:21.000 --> 0:21:22.480
I'm going to pay.

268
0:21:22.480 --> 0:21:27.560
It has nothing to do with legal, lawyers handle all of the legal stuff.

269
0:21:27.560 --> 0:21:32.200
This should not have been considered unauthorized practice of law.

270
0:21:32.200 --> 0:21:39.160
In Ray Peterson involved, I'm going to skip through this, forgive me, the nonprofit called

271
0:21:39.160 --> 0:21:41.160
Upsolve.

272
0:21:41.160 --> 0:21:47.040
Upsolve provides free legal services to low-income individuals to file for personal bankruptcy

273
0:21:47.040 --> 0:21:49.040
in the US.

274
0:21:49.040 --> 0:21:51.460
Again, no harm done.

275
0:21:51.460 --> 0:21:54.520
No fees charged.

276
0:21:54.520 --> 0:22:01.520
Upsolve was still found to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of law despite plenty

277
0:22:01.520 --> 0:22:06.360
of disclaimers relying on government issued forms and instruction sheets and publicly

278
0:22:06.360 --> 0:22:11.120
available information, making sure that they were only serving clients that had very basic

279
0:22:11.120 --> 0:22:17.480
cases that didn't require additional legal advice or input.

280
0:22:17.480 --> 0:22:22.760
Had a lot of controls in place, but unfortunately, it was not enough.

281
0:22:22.760 --> 0:22:32.200
Fortunately, unlike TIC, Upsolve was able to work with the bankruptcy court to make

282
0:22:32.200 --> 0:22:33.200
changes.

283
0:22:33.200 --> 0:22:36.520
They're currently working with the bankruptcy court to make changes to their program so

284
0:22:36.520 --> 0:22:42.360
that they can continue their services, whereas TIC actually had to shut down.

285
0:22:42.360 --> 0:22:49.440
They are no longer active and able to conduct business in the state of Florida.

286
0:22:49.440 --> 0:22:50.440
This is a handy chart.

287
0:22:50.440 --> 0:22:52.880
Again, forgive me for the time.

288
0:22:52.880 --> 0:22:57.720
We won't be able to get to everything, but I did want to note here in the three cases

289
0:22:57.720 --> 0:23:01.880
that I talked about, Upsolve is the only one that did not charge for their services, and

290
0:23:01.880 --> 0:23:08.080
yet they were still found to be in violation of unauthorized practice of law.

291
0:23:08.080 --> 0:23:14.760
In the legal Zoom case, I didn't cover this, but they were providing some direct filings

292
0:23:14.760 --> 0:23:22.360
on behalf of their customers, which in the case law is considered in court, which usually

293
0:23:22.360 --> 0:23:24.080
is a higher threshold.

294
0:23:24.080 --> 0:23:25.880
Everywhere else was out of court.

295
0:23:25.880 --> 0:23:29.400
There was no interaction with judges.

296
0:23:29.400 --> 0:23:31.520
There was no in-person representation.

297
0:23:31.520 --> 0:23:35.520
Finally, I wanted to distinguish the decisions.

298
0:23:35.520 --> 0:23:38.240
All three were unauthorized practice of law.

299
0:23:38.240 --> 0:23:40.080
Legal Zoom is still operating in Missouri.

300
0:23:40.080 --> 0:23:45.920
They settled the class action lawsuit, and they worked out a deal with the state in order

301
0:23:45.920 --> 0:23:52.320
to change some of their services and disclaimers and get around any future claims of unauthorized

302
0:23:52.320 --> 0:23:54.080
practice of law.

303
0:23:54.080 --> 0:24:00.480
Same in Upsolve, at least for now, but TIC did have to discontinue their services.

304
0:24:00.480 --> 0:24:07.640
One thing that I left out is that Upsolve, I found out this morning, which is why it's

305
0:24:07.640 --> 0:24:15.360
at the very end, Upsolve has released publicly some of their software on their GitHub org.

306
0:24:15.360 --> 0:24:16.600
I don't know.

307
0:24:16.600 --> 0:24:18.400
It wasn't cited in the case.

308
0:24:18.400 --> 0:24:21.800
It is free and available under open source licenses.

309
0:24:21.800 --> 0:24:26.560
I don't know if this was the software that was involved or at issue in the case.

310
0:24:26.560 --> 0:24:33.720
It wasn't specified, but interesting to note that open source software is involved.

311
0:24:33.720 --> 0:24:39.120
The reason that I'm bringing this up at the very end, I know I'm at time, is these are

312
0:24:39.120 --> 0:24:40.560
some additional open questions.

313
0:24:40.560 --> 0:24:46.680
In light of the various facts and elements that a court will consider in terms of what

314
0:24:46.680 --> 0:24:54.080
is the unauthorized practice of law, where it falls down, I wanted to address what effects

315
0:24:54.080 --> 0:24:55.720
this may have on FOSS projects.

316
0:24:55.720 --> 0:25:03.240
Everyone knows I'm not a lawyer, but I'm going to give you my opinion about something.

317
0:25:03.240 --> 0:25:07.440
Licenses contain warranties and disclaimers, et cetera.

318
0:25:07.440 --> 0:25:09.920
I don't have time to cover all of this.

319
0:25:09.920 --> 0:25:11.640
Forgive me again.

320
0:25:11.640 --> 0:25:12.640
You've been a great audience.

321
0:25:12.640 --> 0:25:15.720
I really appreciate your patience with me.

322
0:25:15.720 --> 0:25:16.720
Please check out the slides.

323
0:25:16.720 --> 0:25:19.760
They're already uploaded.
