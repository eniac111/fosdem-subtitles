WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.880
We are getting there.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.880
We are almost there.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.800
I keep encouraging everybody to take more Haribo, but I don't think we have enough left

00:22.800 --> 00:25.000
to encourage massive runs on the Haribo.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.560
We also have Ritter Sport, if you need it.

00:31.560 --> 00:36.520
Wonderful humans, I live in the town where they make the Haribo gummy candies, so please

00:36.520 --> 00:37.600
take the gummy candies.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.800
I can get more easily.

00:39.800 --> 00:49.400
Do not need the extras to go back on the train with me to Germany.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.080
While we are getting set up and having a little bit of additional technical difficulty, all

00:54.080 --> 00:58.840
of us are getting ready to go back on the train.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.560
I am getting very happy over here because we have our next generation of Fosdomers hanging

01:01.560 --> 01:03.480
out and getting candy now too.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.080
Sadly I couldn't bring my daughter with me, but when she was all of 33 days old, she went

01:15.080 --> 01:17.920
to her first Fosdom.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.000
I am looking forward to her next Fosdom.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.400
No, although I did get one conference to make her a lanyard that said future speaker, so

01:30.400 --> 01:33.080
that made me feel happy.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.880
I think I am going to try and bring her to DevConf this year if at all possible.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.480
The German school system is very rigorous about thou shalt not miss school time, so

01:41.480 --> 01:46.000
it's a little more difficult.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.280
We'll.

01:50.280 --> 01:58.160
La la la la.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.320
If you want to la la la la la, you totally can.

02:03.320 --> 02:07.120
There may be karaoke coming on.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.760
I know you're going to leave.

02:08.760 --> 02:14.600
It's worth the risk to me to entertain our adoring public, Mr. Prophet, but we will try

02:14.600 --> 02:18.000
and avoid it because we care for you.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.040
Is everybody both enjoying their Fosdom and exhausted and ready to go home?

02:23.040 --> 02:26.240
Yes, okay, that's all right.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.280
Sometimes exhaustion is where we end up, but in the good way, in the we're full of happiness

02:30.280 --> 02:34.120
and good ideas way and filled with delicious candy.

02:34.120 --> 02:39.240
Welcome, welcome, welcome, lovely people who are just joining us.

02:39.240 --> 02:47.920
We're still working on convincing the, watch me go.

02:47.920 --> 02:55.120
Everybody centering DEI in your open source project.

02:55.120 --> 03:11.780
Okay, on the topics, good.

03:11.780 --> 03:38.500
Hi, everybody.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.700
It's great to be here and it's great to see people.

03:41.700 --> 03:50.700
I'm Matt German-Prey and I'm one of the co-founders of the Chaos Project and I'm also a professor

03:50.700 --> 03:55.820
by day at the University of Nebraska Omaha in the College of Information Science and

03:55.820 --> 03:58.580
Technology and it's really great to be here.

03:58.580 --> 04:06.340
So just real briefly, I'm going to be giving this talk with Justin and Kristi so they can

04:06.340 --> 04:11.460
kind of introduce themselves when they come up and we also have a slide that introduces

04:11.460 --> 04:13.120
them as well.

04:13.120 --> 04:19.980
So the Chaos Project, as Dawn was actually alluding to in her last talk, which was a

04:19.980 --> 04:27.660
great segue, is a project that's focused on open source health and sustainability.

04:27.660 --> 04:34.400
So creating metrics and software as well as programs because there are a lot of metrics

04:34.400 --> 04:41.980
that can't necessarily be determined through software that require qualitative and human

04:41.980 --> 04:44.540
efforts to understand.

04:44.540 --> 04:50.300
So we develop those types of metrics and software and programs.

04:50.300 --> 04:56.460
As part of what we do in the Chaos Project, diversity, equity and inclusion is a key component

04:56.460 --> 05:02.380
to understand with respect to the health and sustainability of projects.

05:02.380 --> 05:09.260
And for ourselves, we looked at the Chaos Project and thought how can we not only help

05:09.260 --> 05:16.020
others think about diversity, equity and inclusion with respect to their projects, but also reflect

05:16.020 --> 05:20.980
ourselves about our own diversity, equity and inclusion.

05:20.980 --> 05:26.620
So how can we as a project better center diversity, equity and inclusion within the Chaos Project

05:26.620 --> 05:32.660
and then subsequently help others do the same from our experience?

05:32.660 --> 05:39.140
So I would like to first say thanks to the Ford Foundation who has provided support for

05:39.140 --> 05:45.060
this reflection over the last, it's been a year and a half now, and it'll complete in

05:45.060 --> 05:49.020
about two, it'll complete in about another six months.

05:49.020 --> 05:54.140
And so through the support from the Ford Foundation, it's been really great because we've been

05:54.140 --> 06:00.720
able to have consistency in our team of people helping us do the reflection, including Kristi

06:00.720 --> 06:07.420
and Justin, as well as come to places like FOSDIM and talk about our experience and what

06:07.420 --> 06:11.580
we've learned and share that with other people.

06:11.580 --> 06:17.340
So the team, oh that got cut off a little, it's close.

06:17.340 --> 06:24.100
So the team, Celia got cut off, so we have Kristi, we have Justin, we have Sean, Guy,

06:24.100 --> 06:24.420
and

06:24.420 --> 06:25.420
and

06:25.420 --> 06:29.740
Gagans, we have Georgia Bulin, who's there in the center, we have Elizabeth Barron, who

06:29.740 --> 06:36.860
is the Chaos Community Manager, we have Ruth Ikega, who couldn't come, she's on the right,

06:36.860 --> 06:43.060
and then in the upper right corner I think you only see a very small part of Cela, but

06:43.060 --> 06:49.340
it's Cela Yang, who is also part of the team for this reflection, and then myself in the

06:49.340 --> 06:51.060
lower right hand corner.

06:51.060 --> 06:54.460
So it's been an amazing group of people, and like I said, through the Ford Foundation

06:54.460 --> 07:02.420
support we've been able to stay together as a team throughout the entire reflection.

07:02.420 --> 07:07.780
So here are the speakers, again, Justin you're cut off.

07:07.780 --> 07:12.020
That's okay, hopefully there aren't a lot of words that get cut off there when we show

07:12.020 --> 07:13.780
what we're showing.

07:13.780 --> 07:18.740
But again, I'm Matt Gerwinpre, we have Kristi Progrie and Justin Flori, and I think Justin's

07:18.740 --> 07:23.420
going to talk kind of about our first, we have four things that we're going to talk

07:23.420 --> 07:28.060
about that were part of this reflection, and Justin will talk about two of them, and Kristi

07:28.060 --> 07:32.500
will also talk about two of them, and then we'd really love to kind of hear from you

07:32.500 --> 07:36.620
all and answer questions the best that we can or any thoughts that you might have.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.820
So Justin, I'm going to turn it over to you.

07:38.820 --> 07:42.980
Should we do quick round introductions too of all of us?

07:42.980 --> 07:45.820
I'm done, I met Gerwinpre.

07:45.820 --> 07:52.060
I'm Justin Flori, so I'm currently with Red Hat as the Fedora community architect, so

07:52.060 --> 07:56.700
I'm working in the Fedora community day by day, but I've also been involved with the

07:56.700 --> 08:00.420
Chaos Project that we're going to be talking a little bit about here for the last five

08:00.420 --> 08:06.220
years, and then working with our awesome group of folks on this DEI review for the last two.

08:06.220 --> 08:12.180
Hello everyone, so I'm Kristi Progrie, I'm currently the program manager for the GNOME

08:12.180 --> 08:19.260
Foundation, and I'm also part of the Chaos community for around one year and a half now,

08:19.260 --> 08:24.180
and also contributing in their diversity and inclusion working group.

08:24.180 --> 08:28.500
I'm going to go sit down.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.500
Yes.

08:29.500 --> 08:35.500
All right, so let's look at the first two points of our reflection.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.740
So again, this was just the background context again.

08:38.740 --> 08:43.820
So this was work that we started about two years ago, and we were coming into this reflection.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.940
We were starting really from the very beginning.

08:47.940 --> 08:52.620
We were going to take a look at the Chaos Project to understand where could we better

08:52.620 --> 08:58.060
focus our efforts and spend our time and energy and resources to make things better.

08:58.060 --> 09:02.900
So over that journey, the four points that we're going to be sharing here are basically

09:02.900 --> 09:07.520
the outcomes of this journey that we've been on for the last two years.

09:07.520 --> 09:11.660
So you're getting a little bit more of the polished end result of this, so it'll be

09:11.660 --> 09:13.420
nice bullet point list.

09:13.420 --> 09:17.100
But you can also keep in mind that when we started with this reflection, we were kind

09:17.100 --> 09:18.620
of like, where do we begin?

09:18.620 --> 09:24.500
And this was a lot of conversations that brought us to this point and engaging with our community

09:24.500 --> 09:31.460
to learn some of these things that helped us define some of our efforts.

09:31.460 --> 09:35.180
So without further ado, the four highlights.

09:35.180 --> 09:38.780
Whoops, there's a little bit of a lag.

09:38.780 --> 09:41.860
Okay, we didn't get it all cut off.

09:41.860 --> 09:46.980
So I'll be talking a little bit around our newcomer initiatives and engagements, and

09:46.980 --> 09:51.260
also talk a little bit around our global efforts.

09:51.260 --> 09:55.780
So across the span of the last two years, no, I guess I kind of already covered this.

09:55.780 --> 09:58.940
So the first part on the newcomer experience.

09:58.940 --> 10:04.580
So with the creation of new support structures, along with an increased emphasis on mentoring,

10:04.580 --> 10:09.980
the chaos project has grown a lot, really tremendously with new contributors in the

10:09.980 --> 10:12.420
last couple of years.

10:12.420 --> 10:18.100
New onboarding pathways were developed, and we prioritize the refinement of these pathways

10:18.100 --> 10:19.100
too.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.620
I might say part of this was also kind of the right time at the right place, because

10:22.620 --> 10:26.940
I think as we were kind of going into COVID as well, and everything was really shifting

10:26.940 --> 10:32.260
into a virtual format, as we were spending more time thinking about the newcomer experience,

10:32.260 --> 10:36.700
I also think there was more of an interest in folks trying to get involved with open

10:36.700 --> 10:41.540
source projects, which also opened the door for lots of folks that we ended up engaging

10:41.540 --> 10:45.500
with from countries and places all over the world.

10:45.500 --> 10:51.620
So ultimately, many of us long time FOSS contributors remember well what it is like to get involved

10:51.620 --> 10:56.420
in a new project, and trying to figure out where do you begin.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.380
It's easy to get overwhelmed.

10:58.380 --> 11:03.100
And ultimately, many of us long time FOSS contributors remember well what it's like,

11:03.100 --> 11:09.100
or at the same time, ensuring newcomers have a clear pathway to get onboarded is important

11:09.100 --> 11:13.980
for project sustainability and keeping things going.

11:13.980 --> 11:18.300
So new faces should always be coming and going, as well as mingling with the older faces and

11:18.300 --> 11:20.320
people that have been in the community.

11:20.320 --> 11:25.200
So keeping those signs of folks who have been around for a long while while also still having

11:25.200 --> 11:30.740
new faces coming into the fold and the mix is important for community growth and sustainability.

11:30.740 --> 11:37.580
Additionally, newcomers have that unique perspective as a first time observer to your community.

11:37.580 --> 11:42.500
And you can learn a lot by listening actively to them and their perspectives that they're

11:42.500 --> 11:44.540
bringing to your community.

11:44.540 --> 11:51.740
So one key takeaway here is helping newcomers see and understand the impact of their work.

11:51.740 --> 11:55.020
It's important to validate the small contributions.

11:55.020 --> 11:59.340
In a way, you almost need to hype people up on their participation.

11:59.340 --> 12:03.420
It feels great, actually kind of like what Don was just talking about in the last talk,

12:03.420 --> 12:08.100
it feels great when you know your efforts are appreciated and made a difference to someone

12:08.100 --> 12:11.820
else, all that soft squishy human stuff.

12:11.820 --> 12:18.100
So one wish list item for developing metrics or measurements in a FOSS project is showing

12:18.100 --> 12:22.220
and measuring the impact of a newcomer contribution.

12:22.220 --> 12:26.700
So both trying to come up with a way to measure and understand that, but also kind of around

12:26.700 --> 12:31.620
this recognition piece of making sure that the people making that contribution also understand

12:31.620 --> 12:34.140
that impact of their contribution.

12:34.140 --> 12:38.820
Additionally, newcomers need to feel safe and welcome in the community.

12:38.820 --> 12:44.620
They need space to try out new ideas and more importantly, to make mistakes and mess up

12:44.620 --> 12:47.380
because that's where you really learn.

12:47.380 --> 12:53.180
So having a safe environment is important for people to test and validate their wildest

12:53.180 --> 12:58.620
ideas and a welcoming community gives them the opportunity to bounce back when something

12:58.620 --> 13:00.500
doesn't work out.

13:00.500 --> 13:06.500
So one key part of unlocking creativity and innovation is making sure that people bring

13:06.500 --> 13:12.060
their best and that a newcomer has the space that they need to bring their best while they're

13:12.060 --> 13:16.060
learning more about the project and the community.

13:16.060 --> 13:21.660
In short, avoid this tendency to over-celebrate your long-term contributors.

13:21.660 --> 13:27.580
We also want to recognize those folks, but I really like, I think it was someone in our

13:27.580 --> 13:31.780
group who put it as the emphasis is really to share the spotlight.

13:31.780 --> 13:36.500
So making sure that there's an equitable focus of how you're recognizing and validating people's

13:36.500 --> 13:39.540
contributions in your community.

13:39.540 --> 13:45.100
And also kind of a side point, or not only side point, but the importance of diversity

13:45.100 --> 13:49.700
and leadership I think is a tie-in here with that newcomer experience.

13:49.700 --> 13:54.820
So it's kind of an unwritten point in the slide deck here, but in our Chaos DEI review

13:54.820 --> 13:59.740
team we have one of the people who we really wanted to be here, Ruth Akega, who has done

13:59.740 --> 14:04.380
a lot with that newcomer onboarding in the Chaos Project.

14:04.380 --> 14:09.180
She was really hands-on with the mentoring and onboarding of the new contributors, especially

14:09.180 --> 14:13.380
across Western Africa where she's originally from.

14:13.380 --> 14:18.260
And Ruth worked directly with the newcomers, but also brought visibility to the challenges

14:18.260 --> 14:23.500
and issues, but also the success points for the people she was working with to our group,

14:23.500 --> 14:26.300
to the DEI review team.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.100
So in the same way, she was very hands-on with engaging with those people, but she was

14:30.100 --> 14:35.620
also sharing these experiences back with our review team so that we had better visibility

14:35.620 --> 14:36.820
and insight to that.

14:36.820 --> 14:41.180
So at the more, I guess a higher level in the project, we could think how could we align,

14:41.180 --> 14:46.180
again, our time, resources, and energy to make sure that we're supporting and welcoming

14:46.180 --> 14:50.500
in all these new people to the project community.

14:50.500 --> 14:55.740
So the takeaway on this point is to choose folks from regions, especially with less representation,

14:55.740 --> 15:00.540
to try to encourage them into these leadership roles or find somewhere in the project where

15:00.540 --> 15:02.700
they can make that impact.

15:02.700 --> 15:09.140
It makes it easier to build relationships with those newcomers to the project.

15:09.140 --> 15:12.900
I think, oh, global efforts, right.

15:12.900 --> 15:17.500
So when you're trying to fix things, challenges are going to come up.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.660
It's important to have this persistence in the face of challenges when necessary.

15:21.660 --> 15:28.460
And when you're trying to pivot a project's focus toward DEI challenges, or towards DEI,

15:28.460 --> 15:31.500
these challenges are going to be inevitable.

15:31.500 --> 15:38.780
The work is a kind of cultural, organizational culture work, and that stuff is really hard.

15:38.780 --> 15:43.460
So again, there's kind of this piece that there's a historical resistance to change.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.540
Change is hard.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.540
We don't like it.

15:47.540 --> 15:51.420
Sometimes there's a, I read this, there's actually a comic I was reading a while back

15:51.420 --> 15:55.660
that we have this part in our brain that when we, there's something that's challenging our

15:55.660 --> 15:58.340
beliefs or ideals that we kind of freeze up.

15:58.340 --> 16:02.180
It's almost as if someone was threatening us with something violent, but it might just

16:02.180 --> 16:05.740
be changing our mindset or ideas.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.380
And what I'm going with this is that the change is really hard.

16:08.380 --> 16:15.020
And so we can help make it easier to evolve and adapt to change.

16:15.020 --> 16:24.180
So I think one part of this as well is that we're not also in a, you know, escape room

16:24.180 --> 16:25.980
or echo chamber doing this work.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.460
We're kind of all in this together.

16:28.460 --> 16:32.420
One of the data points to mention here as well is again, coming back to both the chaos

16:32.420 --> 16:37.420
Africa piece, which is where we had a lot of that newcomer growth was we had over 200,

16:37.420 --> 16:40.700
over 200 new community members who joined into our project.

16:40.700 --> 16:46.220
And that was across five different focus groups of development and design and research and

16:46.220 --> 16:48.180
technical writing and community management.

16:48.180 --> 16:53.020
I think it also ties into one of the efforts around our new website, which is underway

16:53.020 --> 16:57.820
for the chaos project, which has been a huge contribution from all these newcomers who

16:57.820 --> 17:02.780
have helped shape and influence how we're kind of opening or presenting the front door

17:02.780 --> 17:07.860
of our project and making it easier for people to find the things they're looking for.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.980
And also the over 900 plus folks following the new chaos Africa Twitter account as another

17:12.980 --> 17:15.140
data point.

17:15.140 --> 17:19.700
And our folks in the Asia Pacific community, there's also been a ongoing connection with

17:19.700 --> 17:23.700
the to do group supported by the Linux Foundation and GitHub.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.940
Or sorry, I misread that.

17:25.940 --> 17:31.420
So this they're doing work with the to do group around trying to support some of these

17:31.420 --> 17:34.100
efforts and grow the community there as well.

17:34.100 --> 17:39.500
So I think from here I will pass it over to Kristi to take us into the last two points

17:39.500 --> 17:44.140
of our what we're here to share with you today for the reflection.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.100
Great.

17:46.100 --> 17:50.300
Thank you, Justin.

17:50.300 --> 17:55.220
One other important, very important part of our community and one of the most successful

17:55.220 --> 17:59.100
initiatives, let's say, has been the badging.

17:59.100 --> 18:05.180
So the badging is meant the badging review is meant for self reflection and improvement

18:05.180 --> 18:12.140
on how many different communities and how many different conferences are implementing

18:12.140 --> 18:17.020
and are centering diversity, equity and inclusion.

18:17.020 --> 18:20.660
This initiative uses chaos matrix.

18:20.660 --> 18:28.420
And the way that it works is that we have an organizer of a conference applying on our

18:28.420 --> 18:29.420
website.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.060
We have two forms.

18:31.060 --> 18:38.420
One application is for all online events and the other application is for in person events.

18:38.420 --> 18:43.180
And the person who is applying actually goes through all the application, answers different

18:43.180 --> 18:44.180
questions.

18:44.180 --> 18:49.340
And we have two reviews, two reviewers that actually go through the application.

18:49.340 --> 18:56.540
And then by the end of the review, we also give the badge to the to the specific conference

18:56.540 --> 19:01.060
or the community that has applied for this.

19:01.060 --> 19:06.740
And it's also like this badging review has four different levels.

19:06.740 --> 19:11.900
And depending on how you're centering, we also give the reviews.

19:11.900 --> 19:18.580
In our community, we also give support and lessons learned from many people on how you

19:18.580 --> 19:24.820
can improve and how you can actually work more in your community to center diversity,

19:24.820 --> 19:31.220
equity and inclusion.

19:31.220 --> 19:37.140
Another initiative, let's say, in our community has been the survey.

19:37.140 --> 19:43.660
We started the community survey by October 20, 22nd.

19:43.660 --> 19:52.380
So in this survey, the idea was to get a general idea of how the experience of the community

19:52.380 --> 19:57.180
is going, what we are doing well, what needs more improvement.

19:57.180 --> 20:03.180
So by collecting all this data, we were able to work more on the things that we want to

20:03.180 --> 20:06.660
see more improved for the next years.

20:06.660 --> 20:12.140
The idea of this survey was to create a structure that could help also other communities to

20:12.140 --> 20:13.700
implement it.

20:13.700 --> 20:17.020
And we have asked many demographic questions.

20:17.020 --> 20:25.460
When the results will come out, we would like to give or to publicize this survey online

20:25.460 --> 20:32.460
with all the structures so everyone that would like to implement it in their respective communities,

20:32.460 --> 20:35.300
they can do so.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.540
It's a very demanding work.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.220
It takes a lot of energy and time.

20:39.220 --> 20:48.300
So we would love to give this work to others to make their lives better.

20:48.300 --> 21:00.500
And for a quick summary, so for our two years journey, there are definitely surprises going

21:00.500 --> 21:01.500
on.

21:01.500 --> 21:07.220
And we had things that we need to do during this whole process.

21:07.220 --> 21:11.900
So it's not, you know, sometimes things don't really go in the way that we have planned

21:11.900 --> 21:16.860
it, but the most important thing is to actually finish with the results that we wanted to

21:16.860 --> 21:22.180
and to accomplish the goals that we set ourselves to.

21:22.180 --> 21:27.460
Another main idea and another big lesson that we have learned throughout our journey is

21:27.460 --> 21:35.180
that supporting contributors and making onboarding process smooth actually helps us to have a

21:35.180 --> 21:42.180
better community, to have a healthier community, and to be able to get as many contributors

21:42.180 --> 21:44.380
as possible.

21:44.380 --> 21:51.020
And also the other last takeaway is that the community surveys are actually very important

21:51.020 --> 21:56.020
because it is a very good way to understand what is going on in your community, how can

21:56.020 --> 22:03.460
you help, and what other things that you can appreciate or that you can feel proud of,

22:03.460 --> 22:05.700
let's say.

22:05.700 --> 22:09.180
So this was all the presentation that we had for today.

22:09.180 --> 22:12.820
Thank you all for joining our talk.

22:12.820 --> 22:16.900
And feel free, if you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer you.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.900
Thank you.

22:17.900 --> 22:35.060
I'm going to put that QR code on the live survey.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.060
I'll do that.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.060
If I know how.

22:37.060 --> 22:38.060
Yeah, it gets got here.

22:38.060 --> 22:39.060
Yeah, can I?

22:39.060 --> 22:48.500
You can also upload the PDFs to the post-op site.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.500
Hi.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
Are you finished?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.500
What's that?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.500
Yeah.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.500
Are you finished?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
Yeah, we're done.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
Okay.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.500
Should we take any questions?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.500
So I think, yeah, we have about eight minutes left.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.540
Do we have, yeah, I see one question here from the audience.

23:02.540 --> 23:05.540
Yeah, it's an issue.

23:05.540 --> 23:10.940
Thanks, guys.

23:10.940 --> 23:15.180
It was a great talk and great insight.

23:15.180 --> 23:19.820
One of the questions that I had was, so you mentioned that improving the onboarding process

23:19.820 --> 23:24.340
made it easier to retain contributors down the line.

23:24.340 --> 23:31.300
Do you have any insight as to why you think that one might have contributed to the other?

23:31.300 --> 23:37.780
Because oftentimes I've seen in other projects where we've done work to help improve the

23:37.780 --> 23:44.140
on-ramps and we do see a large influx of people, but over time as well, there's still a fair

23:44.140 --> 23:45.300
amount of attrition.

23:45.300 --> 23:50.940
So I was just wondering what your insights were based on what you saw from the work you've

23:50.940 --> 23:51.940
done.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.940
Sure.

23:52.940 --> 23:53.940
Thanks.

23:53.940 --> 23:54.980
Yeah, thank you for that.

23:54.980 --> 24:01.580
So as far as a lot of our newcomer experience, I can tell you about a couple things that

24:01.580 --> 24:06.460
we've been doing just in that regard, and then I'll speak to kind of how I think it

24:06.460 --> 24:09.940
has helped retain people as well.

24:09.940 --> 24:14.100
So from the newcomer experience, a lot of the work that we have done are open office

24:14.100 --> 24:18.180
hours, which have worked really quite well.

24:18.180 --> 24:21.380
They're unstructured hours every week.

24:21.380 --> 24:27.740
We also have one hour a week of kind of structured talk about the project itself.

24:27.740 --> 24:33.300
So it's usually led by Ruth or by Elizabeth, who's the community manager, using a slide

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
deck.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.300
You know what I mean?

24:35.300 --> 24:36.300
That's a little bit more structured in time.

24:36.300 --> 24:42.820
The other thing that we had to reflect on was in terms of the newcomer experience, for

24:42.820 --> 24:51.620
a lot of us, it was not actually going out as far as how to make a commit or how to do

24:51.620 --> 25:01.380
a PR, but they were usually easier things like, here's the meeting to attend, and we

25:01.380 --> 25:05.340
encourage you to attend this meeting twice.

25:05.340 --> 25:07.540
And this would be, say, our general meeting.

25:07.540 --> 25:11.740
And then once you've attended the general meeting twice, we encourage you to attend

25:11.740 --> 25:16.660
a working group meeting, kind of a smaller level meeting, say four times.

25:16.660 --> 25:26.820
And what we find is that by doing this, it helps create the vocabulary for folks to understand

25:26.820 --> 25:27.820
what it is.

25:27.820 --> 25:29.580
So sometimes the commit is kind of far out there.

25:29.580 --> 25:32.100
A poll request is kind of far out there.

25:32.100 --> 25:38.720
So in doing that, we also had a better opportunity to understand why people were joining.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.340
So it was kind of on us to understand why.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.860
And then the earlier talk about the different types of contributions, I don't know if you

25:46.860 --> 25:50.860
were here, there was one that was like not just technical contributions, but all the

25:50.860 --> 25:52.940
different types of contributions.

25:52.940 --> 25:59.540
It then becomes kind of our responsibility as the community folk, you know, like the

25:59.540 --> 26:07.660
community managers, to identify what those hopes are from people and how to contribute,

26:07.660 --> 26:10.900
and then really try to focus in on pairing that.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.420
So hopefully that helps a little bit.

26:13.420 --> 26:19.940
So it's not just putting out documents that are for the newcomer experience, but you have

26:19.940 --> 26:25.140
to be really active along that path as well.

26:25.140 --> 26:26.140
Did you want to comment, too?

26:26.140 --> 26:29.940
I'll just do one more callout to something that I thought worked really well in this

26:29.940 --> 26:30.940
as well.

26:30.940 --> 26:33.140
It was Elizabeth Barron, I think, Ruth, too.

26:33.140 --> 26:37.820
We're doing kind of like individualized like mentor sessions with folks who wanted like

26:37.820 --> 26:41.900
some extra guidance or had questions and weren't really sure where to go.

26:41.900 --> 26:46.900
Talking to a real human being and getting some of that individualized support, I think,

26:46.900 --> 26:50.400
also made it easier for folks to feel connected to the project.

26:50.400 --> 26:55.020
And so when things got hard or things weren't clear, there was always a way that they could

26:55.020 --> 26:58.420
they had like kind of a buddy in the community to help kind of help them through.

26:58.420 --> 27:03.580
And I think that was also kind of a big part of the retention piece.

27:03.580 --> 27:10.420
I also think that an important part of the onboarding process and to make it as easier

27:10.420 --> 27:16.580
as possible is to also have a good documentation on how people at least can get started.

27:16.580 --> 27:21.580
And by having some very specific steps, it makes people more comfortable and it makes

27:21.580 --> 27:25.340
people feel that they know where they're actually going.

27:25.340 --> 27:30.940
So having actionable items helps you with the path forward.

27:30.940 --> 27:36.580
Do we have other questions for our fine speakers?

27:36.580 --> 27:38.580
We have about three minutes.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.580
How many?

27:39.580 --> 27:40.580
Three minutes.

27:40.580 --> 27:41.580
Three seconds.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.580
Ah, I see.

27:43.580 --> 27:52.820
Is it helpful to have an onboarding buddy for each person, a mentor for their first

27:52.820 --> 27:54.300
stage?

27:54.300 --> 27:59.780
I think that assigning someone specific to every new commerce may be a little bit too

27:59.780 --> 28:05.860
demanding because there might be like a certain amount of people coming all at the same time

28:05.860 --> 28:10.700
and maybe we don't have the manpower to assist each one with an individual mentor.

28:10.700 --> 28:15.260
But I think that having one mentor for three or four people, for a set group of people,

28:15.260 --> 28:22.660
would be easier to coordinate and to organize.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.660
It's a good question.

28:23.660 --> 28:29.300
I don't think we've sorted it out yet, but in terms of having a one-on-one, to Christie's

28:29.300 --> 28:32.500
point would be a lot of work.

28:32.500 --> 28:37.380
So how we sort that out, I don't think we have that quite clear yet.

28:37.380 --> 28:42.260
Maybe just one corollary point to that is I think in Fedora, we have also like a join

28:42.260 --> 28:45.300
special interest group of folks who kind of buddy up with folks.

28:45.300 --> 28:49.340
I think what's helped with that to make it scale is that there's a process that anyone

28:49.340 --> 28:53.480
who wants to even do that mentoring work knows how they can help people.

28:53.480 --> 28:57.820
So it makes it easier not just for newcomers to find someone to get kind of help buddy

28:57.820 --> 29:01.860
up with them, but there's also a way for the people who want to be buddies to help connect

29:01.860 --> 29:02.860
with the newcomers too.

29:02.860 --> 29:07.660
So I think that might be one way to help make it easier to scale because one-to-one is,

29:07.660 --> 29:12.260
it only goes, it only reach, can go so far with that before you hit your limit.

29:12.260 --> 29:18.140
Anyone else have a question for our wonderful presenters?

29:18.140 --> 29:19.140
Very good.

29:19.140 --> 29:20.140
On my way.

29:20.140 --> 29:29.620
Hi.

29:29.620 --> 29:38.700
I was wondering if after the two years of research, do you review your metrics process to have

29:38.700 --> 29:44.140
another understanding what does health in the community mean?

29:44.140 --> 29:46.380
Yeah.

29:46.380 --> 29:49.100
So as part of this process.

29:49.100 --> 29:52.100
So the CAS project also publishes metrics.

29:52.100 --> 29:56.880
So as part of what we're learning, that's going right into the development of new metrics.

29:56.880 --> 30:01.700
So that would be the publishing that we're doing in part.

30:01.700 --> 30:12.060
I think we're also in the stage right now of how we.
