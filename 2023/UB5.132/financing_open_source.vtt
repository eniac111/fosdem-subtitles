00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Dr. Rodjinska.

00:01.000 --> 00:24.840
Raise your hand if you think that open source projects have too much money.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.920
I hope that there will be someone here who raises their hand and they can come and do

00:29.920 --> 00:33.480
the talk instead of me because they know better.

00:33.480 --> 00:37.520
But unfortunately none of you.

00:37.520 --> 00:43.400
I'm going to convince yourself, convince, no myself I'm already convinced, convince

00:43.400 --> 00:52.360
yourself that we can find us open source by small companies.

00:52.360 --> 00:56.400
We are giving 1% of the income to open source projects.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.960
I'm going to convince you that all of the small companies in open source can do that.

01:00.960 --> 01:07.320
And we can change, we can change much in the open source world with that.

01:07.320 --> 01:12.240
Do you know what it can be?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.240
23.1 million.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.240
Huh?

01:17.240 --> 01:19.240
Hard question.

01:19.240 --> 01:24.520
That's the number of small companies in the European Union.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.520
Wow.

01:26.520 --> 01:33.840
How many of them do the computer science, how many of them use open source every day?

01:33.840 --> 01:35.680
How many use open source every day?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.840
I would say half probably.

01:37.840 --> 01:44.400
But how many are contributing and are constant users of open source?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.480
Way harder to ask.

01:46.480 --> 01:53.600
I would assume that at least 5,000.

01:53.600 --> 02:03.360
Imagine now that 5,000 companies which is not that optimistic estimate, each of them

02:03.360 --> 02:05.840
giving 1,000 euros per year.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.920
The total budget you get is 5 million.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.120
What we can do for 5 million europe?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.120
Quite much.

02:12.120 --> 02:19.520
And 1,000 euros per company, it's not high number, it's really a pessimistic estimate.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.280
So we can do way better than that.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.720
Before we get to the details of the Prod.

02:27.720 --> 02:35.160
Smart Dictionary Check, we are in Europe, all of us talking about taxes, incomes and

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
financial things.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.760
We are using our own languages.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.120
And we need to have a dictionary check when we are switching to English.

02:43.120 --> 02:51.280
So turnover, income, grocery venue, same thing, it's all sales of a company over a

02:51.280 --> 02:53.680
period of time, usually a year.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.080
And profit, it's earning minus all of the expenses that you have.

02:59.080 --> 03:07.520
What I'm convincing you that you can give one person of the income so all sales a year.

03:07.520 --> 03:14.160
Now my personal point of view.

03:14.160 --> 03:22.520
SyslineBit is a company running multiple economic activities under one roof and we are helping

03:22.520 --> 03:26.040
new activities and new people to be the activities.

03:26.040 --> 03:32.800
It's a pretty specific type of a company under the Fetch Law called CIO.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.960
We are concentrating on embedded and open source.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.120
So we are strong supporters of open source.

03:38.120 --> 03:44.520
Currently in our model, everyone is a consultant but we welcome production, system admins and

03:44.520 --> 03:47.560
all the types of activities.

03:47.560 --> 03:56.880
And now currently every consultant gives one person of their income to open source project.

03:56.880 --> 04:03.560
As we hold multiple independent activities, every person decides on their own to which

04:03.560 --> 04:09.640
project they want to give because we have different preferences.

04:09.640 --> 04:17.520
And I started that when it was a one person show when I started a company two years ago.

04:17.520 --> 04:27.560
A small reminder, one person of income means 1000 euros for every 100,000 of income.

04:27.560 --> 04:33.680
The idea of one person is not a new one, you have probably seen about one person for the

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
planet.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.040
There have been a few initiatives of giving to open source but I think it's good to bring

04:40.040 --> 04:48.320
the idea back because we are always, as always, missing money in open source.

04:48.320 --> 05:14.040
Now when a company gives a donation, what it needs, invoice.

05:14.040 --> 05:24.760
I will shout it too much, I think.

05:24.760 --> 05:31.000
When you're running a company, you need an invoice for every single expense you have.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.280
And if you pay first and then wait for the invoice, you have a risk of not getting it

05:38.280 --> 05:43.240
at all or getting after a long time.

05:43.240 --> 05:50.720
Last year I have given to one of the organizations in open source, everyone here knows and I'm

05:50.720 --> 05:54.360
not going to name because.

05:54.360 --> 06:00.920
And it took me like four or five months of email exchanges with a person who was very

06:00.920 --> 06:05.120
sorry that they cannot get to the person doing the invoices, they cannot give me a invoice,

06:05.120 --> 06:09.840
they are going to send them a message yet again and I was a month again, I was sending

06:09.840 --> 06:12.320
the message again.

06:12.320 --> 06:16.200
Somebody got my voice like five months later.

06:16.200 --> 06:23.160
That is risky, I was already thinking how to explain that to my accountant.

06:23.160 --> 06:30.560
A company can go through a method used by big companies, purchase order that the company

06:30.560 --> 06:37.320
gives, then the recipient of the money gives the invoice and then you pay.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.560
Problem, it's a burden.

06:39.560 --> 06:44.600
It's a burden to the organization you give and it's a burden for the company giving the

06:44.600 --> 06:46.360
money.

06:46.360 --> 06:54.720
But that's the solution I use for bigger donations when I cannot risk of not getting the invoice.

06:54.720 --> 07:02.480
For individuals, they are all the ways to donate.

07:02.480 --> 07:08.000
If a company wants to give money to an individual, that's complicated.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.280
For the tax reasons, for the legal reasons, so we are avoiding giving money directly to

07:16.280 --> 07:18.720
individuals.

07:18.720 --> 07:26.560
For cryptocurrencies, some projects accept cryptocurrencies.

07:26.560 --> 07:38.840
I leave you the question to ask your accountant and then you need to be sure you can run away

07:38.840 --> 07:44.080
from the place.

07:44.080 --> 07:51.400
The reaction varies but may be drastic when you talk to accountant about cryptocurrencies.

07:51.400 --> 08:01.120
So no, if you do not want to run into trouble, you do not donate in cryptocurrencies when

08:01.120 --> 08:04.560
you are running a company.

08:04.560 --> 08:10.920
Now, typical open source organizations supporting projects, what they offer for companies?

08:10.920 --> 08:15.960
Either yearly sponsoring or even sponsoring.

08:15.960 --> 08:24.680
That is something that exists for most organizations, typically sponsoring is from 1000 to 25,000

08:24.680 --> 08:28.200
euros depending on the level.

08:28.200 --> 08:34.240
Even sponsoring is between 500 to around 10,000 euros.

08:34.240 --> 08:41.520
Now we compare that with what a small company can give.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.040
In a small company, I have an alternative.

08:44.040 --> 08:57.000
Either I give 1000 euros to one project eventually too or I give 100 euros to way more projects.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.160
For people who live in open source, we know that if I give to project X, someone will

09:03.160 --> 09:11.620
ask, but why you are not giving to project Y and Z and some more, right?

09:11.620 --> 09:17.880
Because if you are going to one project, it's fair to give to all others.

09:17.880 --> 09:24.160
Opinions differ inside the company who is using which project in their products.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.160
Exactly.

09:25.160 --> 09:36.280
At the end, what happens is you want to give smaller amounts to more projects.

09:36.280 --> 09:43.080
That is exactly not in line with what the organization supporting open source have as

09:43.080 --> 09:48.920
an offer.

09:48.920 --> 09:54.240
Our way of doing the donation is giving directly to organizations.

09:54.240 --> 10:00.520
We establish the way of how to do the payment.

10:00.520 --> 10:06.240
Either they have an account that you can create and then donate or you need to contact some

10:06.240 --> 10:11.240
email address and figure out the details.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.240
Things vary.

10:13.240 --> 10:21.160
Then when we have the method set up, we have that organization now, a database, and every

10:21.160 --> 10:27.000
transaction later, it goes the same way and it works.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.720
There are other ways using aggregators like GitHub sponsors, Open Source Collective, or

10:35.720 --> 10:38.040
Phoenix Foundation crowdfunding.

10:38.040 --> 10:43.600
And there has been a talk about the subject by Wolfgang at the Open Source Summit Europe

10:43.600 --> 10:45.040
last year.

10:45.040 --> 10:50.480
He had a pretty different approach because that was from the approach of a big company

10:50.480 --> 10:58.720
with more internal difficulties of having the donations done than we have in small companies,

10:58.720 --> 11:08.240
but still his analysis of the ways you can donate is pretty interesting.

11:08.240 --> 11:18.600
Now is it hard to donate to an open source project by a company?

11:18.600 --> 11:25.320
Financially the amount of money, one person, if you compare it to different expenses you

11:25.320 --> 11:36.000
have in a company, accounting, rent, internet access, electricity of whatever you have,

11:36.000 --> 11:42.240
it will be in the small things that you have on the company bill.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.440
So it's not really that hard to do.

11:46.440 --> 11:51.440
What is a little bit more complicated is the organization.

11:51.440 --> 12:00.720
And what I found out is most complex is actually deciding to which project you want to give,

12:00.720 --> 12:06.480
even in a company when everyone agrees, we want to give.

12:06.480 --> 12:12.040
A lot of discussions and decision making on how to do that.

12:12.040 --> 12:16.720
And then important thing, collect and document the payment procedure if you're not going

12:16.720 --> 12:19.560
through an aggregate.

12:19.560 --> 12:28.560
Now you have to ask why.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.920
Project work as they can.

12:33.920 --> 12:38.760
And when you are already doing open source you can say that you are already contributing

12:38.760 --> 12:45.920
and there's a kind of donation you are already doing.

12:45.920 --> 12:52.080
I would say that this is an addition to the work you are doing because you cannot take

12:52.080 --> 12:57.200
maintainership in every single project you are using in your product.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.160
That is just not possible.

12:59.160 --> 13:07.880
And this is the maintainers work, infrastructure, all those hard to sell us new features that

13:07.880 --> 13:11.880
need financing the most.

13:11.880 --> 13:16.800
In my opinion that works easiest with the money because you can just pay someone spending

13:16.800 --> 13:21.540
their time on doing those tasks.

13:21.540 --> 13:30.500
And then a subject related to the presentation before, currently quite many organizations

13:30.500 --> 13:41.600
I was involved with, they in reality depend on donation from a small number of big companies.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.820
Give a part of individual donations that they receive.

13:45.820 --> 13:54.120
So if you can break that dependency and make sure that those projects have more stable

13:54.120 --> 14:03.600
and more diversified way of getting the income, that is going to improve the stability and

14:03.600 --> 14:10.960
at the end is going to improve the quality of the code we all depend on.

14:10.960 --> 14:16.680
So are you ready to try it out in your company?

14:16.680 --> 14:25.000
Or do you have any questions, subjects for discussions?

14:25.000 --> 14:29.720
In the meantime we try to fix the microphone.

14:29.720 --> 14:37.720
So take a bit of time as a question then.

14:37.720 --> 14:46.120
What can open source projects do to make this easier?

14:46.120 --> 14:51.760
For example, something that I run a scientific open source project we are looking at trying

14:51.760 --> 14:55.880
to incorporate as a nonprofit because we think that will be more attractive and we are trying

14:55.880 --> 14:59.280
to figure out where to do that and deal with all of the international stuff.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.640
It's a whole thing.

15:01.640 --> 15:06.880
So I guess what do you see from the small business perspective as to what projects can

15:06.880 --> 15:18.200
do to make your giving us money easier?

15:18.200 --> 15:22.160
Maybe we collect some questions first and then in between we can fix the mic issue.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.520
Would it be fine for you?

15:25.520 --> 15:33.440
So that's why maybe we collect some questions?

15:33.440 --> 15:37.640
The question is how a project can make it easier.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.760
For me it's very simple.

15:40.760 --> 15:54.400
Have a legal entity that can create invoices or any legal proof of payment for the amount

15:54.400 --> 16:01.120
and make it easy for a company to do that.

16:01.120 --> 16:11.040
Make it easy in such a way that when you get a message that we want to give you 500 euros,

16:11.040 --> 16:22.040
we get a response rapidly that increases confidence that's going to work.

16:22.040 --> 16:33.160
And then you can, if you are ready to send an invoice just at the moment of payment,

16:33.160 --> 16:36.160
that helps.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.580
If you have a system that generates invoices it's even better.

16:40.580 --> 16:45.020
You can use online invoice generation systems that exist.

16:45.020 --> 16:48.080
If you can use it it's even easier for everyone.

16:48.080 --> 16:54.840
But it's really simple fast reaction time and getting the invoice easily.

16:54.840 --> 17:04.640
If I have those two I will be willing to donate again.

17:04.640 --> 17:10.480
So we have another question over here.

17:10.480 --> 17:16.680
So mainly the perspective on this was by a company's perspective.

17:16.680 --> 17:23.520
And this topic has been discussed by the technical committee just recently as I'm part of that.

17:23.520 --> 17:30.180
And Node.js is part of the foundation and money is actually not an issue.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.520
That's not the main problem.

17:31.520 --> 17:38.480
What we need is actually people donating their time and effort into projects.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.640
And that is way more valuable as such.

17:41.640 --> 17:47.320
So if a company instead of investing money because it's really difficult even for an

17:47.320 --> 17:51.480
organization you have to decide who's actually going to get that money.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.960
Do we pay someone?

17:52.960 --> 17:55.240
What is with the others who contributed?

17:55.240 --> 18:00.320
It's a really tough question to answer if it's not a single contributor to this open

18:00.320 --> 18:02.960
source project.

18:02.960 --> 18:11.520
And therefore if you pay someone from your company to work on that project that is mostly

18:11.520 --> 18:14.760
really really valuable.

18:14.760 --> 18:20.600
Thank you.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.520
That was a pretty important subject.

18:23.520 --> 18:31.760
In a situation where the money is not really an issue people are an issue.

18:31.760 --> 18:38.500
And my answer here will depend on the type of the development we are on.

18:38.500 --> 18:48.760
In my case for most of the projects we donate small amounts like 100 euros per year to 100

18:48.760 --> 18:49.760
euros per year.

18:49.760 --> 18:55.800
That amount of money doesn't allow you to hire anyone to work on the project.

18:55.800 --> 19:04.120
What would be possible would be to donate to an organization that will hire that person

19:04.120 --> 19:08.600
and have multiple companies donate to that person and then hire.

19:08.600 --> 19:17.200
Also hiring someone for a small company it's an important risk if you don't have funding.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.880
Hiring someone for me is more of an approach.

19:21.880 --> 19:25.560
Either you have a business model closely related with the project.

19:25.560 --> 19:31.400
If you are really doing money with that specific project then it makes sense.

19:31.400 --> 19:38.320
Or if you are a company of like 50 then you can probably allow that.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.200
For small companies I think it's a little bit more complicated unfortunately.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.960
We also try to...

19:46.960 --> 19:49.240
We have another question over there.

19:49.240 --> 19:53.160
I'd like to highlight a service by a small NGO from Berlin.

19:53.160 --> 19:58.940
It's called the Center for Cultivation of Technology which is like a back end to open

19:58.940 --> 20:03.760
source projects so they're registered non-profits in Berlin.

20:03.760 --> 20:11.960
If you are a small open source project which doesn't have a company somewhere or a legal

20:11.960 --> 20:17.240
name to yourself you can go there and say hey I'm an open source project and they could

20:17.240 --> 20:19.800
act as a trustee.

20:19.800 --> 20:26.920
They receive donations and they can hold that for your project so companies can get invoices

20:26.920 --> 20:34.120
or checks that the money has been sent there and the software devs don't have to care about

20:34.120 --> 20:36.800
all the financial stuff for that.

20:36.800 --> 20:41.720
So there is like a back end to support open source projects and to make invoicing more

20:41.720 --> 20:46.520
easier and at no cost.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.440
You want to respond to that?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.400
Just a comment.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.640
A small comment for that.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.360
Thank you for doing this.

20:53.360 --> 20:53.360
If you could send me details of the financial

20:55.360 --> 21:00.360
initiatives that allow that aggregating payments for different projects.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
Okay.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
Test one, two.

21:02.360 --> 21:09.360
My question is well I thank you for mentioning fiscal sponsorship organizations and I want

21:09.360 --> 21:20.360
to give a yes software freedom conservancy is a fiscal sponsor organization as well as

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
there are many others.

21:21.360 --> 21:27.680
I know that several of us are very interested in making sure that the projects we accept

21:27.680 --> 21:34.400
and therefore take donations for have great governance and so there can be trust as far

21:34.400 --> 21:39.920
as making sure that funds are donated or used for the project and are used wisely.

21:39.920 --> 21:48.120
How do you evaluate governance for these donations or do you not because there's smaller donations?

21:48.120 --> 21:50.800
I think we are trying to test.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
It's working.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
Okay.

21:52.800 --> 21:57.280
The question was how we evaluate that the money is going to be well spent.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.720
I'm taking a shortcut.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.320
We are donating to the projects we know very well.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.320
So that's easy.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.160
We know the governance.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.920
We know how they work.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.920
So the check is easy.

22:15.920 --> 22:23.920
Getting to projects that we know less I would definitely agree that getting to a project

22:23.920 --> 22:33.880
that is in some aggregator that has policies on the governments that's an additional plus

22:33.880 --> 22:41.200
something point for this project to actually donate it then to a project that we just absolutely

22:41.200 --> 22:42.920
do not know how they work.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.280
What's going to happen.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.960
The answer to an email after a month and things like that.

22:48.960 --> 22:54.000
That's definitely a bonus point for the projects to getting a donation.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Absolutely.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Okay.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.080
So we have another question over here.

23:00.080 --> 23:11.960
So coming back to what you said earlier, like at least when you're a computer company, then

23:11.960 --> 23:17.640
you can definitely let someone work at least part time on open source.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.840
That would be something really valuable again.

23:19.840 --> 23:25.200
I encourage people in my company that are working to work on open source and we have

23:25.200 --> 23:28.840
dedicated time that they may invest into that.

23:28.840 --> 23:36.760
And even as a small company, I was able to work on open source because we used open source

23:36.760 --> 23:43.080
and we ran into bugs, for example, while developing things and then I discussed that with the

23:43.080 --> 23:45.600
leadership at that point of time.

23:45.600 --> 23:50.480
Instead of having a workaround built into the application that we are currently building

23:50.480 --> 23:55.680
as a closed source, hey, why am I not going to fix that bug in that open source library

23:55.680 --> 23:57.320
that we are currently using?

23:57.320 --> 23:59.320
And that's what I did.

23:59.320 --> 24:07.280
One more, right?

24:07.280 --> 24:11.280
I think you have my mic.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
I have my mic.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.280
Sure.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.280
I completely agree.

24:15.280 --> 24:21.400
The money part for me is in addition to all the other open source work you do.

24:21.400 --> 24:29.160
We as an open source company, we propose to our customers to upstream they code that we

24:29.160 --> 24:34.040
tell them we can upstream the patches that you have, the fixes that you have.

24:34.040 --> 24:43.760
We can help you with working with the open source work for your project.

24:43.760 --> 24:48.960
The money part is in addition to that, if you are already open source citizen, that's

24:48.960 --> 24:50.760
already great.

24:50.760 --> 24:56.640
But what I found out is that quite many projects.

24:56.640 --> 25:03.120
I'm involved in York store, so that's I have a lot of experience in that.

25:03.120 --> 25:10.840
That's the maintenance part that requires time and convincing customers to have people

25:10.840 --> 25:13.120
working and maintainers.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.520
It's even a problem for the Linux kernel.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.080
So it's a bigger problem.

25:19.080 --> 25:25.560
And I think that without financing people separately from that, it's not really going

25:25.560 --> 25:26.560
to happen.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.480
It's already happened with different funding for different open source projects for the

25:30.480 --> 25:32.480
maintenance part.

25:32.480 --> 25:37.720
And if you can go forward with that, that's going to help.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.720
Time's up.

25:39.720 --> 25:57.280
I'm happy to discuss with all of you in the corridors.
