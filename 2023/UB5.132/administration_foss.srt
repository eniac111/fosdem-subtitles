0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.560
Happy to introduce our next speaker, Klaus Wieckenhott.

2
0:00:09.560 --> 0:00:19.360
Yeah, thank you and welcome to my talk.

3
0:00:19.360 --> 0:00:24.600
Actually today I'm here representing the Open Source Business Alliance, so the OSPR.

4
0:00:24.600 --> 0:00:30.920
We are a non-profit organization representing more than 200 companies in Germany trying

5
0:00:30.920 --> 0:00:37.400
to make money with open source software and also the goal of the OSPR is to promote usage

6
0:00:37.400 --> 0:00:39.200
of open source software.

7
0:00:39.200 --> 0:00:44.360
So we have some heavyweight members like Susie, Red Hat or Telecom but also smaller companies

8
0:00:44.360 --> 0:00:47.600
like Linu Data whom I'm working for.

9
0:00:47.600 --> 0:00:53.880
And within the OSPR we have several working groups and I'm the spokesman of the working

10
0:00:53.880 --> 0:00:57.080
group Berschaftung that means procurement.

11
0:00:57.080 --> 0:01:03.440
And so we are busy or we were busy the last year with negotiations with people working

12
0:01:03.440 --> 0:01:08.680
on this sector and I want to share a bit all the experiences, all the insights I found

13
0:01:08.680 --> 0:01:16.280
personally because I think it's very interesting to see the other side of the table when we're

14
0:01:16.280 --> 0:01:18.280
talking with people about that.

15
0:01:18.280 --> 0:01:21.440
I have said in disclaimer, so this is no legal advice.

16
0:01:21.440 --> 0:01:27.640
I have an engineers degree, I'm more kind of a developer and I just came a bit by accident

17
0:01:27.640 --> 0:01:30.520
into this world.

18
0:01:30.520 --> 0:01:32.720
So this is no legal advice.

19
0:01:32.720 --> 0:01:40.460
If you have legal issues, especially license issues, you need to go and get a lawyer.

20
0:01:40.460 --> 0:01:51.260
So why is all this getting more important on part of the public sector side?

21
0:01:51.260 --> 0:01:56.200
So we know that the world is changing sometimes in different ways we don't expect.

22
0:01:56.200 --> 0:02:01.880
I remember the last Fostem before Corona and then just a few weeks later the streets were

23
0:02:01.880 --> 0:02:04.320
empty because there was the lockdown.

24
0:02:04.320 --> 0:02:06.840
Then we had a Fostem completely virtually.

25
0:02:06.840 --> 0:02:10.920
That was very strange because you were sitting relaxed with coffee and everything at home

26
0:02:10.920 --> 0:02:14.600
but you're missing the atmosphere, people aren't there.

27
0:02:14.600 --> 0:02:19.760
We had Ever Given got stuck in the Suez channel so we are running out of supplies with IT

28
0:02:19.760 --> 0:02:21.640
hardware and all these things.

29
0:02:21.640 --> 0:02:26.120
Now we have a war on the eastern part of Europe and it all leads to something that we call

30
0:02:26.120 --> 0:02:31.560
sovereignty, especially digital sovereignty and this is something that the countries really

31
0:02:31.560 --> 0:02:38.540
now understand themselves so they see that they have to be able to react on things and

32
0:02:38.540 --> 0:02:42.240
that to handle on their own will.

33
0:02:42.240 --> 0:02:45.840
So in the actual coalition agreement from the German federal government, there's something

34
0:02:45.840 --> 0:02:48.860
stated, it's in German but I translated it for you.

35
0:02:48.860 --> 0:02:52.440
So developments are usually commissioned as open source and the corresponding software

36
0:02:52.440 --> 0:02:54.640
is generally made public.

37
0:02:54.640 --> 0:03:00.560
And there are many more initiatives in German counties and cities that are focusing on building

38
0:03:00.560 --> 0:03:02.400
on open source technology.

39
0:03:02.400 --> 0:03:04.320
I'm pretty sure it's the same all over Europe.

40
0:03:04.320 --> 0:03:09.320
We have a context to France, to Luxembourg where all these things also happen in a similar

41
0:03:09.320 --> 0:03:12.640
way.

42
0:03:12.640 --> 0:03:20.120
So far so good, it's quite hard to get an understanding on how the number of used open

43
0:03:20.120 --> 0:03:21.960
source software evolves.

44
0:03:21.960 --> 0:03:25.680
So the main principle in our open source software is that we share it with everybody.

45
0:03:25.680 --> 0:03:30.280
So I cannot check somewhere how many installations there are.

46
0:03:30.280 --> 0:03:34.440
You can sometimes figure out in server logs what kind of clients are connecting.

47
0:03:34.440 --> 0:03:38.560
You can check download numbers from GitHub, GitLab and whatever but you don't see a real

48
0:03:38.560 --> 0:03:41.600
number.

49
0:03:41.600 --> 0:03:48.400
So at OSPR we didn't survive on our member companies dealing with selling open source

50
0:03:48.400 --> 0:03:54.640
to the public sector and asking a bit about the issues they face and the question that

51
0:03:54.640 --> 0:03:55.640
arrived.

52
0:03:55.640 --> 0:03:59.920
And we also did monthly workshops with the minister in Germany that's responsible for

53
0:03:59.920 --> 0:04:01.840
some of these contracts.

54
0:04:01.840 --> 0:04:05.920
And then we got some pretty interesting insight about the issues they have.

55
0:04:05.920 --> 0:04:11.000
And the result is the open source licenses we use and the contract management on the

56
0:04:11.000 --> 0:04:12.000
public sector side.

57
0:04:12.000 --> 0:04:14.040
They are not really friends.

58
0:04:14.040 --> 0:04:19.000
So there are some problems that we need to solve, that we need to address and there's

59
0:04:19.000 --> 0:04:20.560
really room for improvement.

60
0:04:20.560 --> 0:04:24.040
And I want to point out some of these things here.

61
0:04:24.040 --> 0:04:27.080
So the power of open source is something that I don't have to explain to you.

62
0:04:27.080 --> 0:04:34.100
These are the four freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation stated in the GPL.

63
0:04:34.100 --> 0:04:36.360
We all know that probably by heart.

64
0:04:36.360 --> 0:04:41.700
And this is the base of all our work, let's say.

65
0:04:41.700 --> 0:04:45.740
But this power of open source, they come with a price tag.

66
0:04:45.740 --> 0:04:52.340
And this is something I didn't know before I was really looking into these issues.

67
0:04:52.340 --> 0:04:59.680
Because you get all these freedoms for the, if you apply to the terms and conditions.

68
0:04:59.680 --> 0:05:04.480
And I took it here from the GPL to O. You may copy and redistribute verbatim copies

69
0:05:04.480 --> 0:05:07.320
of the program's source code as you receive it.

70
0:05:07.320 --> 0:05:13.760
And any medium provided that you conspiciously and appropriately publish on each copy an

71
0:05:13.760 --> 0:05:16.880
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer warranty.

72
0:05:16.880 --> 0:05:22.960
Keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty.

73
0:05:22.960 --> 0:05:30.040
And give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program.

74
0:05:30.040 --> 0:05:35.540
These terms and conditions mainly apply in the case of distribution of software.

75
0:05:35.540 --> 0:05:39.360
So this is something that is not very common in a business to business situation.

76
0:05:39.360 --> 0:05:44.600
So if the company is buying software, they just want to keep it for themselves.

77
0:05:44.600 --> 0:05:46.460
They're producing cars or they are bakeries.

78
0:05:46.460 --> 0:05:48.900
So then they're not going to distribute the software.

79
0:05:48.900 --> 0:05:51.620
So there is no problem.

80
0:05:51.620 --> 0:05:56.140
But if you go business to government, you most often have the situation that the government

81
0:05:56.140 --> 0:06:01.240
itself is a huge complex body of several legal entities.

82
0:06:01.240 --> 0:06:05.760
And then one entity is getting, is organizing the software.

83
0:06:05.760 --> 0:06:08.720
And then they have to distribute it to the other parts.

84
0:06:08.720 --> 0:06:11.960
And then this distribution fact applies here.

85
0:06:11.960 --> 0:06:16.520
And then they have to check if they apply on the licenses.

86
0:06:16.520 --> 0:06:21.120
And they have to check that everything is complete and everything of these conditions

87
0:06:21.120 --> 0:06:22.400
are fulfilled.

88
0:06:22.400 --> 0:06:23.700
So these are legal issues.

89
0:06:23.700 --> 0:06:25.700
So they need lawyers to work on that.

90
0:06:25.700 --> 0:06:28.880
And this costs money, resources.

91
0:06:28.880 --> 0:06:33.840
Another thing that we face is that these licenses we are using are mainly in English available.

92
0:06:33.840 --> 0:06:38.960
So there's only an English version, which is quite hard in Germany because you need

93
0:06:38.960 --> 0:06:41.440
a translation into proper German.

94
0:06:41.440 --> 0:06:45.080
But there is no authorized version of the GPL, for example.

95
0:06:45.080 --> 0:06:47.960
And they are all based on US conception of law.

96
0:06:47.960 --> 0:06:52.680
So for example, this copyright thing we have in Germany is completely different in the

97
0:06:52.680 --> 0:06:53.740
US.

98
0:06:53.740 --> 0:06:58.440
So you need lawyers to put that into the right thing.

99
0:06:58.440 --> 0:07:00.480
I'm not going to say they are not working.

100
0:07:00.480 --> 0:07:06.120
So we have several projects like GPLviolation.org.

101
0:07:06.120 --> 0:07:11.400
They showed in Germany by going to court that the licenses work and people understand them.

102
0:07:11.400 --> 0:07:16.080
But it's quite hard to use them.

103
0:07:16.080 --> 0:07:22.080
So in Germany, mainly the software is ordered via tenders.

104
0:07:22.080 --> 0:07:24.320
This is regulated in a procurement law.

105
0:07:24.320 --> 0:07:26.240
And there is something like the E4BIT.

106
0:07:26.240 --> 0:07:28.320
That means the against in the E4BIT.

107
0:07:28.320 --> 0:07:47.120
So B

108
0:07:47.120 --> 0:07:57.180
is

109
0:07:57.180 --> 0:08:03.680
in

110
0:08:03.680 --> 0:08:07.000
negotiation necessary to solve these issues.

111
0:08:07.000 --> 0:08:09.460
And this is also some extra work,

112
0:08:09.460 --> 0:08:12.720
something of the price tag I was talking about.

113
0:08:16.200 --> 0:08:17.040
You're here in Belgium,

114
0:08:17.040 --> 0:08:19.260
and Belgium is famous for its comic strips,

115
0:08:19.260 --> 0:08:22.400
so I found this one that I really, really like.

116
0:08:22.400 --> 0:08:25.080
It shows a modern application, any application,

117
0:08:25.080 --> 0:08:27.800
probably one of the app store from the talk before.

118
0:08:27.800 --> 0:08:29.980
And you see it's very shiny, complex,

119
0:08:29.980 --> 0:08:32.260
and very detailed model,

120
0:08:32.260 --> 0:08:33.760
but it's a kind of a building blocks.

121
0:08:33.760 --> 0:08:34.940
This is the way we work.

122
0:08:34.940 --> 0:08:39.020
So we use open source blocks somewhere outside,

123
0:08:39.020 --> 0:08:41.220
and we recombine them to something new.

124
0:08:42.240 --> 0:08:44.360
And the thing is,

125
0:08:44.360 --> 0:08:47.900
each of these components has its own license.

126
0:08:48.920 --> 0:08:53.880
And the problem here is that we cannot say

127
0:08:53.880 --> 0:08:57.400
there is a final license for our whole product,

128
0:08:57.400 --> 0:08:59.320
because when we distribute the software,

129
0:08:59.320 --> 0:09:02.440
we distribute all the small packages together.

130
0:09:02.440 --> 0:09:05.160
And at OSB-ABI also did an examination

131
0:09:05.160 --> 0:09:07.720
of a popular video chat solution,

132
0:09:07.720 --> 0:09:09.960
the beginning of COVID, we all needed that.

133
0:09:09.960 --> 0:09:13.980
I'm not gonna name it, but on the project side,

134
0:09:13.980 --> 0:09:16.120
it says it used the LGPL,

135
0:09:16.120 --> 0:09:19.160
so the GNU Lesson public license.

136
0:09:19.160 --> 0:09:21.000
And when you install that on your hard disk,

137
0:09:21.000 --> 0:09:23.640
and you try to examine all the files installed there,

138
0:09:23.640 --> 0:09:25.960
and figure out all the different license files

139
0:09:25.960 --> 0:09:27.400
that we're putting on your hard disk,

140
0:09:27.400 --> 0:09:29.560
you find that it's not LGPL,

141
0:09:29.560 --> 0:09:32.840
it's a mixture of different things.

142
0:09:32.840 --> 0:09:34.640
And this tools also the installer

143
0:09:34.640 --> 0:09:36.520
downloads fonts from Microsoft.

144
0:09:36.520 --> 0:09:40.380
So they have some specific true type fonts.

145
0:09:40.380 --> 0:09:44.720
And in Debian, you can download an installer for those,

146
0:09:44.720 --> 0:09:46.040
then you call the installer,

147
0:09:46.040 --> 0:09:48.880
and then you have to apply to the Euler from Microsoft,

148
0:09:48.880 --> 0:09:50.520
and then the download starts.

149
0:09:50.520 --> 0:09:51.480
But here nothing happened,

150
0:09:51.480 --> 0:09:53.820
it just appear on your hard disk.

151
0:09:53.820 --> 0:09:56.220
So this is something that you have take care,

152
0:09:56.220 --> 0:09:59.460
when dealing with this software.

153
0:09:59.460 --> 0:10:00.940
And this is something,

154
0:10:00.940 --> 0:10:02.420
when we think back to the public sector,

155
0:10:02.420 --> 0:10:05.160
they distributed to another legal entity within.

156
0:10:05.160 --> 0:10:08.300
So now they have to fulfill all these license things

157
0:10:08.300 --> 0:10:10.340
that are putting in that product.

158
0:10:11.780 --> 0:10:14.100
The main question I cannot answer here is,

159
0:10:14.100 --> 0:10:16.020
who is responsible for that?

160
0:10:16.020 --> 0:10:18.980
The project that put the installer on their project page,

161
0:10:18.980 --> 0:10:22.980
the programmer or the developer that made that installer,

162
0:10:22.980 --> 0:10:25.380
probably the company that made the offer,

163
0:10:25.380 --> 0:10:26.980
and made the installation work,

164
0:10:26.980 --> 0:10:31.020
or the admin guy on host server it's running,

165
0:10:31.020 --> 0:10:33.060
or at least later the final entity

166
0:10:33.060 --> 0:10:35.500
that is using this application.

167
0:10:35.500 --> 0:10:37.280
So this is a kind of an issue.

168
0:10:37.280 --> 0:10:39.820
And be sure with containers, the things are getting worse,

169
0:10:39.820 --> 0:10:41.580
because then you get a bunch of containers,

170
0:10:41.580 --> 0:10:43.500
everything with his own operating system,

171
0:10:43.500 --> 0:10:45.340
and also a different bunch of software,

172
0:10:45.340 --> 0:10:47.780
and a different bunch of licenses integrated.

173
0:10:49.860 --> 0:10:52.100
So we need to answer the question,

174
0:10:52.100 --> 0:10:54.900
when we look on a piece of software, what is inside?

175
0:10:54.900 --> 0:10:58.700
Which licenses are used inside?

176
0:10:58.700 --> 0:11:00.820
And then we come to something like a package insert,

177
0:11:00.820 --> 0:11:05.620
like for medicine, and the only way to deal with that

178
0:11:05.620 --> 0:11:08.700
is an S-bomb, the software bill of materials.

179
0:11:08.700 --> 0:11:10.980
And this should list all the components,

180
0:11:10.980 --> 0:11:13.380
all libraries, all modules, all container stuff,

181
0:11:13.380 --> 0:11:16.060
everything that's put into your product.

182
0:11:16.060 --> 0:11:20.420
And for the S-bomb, we need the information about,

183
0:11:20.420 --> 0:11:23.060
yeah, the piece of program, the source,

184
0:11:23.060 --> 0:11:24.740
where does it come from?

185
0:11:24.740 --> 0:11:27.180
The version and the license.

186
0:11:28.460 --> 0:11:30.740
With the version and the source,

187
0:11:30.740 --> 0:11:33.340
we can also answer security questions,

188
0:11:33.340 --> 0:11:35.620
like are we vulnerable for something?

189
0:11:35.620 --> 0:11:39.340
Lock4j, for example, is somewhere Lock4j implemented,

190
0:11:39.340 --> 0:11:41.660
which version do we have to fix that?

191
0:11:41.660 --> 0:11:43.940
And for us, for our legal view on that,

192
0:11:43.940 --> 0:11:47.700
we know which licenses are there.

193
0:11:47.700 --> 0:11:51.100
But when we have this bunch of licenses,

194
0:11:51.100 --> 0:11:54.360
we are not really done as public sector,

195
0:11:54.360 --> 0:11:57.100
because now we have to check for our business case.

196
0:11:58.820 --> 0:12:00.300
Are all these license compatible?

197
0:12:00.300 --> 0:12:01.460
Are they working together?

198
0:12:01.460 --> 0:12:04.620
We have something like copy left that might have an impact.

199
0:12:04.620 --> 0:12:06.500
So we have to figure out that situation

200
0:12:06.500 --> 0:12:08.220
for a specific business case.

201
0:12:08.220 --> 0:12:10.260
So we still need some people

202
0:12:10.260 --> 0:12:13.260
dealing with license compliance stuff.

203
0:12:13.260 --> 0:12:14.220
For the S-bomb itself,

204
0:12:14.220 --> 0:12:16.620
there are different formats available outside.

205
0:12:17.820 --> 0:12:21.980
The one that's mainly seems to be the most common use

206
0:12:21.980 --> 0:12:26.420
so far is the SPDX format, Software Package Data Exchange.

207
0:12:26.420 --> 0:12:28.980
It's maintained by the Linux Foundation,

208
0:12:28.980 --> 0:12:32.140
and it's the only one that is an ISO certification now.

209
0:12:32.140 --> 0:12:34.500
So this is something that's an ISO standard,

210
0:12:34.500 --> 0:12:37.220
and then we can use that.

211
0:12:37.220 --> 0:12:38.500
There are tools available out there

212
0:12:38.500 --> 0:12:42.220
to convert S-bomb from one format to another.

213
0:12:42.220 --> 0:12:44.300
That's mainly text files in different formats,

214
0:12:44.300 --> 0:12:46.020
JSON, for example.

215
0:12:46.020 --> 0:12:51.020
And yeah, with that, we get a detailed view

216
0:12:51.020 --> 0:12:56.020
on all the components that's inside our software delivery.

217
0:12:56.060 --> 0:12:57.940
And for people who are being interested

218
0:12:57.940 --> 0:13:00.380
or being a bit afraid,

219
0:13:00.380 --> 0:13:02.880
oh, I have to deliver an S-bomb.

220
0:13:02.880 --> 0:13:06.060
Tomorrow there's a whole death room here on Fosten,

221
0:13:06.060 --> 0:13:09.900
just dealing with this S-bomb topic.

222
0:13:09.900 --> 0:13:13.060
So this is something we will probably face in future

223
0:13:13.060 --> 0:13:15.820
when we apply for software tenders

224
0:13:15.820 --> 0:13:20.820
that we have to deliver an S-bomb with our solution.

225
0:13:21.780 --> 0:13:23.540
When we check all those licenses

226
0:13:23.540 --> 0:13:26.140
that may be around in the world,

227
0:13:26.140 --> 0:13:29.740
we come to a number of probably 1,800 different licenses

228
0:13:29.740 --> 0:13:31.540
that may appear in such an S-bomb.

229
0:13:31.540 --> 0:13:34.860
So we have 1,800 different legal texts

230
0:13:34.860 --> 0:13:37.380
that we might have to examine.

231
0:13:38.460 --> 0:13:43.220
Ozi has certified 116 of these as being open source.

232
0:13:43.220 --> 0:13:46.460
From my personal point of view, this list is incomplete.

233
0:13:46.460 --> 0:13:50.860
So Ozi has set up a kind of a lifecycle thing

234
0:13:50.860 --> 0:13:55.860
to get rid of licenses that are not common anymore.

235
0:13:57.100 --> 0:13:59.700
So to narrow down this number,

236
0:13:59.700 --> 0:14:03.260
so there are probably 500 that may be something

237
0:14:03.260 --> 0:14:05.220
like we would accept as open source.

238
0:14:06.740 --> 0:14:10.560
And each of them are different.

239
0:14:10.560 --> 0:14:13.660
So when you're working as a lawyer

240
0:14:13.660 --> 0:14:15.540
and you have to check the license situation,

241
0:14:15.540 --> 0:14:18.180
you have to deal with these number of licenses.

242
0:14:18.180 --> 0:14:20.060
But I want to remember you that also

243
0:14:20.060 --> 0:14:25.060
the proprietary software uses licenses and OILAs

244
0:14:25.940 --> 0:14:28.860
and they are mainly much more complex

245
0:14:28.860 --> 0:14:30.920
than our open source licenses.

246
0:14:30.920 --> 0:14:34.540
They are sometimes specific for a specific product

247
0:14:34.540 --> 0:14:35.940
and they are changed regularly.

248
0:14:35.940 --> 0:14:39.100
So if you use any device, sometimes it pops up,

249
0:14:39.100 --> 0:14:41.020
and you OILA, you have to accept it.

250
0:14:41.020 --> 0:14:43.260
And I'm pretty sure everybody here in the room

251
0:14:43.260 --> 0:14:46.100
checks them carefully, find out the differences

252
0:14:46.100 --> 0:14:48.740
to the last version because they are not kind of red

253
0:14:48.740 --> 0:14:52.160
or blue marked, and accept them afterwards.

254
0:14:53.260 --> 0:14:55.680
With open source, we have the real advantage,

255
0:14:55.680 --> 0:14:58.140
the unknown or hidden advantage I called it.

256
0:14:58.140 --> 0:15:01.500
We have the real advantage that our licenses are quite short.

257
0:15:01.500 --> 0:15:04.380
So they are mainly just a couple of pages,

258
0:15:04.380 --> 0:15:08.860
sometimes even not that, I think MIT is something

259
0:15:08.860 --> 0:15:11.620
like just a few lines of license code.

260
0:15:11.620 --> 0:15:14.980
And most of them follow a specific pattern.

261
0:15:14.980 --> 0:15:17.420
So they are derived from each other.

262
0:15:17.420 --> 0:15:20.260
And so you can find a structure inside

263
0:15:20.260 --> 0:15:25.060
and you get a better feeling for what this license is about.

264
0:15:25.060 --> 0:15:26.640
And they are pretty static.

265
0:15:27.580 --> 0:15:29.940
I mentioned the GPL2.0 before,

266
0:15:29.940 --> 0:15:33.060
that's the license applied onto the Linux kernel.

267
0:15:33.060 --> 0:15:37.460
And the GPL2.0 is unchanged since June 1991.

268
0:15:37.460 --> 0:15:42.220
So more than 30 years, the same license text.

269
0:15:42.220 --> 0:15:45.060
If I'm working as a lawyer, I'm pretty fine.

270
0:15:45.060 --> 0:15:47.940
I spend one time all my work in that license.

271
0:15:47.940 --> 0:15:49.420
And then the next 30 years,

272
0:15:49.420 --> 0:15:54.020
I can work with my customers and support them.

273
0:15:57.660 --> 0:16:01.220
What you also have seen while talking with people

274
0:16:01.220 --> 0:16:03.640
in the public sector that there are some kind of

275
0:16:03.640 --> 0:16:06.540
misconceptions outside.

276
0:16:06.540 --> 0:16:09.140
So this is a kind of misunderstandings

277
0:16:09.140 --> 0:16:12.400
that probably people talk, told them.

278
0:16:12.400 --> 0:16:15.660
And the first one is there is some people think

279
0:16:15.660 --> 0:16:18.660
there's an obligation to publish everything on the internet.

280
0:16:19.660 --> 0:16:21.820
But this is not written in any license.

281
0:16:21.820 --> 0:16:25.020
The idea of open source is you give somebody

282
0:16:25.020 --> 0:16:27.260
binary piece of software,

283
0:16:27.260 --> 0:16:29.060
and then you have to give him the source code

284
0:16:29.060 --> 0:16:30.320
of that software.

285
0:16:30.320 --> 0:16:34.580
So if something in the recipient environment changes,

286
0:16:34.580 --> 0:16:37.980
he can adapt the software on his needs.

287
0:16:37.980 --> 0:16:41.380
He can add new device drivers, he can change the language,

288
0:16:41.380 --> 0:16:43.480
he can add new functionality, whatever.

289
0:16:44.660 --> 0:16:47.260
But the thing is, you have to hand over the source code

290
0:16:47.260 --> 0:16:50.340
with appropriate rights to work on the source code

291
0:16:50.340 --> 0:16:52.660
to the recipient of a software.

292
0:16:52.660 --> 0:16:55.100
Not to anybody somewhere in the world.

293
0:16:55.100 --> 0:16:56.820
This is something most of us do

294
0:16:56.820 --> 0:16:58.500
because we want to spread our idea,

295
0:16:58.500 --> 0:17:03.100
we want to spread our software, but we don't have to.

296
0:17:03.100 --> 0:17:06.220
This is something important when you go on this,

297
0:17:06.220 --> 0:17:09.300
I think we have another talk today in the military sector,

298
0:17:09.300 --> 0:17:11.980
where probably parts of the solution must be hidden

299
0:17:11.980 --> 0:17:15.220
or must be not being published.

300
0:17:15.220 --> 0:17:17.940
Then you can easily use open source, you can adapt it,

301
0:17:17.940 --> 0:17:20.200
you can give it to another legal entity,

302
0:17:20.200 --> 0:17:22.740
but only they have to receive the source code.

303
0:17:22.740 --> 0:17:24.860
You don't have to put a mission control system

304
0:17:24.860 --> 0:17:25.740
on the internet.

305
0:17:26.900 --> 0:17:29.260
But some people are thinking like, this is open source,

306
0:17:29.260 --> 0:17:31.140
I have to publish everything.

307
0:17:31.140 --> 0:17:32.860
Another thing is like pushing changes back

308
0:17:32.860 --> 0:17:33.740
to the community.

309
0:17:33.740 --> 0:17:35.300
I personally really like that idea

310
0:17:35.300 --> 0:17:38.380
because then I'm not in charge anymore for my changes

311
0:17:38.380 --> 0:17:40.260
because the community does.

312
0:17:40.260 --> 0:17:42.380
Otherwise, with every updated version,

313
0:17:42.380 --> 0:17:44.700
I have to apply my changes again.

314
0:17:44.700 --> 0:17:47.780
But in fact, it's not stated in any license.

315
0:17:47.780 --> 0:17:49.540
It's more like common sense that we do so,

316
0:17:49.540 --> 0:17:51.540
but we don't have to bring the changes back

317
0:17:51.540 --> 0:17:52.380
to the community.

318
0:17:52.380 --> 0:17:55.020
This is something like mission control system,

319
0:17:55.020 --> 0:17:57.860
missile control system, whatever, we don't have to.

320
0:17:59.020 --> 0:18:01.540
And then we have, especially with copy left,

321
0:18:01.540 --> 0:18:05.700
sometimes the idea of the disclosure of all our source code.

322
0:18:05.700 --> 0:18:08.700
I think it's based in some Microsoft advertisements

323
0:18:08.700 --> 0:18:11.540
from 20 years ago during this Halloween papers,

324
0:18:11.540 --> 0:18:14.740
like all GPL, this kind of cancer.

325
0:18:14.740 --> 0:18:16.180
Distill is in their heads.

326
0:18:16.180 --> 0:18:19.660
No, we don't have to disclose all our source code.

327
0:18:19.660 --> 0:18:23.900
If we accidentally mix GPL into our product,

328
0:18:25.180 --> 0:18:27.460
we break the license.

329
0:18:27.460 --> 0:18:30.080
So we are not licensed anymore.

330
0:18:30.080 --> 0:18:32.400
So we cannot ship that solution.

331
0:18:32.400 --> 0:18:34.840
That's a legal problem we have to solve.

332
0:18:34.840 --> 0:18:37.080
But this is not that we, in this moment,

333
0:18:37.080 --> 0:18:39.200
we have to ship all our source code.

334
0:18:40.380 --> 0:18:43.160
So these are things that we hear.

335
0:18:43.160 --> 0:18:44.780
And then you'll think like, oh shit,

336
0:18:44.780 --> 0:18:47.660
we have to explain them that this is not the case.

337
0:18:47.660 --> 0:18:50.760
It's just normal software that we are dealing with.

338
0:18:53.300 --> 0:18:56.260
And then finally, my last slide,

339
0:18:56.260 --> 0:19:00.700
how can a developer improve the situation?

340
0:19:00.700 --> 0:19:03.420
So I said I'm also more a developer guide

341
0:19:03.420 --> 0:19:05.180
and an illegal guide.

342
0:19:05.180 --> 0:19:08.260
What we can do is when we start writing code,

343
0:19:08.260 --> 0:19:10.180
I mean, I wrote already better before,

344
0:19:10.180 --> 0:19:13.100
but normally you start just coding.

345
0:19:13.100 --> 0:19:16.780
When you start working on a new project,

346
0:19:16.780 --> 0:19:20.060
you should check the licenses of all the components

347
0:19:20.060 --> 0:19:22.540
you wanna use for compatibility.

348
0:19:22.540 --> 0:19:23.700
Do we have copy left?

349
0:19:23.700 --> 0:19:26.620
Does that all work and fit together what we are doing?

350
0:19:26.620 --> 0:19:28.260
And also in the planned business case

351
0:19:28.260 --> 0:19:30.220
that the company I'm working for,

352
0:19:30.220 --> 0:19:35.220
or the client I'm working for is going to use.

353
0:19:35.620 --> 0:19:37.180
Especially for standard components,

354
0:19:37.180 --> 0:19:39.140
when you think of that picture I showed you before,

355
0:19:39.140 --> 0:19:43.980
this strip thing, there was one small block

356
0:19:43.980 --> 0:19:44.980
on the right-hand side.

357
0:19:44.980 --> 0:19:47.940
If this breaks, it all falls apart.

358
0:19:48.820 --> 0:19:51.300
And this seems to be a very fundamental piece

359
0:19:51.300 --> 0:19:53.980
of that solution.

360
0:19:53.980 --> 0:19:56.700
So it's probably not that easy to change.

361
0:19:59.020 --> 0:20:02.620
We should think of, we shouldn't think.

362
0:20:02.620 --> 0:20:04.220
We should start building S-bombs

363
0:20:04.220 --> 0:20:07.460
so to check what's inside in our product.

364
0:20:07.460 --> 0:20:10.840
That's also something that the security guys are asking.

365
0:20:11.820 --> 0:20:13.780
And in the US there is something like

366
0:20:13.780 --> 0:20:18.220
the supply chain thing.

367
0:20:18.220 --> 0:20:22.140
There was a presidential advice

368
0:20:22.140 --> 0:20:24.500
on how to secure the digital supply chain.

369
0:20:24.500 --> 0:20:28.020
And S-bomb is a very, very important part in that.

370
0:20:28.020 --> 0:20:33.020
So I personally assume that we have to deliver S-bombs

371
0:20:33.660 --> 0:20:35.540
in public sector projects,

372
0:20:35.540 --> 0:20:38.780
and that developers are starting building S-bombs.

373
0:20:38.780 --> 0:20:41.180
And when you think of that picture I showed you,

374
0:20:41.180 --> 0:20:44.860
when every community of these building blocks

375
0:20:44.860 --> 0:20:47.020
made an S-bomb for their product,

376
0:20:47.020 --> 0:20:49.660
we can iteratively use all these S-bombs

377
0:20:49.660 --> 0:20:51.540
together for the final product.

378
0:20:51.540 --> 0:20:54.540
So this is something that will probably start to work

379
0:20:54.540 --> 0:20:57.640
from automatically, I think.

380
0:20:57.640 --> 0:21:00.580
But you should for your own project start writing S-bombs.

381
0:21:00.580 --> 0:21:03.420
And the best way is to build that into your build process

382
0:21:03.420 --> 0:21:05.900
so that it's created automatically.

383
0:21:05.900 --> 0:21:08.300
And update it with every update that you ship

384
0:21:08.300 --> 0:21:10.900
so that you always have a fresh S-bomb.

385
0:21:10.900 --> 0:21:12.900
I told you there is the license,

386
0:21:12.900 --> 0:21:15.140
the software version included.

387
0:21:15.140 --> 0:21:19.300
So you have to use that for dealing with security issues.

388
0:21:21.060 --> 0:21:23.400
Avoid exotic licenses.

389
0:21:23.400 --> 0:21:25.620
There are some interesting licenses around,

390
0:21:25.620 --> 0:21:28.240
for example, like the beer license.

391
0:21:28.240 --> 0:21:30.060
It's probably not a very good idea

392
0:21:30.060 --> 0:21:34.980
to try to find a very exotic license that nobody else uses

393
0:21:34.980 --> 0:21:37.580
because it makes the work for the lawyers

394
0:21:37.580 --> 0:21:39.700
much more complicated.

395
0:21:39.700 --> 0:21:43.220
And at the end, when you apply for such a tender,

396
0:21:43.220 --> 0:21:45.340
then it's not a specific solution

397
0:21:45.340 --> 0:21:46.900
that must be built in open source,

398
0:21:46.900 --> 0:21:50.460
but it's a tender for any software solution.

399
0:21:50.460 --> 0:21:56.700
And you are just one person offering an open source

400
0:21:56.700 --> 0:21:59.220
solution against proprietary solutions.

401
0:21:59.220 --> 0:22:02.340
They have to check what kind of work do we have afterwards.

402
0:22:02.340 --> 0:22:03.740
Does it fulfill our needs?

403
0:22:03.740 --> 0:22:05.300
And then they make a choice.

404
0:22:05.300 --> 0:22:07.620
And when your thing is way too complex

405
0:22:07.620 --> 0:22:10.460
and they are mainly working lawyers on that level,

406
0:22:10.460 --> 0:22:13.820
then probably they choose something else.

407
0:22:13.820 --> 0:22:16.820
I put in brackets, avoid if possible,

408
0:22:16.820 --> 0:22:19.020
try to reduce the pile of different use license.

409
0:22:19.020 --> 0:22:22.660
I know this is very hard because you cannot change

410
0:22:22.660 --> 0:22:25.180
the licenses of all the pieces that you need.

411
0:22:25.180 --> 0:22:28.580
But going back to OSE, I said they treat 116

412
0:22:28.580 --> 0:22:29.760
as open source licenses.

413
0:22:29.760 --> 0:22:32.500
They already started to narrow down their number of licenses

414
0:22:32.500 --> 0:22:33.940
they put on their website.

415
0:22:33.940 --> 0:22:36.460
And on their website, they have, I think, five popular licenses

416
0:22:36.460 --> 0:22:37.740
that they recommend.

417
0:22:37.740 --> 0:22:39.660
So this is something that you can probably

418
0:22:39.660 --> 0:22:42.260
try to follow.

419
0:22:42.260 --> 0:22:44.820
And the last thing is a question to you.

420
0:22:44.820 --> 0:22:46.460
Do you know the EUPL?

421
0:22:46.460 --> 0:22:49.300
That's the European Union Public License.

422
0:22:49.300 --> 0:22:51.260
It's a copy left license.

423
0:22:51.260 --> 0:22:53.660
And the cool thing on that is it's

424
0:22:53.660 --> 0:22:57.380
available in every European language natively.

425
0:22:57.380 --> 0:23:02.140
So in Germany, we can pick the German version of the UPL

426
0:23:02.140 --> 0:23:03.460
and use that for licensing.

427
0:23:03.460 --> 0:23:04.700
And then we have a German text.

428
0:23:04.700 --> 0:23:07.980
And if you go to German court, we have then German license text.

429
0:23:07.980 --> 0:23:10.340
In Italy, it's the same as an Italian version, a French

430
0:23:10.340 --> 0:23:10.980
version.

431
0:23:10.980 --> 0:23:16.820
And they are all comparable.

432
0:23:16.820 --> 0:23:18.220
Thank you.

433
0:23:18.220 --> 0:23:39.940
I think we can take one or two questions.

434
0:23:39.940 --> 0:23:42.020
Hi, thank you.

435
0:23:42.020 --> 0:23:43.780
I really appreciate that you've identified

436
0:23:43.780 --> 0:23:48.460
a problem in software procurement with the public sector.

437
0:23:48.460 --> 0:23:51.460
And I see that you're making really useful suggestions.

438
0:23:51.460 --> 0:23:56.140
My question is, is the demand from the public sector

439
0:23:56.140 --> 0:23:57.820
to do these things?

440
0:23:57.820 --> 0:24:01.020
Or are you proactively making these suggestions?

441
0:24:01.020 --> 0:24:03.180
Does the public sector understand

442
0:24:03.180 --> 0:24:06.460
that these are challenges in procurement?

443
0:24:06.460 --> 0:24:09.060
Or what is the situation from the other side?

444
0:24:09.060 --> 0:24:11.380
Thank you.

445
0:24:11.380 --> 0:24:16.420
So does the public sector understand the demand

446
0:24:16.420 --> 0:24:17.780
for open source stuff like that?

447
0:24:17.780 --> 0:24:22.740
So it depends a bit to whom you are talking.

448
0:24:22.740 --> 0:24:26.860
As I said in this coalition contract, on very top level,

449
0:24:26.860 --> 0:24:29.060
they say we want to do open source.

450
0:24:29.060 --> 0:24:30.220
And then it goes down.

451
0:24:30.220 --> 0:24:31.980
And then you think like, then there

452
0:24:31.980 --> 0:24:33.980
are people that probably got the order.

453
0:24:33.980 --> 0:24:36.740
We have to order open source stuff.

454
0:24:36.740 --> 0:24:38.180
What is that?

455
0:24:38.180 --> 0:24:40.100
And then they probably make a tender.

456
0:24:40.100 --> 0:24:42.020
And sometimes you have a complete new thing

457
0:24:42.020 --> 0:24:42.900
that should be built.

458
0:24:42.900 --> 0:24:46.460
Then they just probably put the tag open source,

459
0:24:46.460 --> 0:24:48.500
or it has to be open source on that.

460
0:24:48.500 --> 0:24:50.380
And if they just go for any software,

461
0:24:50.380 --> 0:24:55.420
like a video chat solution, then they should be open.

462
0:24:55.420 --> 0:24:57.700
And then it depends on the person

463
0:24:57.700 --> 0:25:00.460
if they know what open source is and if they know it

464
0:25:00.460 --> 0:25:10.820
the right way.
