1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.640
I am now going to get out of Pablo's way so that he can begin his excellent presentation.

2
0:00:11.640 --> 0:00:12.640
Thank you for being here, Pablo.

3
0:00:12.640 --> 0:00:13.640
Thank you.

4
0:00:13.640 --> 0:00:18.640
Will you give Pablo a round of applause?

5
0:00:18.640 --> 0:00:19.640
Okay.

6
0:00:19.640 --> 0:00:32.080
Hello, my name is Pablo.

7
0:00:32.080 --> 0:00:40.600
Okay, I'm going to talk about the frequent OCD, okay, as an open source idea to show

8
0:00:40.600 --> 0:00:43.880
the community your contributions, okay?

9
0:00:43.880 --> 0:00:50.760
And the first question is, you have to think yourself, does your OCD follow one standard,

10
0:00:50.760 --> 0:00:51.760
okay?

11
0:00:51.760 --> 0:00:58.120
And the main goal of this talk, okay, is to create a community to give a project to solve

12
0:00:58.120 --> 0:01:00.160
the main question, okay?

13
0:01:00.160 --> 0:01:05.600
The community has already started on that link, so feel free to go there.

14
0:01:05.600 --> 0:01:14.960
And the question is, how do we show our contributions to the free culture communities?

15
0:01:14.960 --> 0:01:23.080
Okay, in my opinion, we need like a free culture OCD and we will talk about it.

16
0:01:23.080 --> 0:01:25.680
This talk is not to show a project, okay?

17
0:01:25.680 --> 0:01:31.720
It's not a demo and it's not to show the latest updates of something.

18
0:01:31.720 --> 0:01:43.000
This talk is to discuss about the creation of an open OCD standard, to get more environmental

19
0:01:43.000 --> 0:01:49.960
sustainability within papers, and to show how and where to collaborate, okay?

20
0:01:49.960 --> 0:01:56.200
Because the thing is, if you have our profile with the communities that we are contributing

21
0:01:56.200 --> 0:02:04.000
to, if someone sees our profile, you can find out more communities that maybe you don't

22
0:02:04.000 --> 0:02:06.320
know, okay?

23
0:02:06.320 --> 0:02:12.720
So the main goal, as I said, is to create a community and improve the relationship between

24
0:02:12.720 --> 0:02:20.000
the candidates and the regulators, because this relationship currently, I guess, needs

25
0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:21.000
to improve.

26
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:27.880
So one important thing is to have more control over your personal data, okay?

27
0:02:27.880 --> 0:02:31.200
We will see.

28
0:02:31.200 --> 0:02:37.080
This talk is based on four parts.

29
0:02:37.080 --> 0:02:45.760
The first part is a comparison between the 20th century OCD, like the old CVs, and the

30
0:02:45.760 --> 0:02:52.240
20th century CVs, the CVs that we want to create today.

31
0:02:52.240 --> 0:02:59.600
Then we will see the current standard that we in the European Union, we currently have.

32
0:02:59.600 --> 0:03:02.960
As you will see, it's going to be amazing.

33
0:03:02.960 --> 0:03:13.280
Then we will see more about my identity, like the idea of my free-code OCD.

34
0:03:13.280 --> 0:03:20.280
And then we will see things for inspiration in the community to create, to discuss, to

35
0:03:20.280 --> 0:03:24.800
decide, and to build that community.

36
0:03:24.800 --> 0:03:33.320
Okay first, the old CVs are usually not standard, okay?

37
0:03:33.320 --> 0:03:40.200
So each one has a different template, and this is a mess.

38
0:03:40.200 --> 0:03:46.200
We currently have an European standard, but this should be the input.

39
0:03:46.200 --> 0:03:54.640
Linked-in is, we don't want to be at the standard, you know, because currently it has a lot of

40
0:03:54.640 --> 0:03:58.040
users, but it's not the way I think.

41
0:03:58.040 --> 0:04:06.760
And on the other hand, we need to create a standard TV to get all the benefits of the

42
0:04:06.760 --> 0:04:15.240
standard things in terms of the format, the fields, and the features that our CVs should

43
0:04:15.240 --> 0:04:18.400
have.

44
0:04:18.400 --> 0:04:21.640
Then the old CVs are static.

45
0:04:21.640 --> 0:04:28.800
So we have a CV, we print it, and each time you get a new job, you have to create like

46
0:04:28.800 --> 0:04:31.800
a new version or whatever.

47
0:04:31.800 --> 0:04:39.720
So sometimes it happens that our creator asks you, hey, I have your CV, but it's not the

48
0:04:39.720 --> 0:04:40.920
latest one, okay?

49
0:04:40.920 --> 0:04:43.220
So I need the latest one.

50
0:04:43.220 --> 0:04:51.840
So we want that our CV, the 21st century CV, should be dynamic, okay?

51
0:04:51.840 --> 0:04:59.960
Should be a link where, okay, this is my identity, this is my profile, my CV, and then you each

52
0:04:59.960 --> 0:05:02.440
time is referenced by itself.

53
0:05:02.440 --> 0:05:07.880
I mean, you don't have a file that you have to update.

54
0:05:07.880 --> 0:05:15.000
And instead of being asked about, hey, please send you the CV, my link is here, and it will

55
0:05:15.000 --> 0:05:23.080
be always there.

56
0:05:23.080 --> 0:05:27.880
The current CVs, okay, are not searchable and not indexable, okay?

57
0:05:27.880 --> 0:05:36.600
So when the creators have tons of CVs, it's difficult to search inside the papers, and

58
0:05:36.600 --> 0:05:42.840
it's hard to find CVs because they are just papers, you know?

59
0:05:42.840 --> 0:05:50.480
So for example, it's a problem for the recruiters how to find that people between the older

60
0:05:50.480 --> 0:05:55.640
CVs that they have who has a Linux skills, for example.

61
0:05:55.640 --> 0:06:00.080
There is no way because they are just papers.

62
0:06:00.080 --> 0:06:09.920
And so the CV that we want must be searchable and indexable, so our recruiter can say, okay,

63
0:06:09.920 --> 0:06:16.160
please, show me the people with Linux skills, okay?

64
0:06:16.160 --> 0:06:21.240
Current CVs don't have validations, no configurations.

65
0:06:21.240 --> 0:06:24.120
So I can say I am a Harvard student.

66
0:06:24.120 --> 0:06:32.040
I put on my CV, and it's supposed that I am a Harvard student, but I'm not, you know?

67
0:06:32.040 --> 0:06:43.320
So we need a CVs, validable and configurable, with APIs, with links, with whatever, to validate

68
0:06:43.320 --> 0:06:49.040
that the information that we are providing is true, okay?

69
0:06:49.040 --> 0:06:51.640
And then a paper, okay?

70
0:06:51.640 --> 0:06:53.960
We are our current CVs.

71
0:06:53.960 --> 0:07:04.680
Now we are using the PDF, you know, but the paper, it has a problem, and it's how we show

72
0:07:04.680 --> 0:07:10.640
how do we show the multimedia information, right?

73
0:07:10.640 --> 0:07:17.520
We have to create a multimedia CV where we can add our portfolio, our videos, our pictures,

74
0:07:17.520 --> 0:07:19.360
and whatever.

75
0:07:19.360 --> 0:07:28.480
So we get a better portfolio, our CV is not going to trust, because sometimes due to data

76
0:07:28.480 --> 0:07:38.720
protection rights, you have to drop to the CVs, and we get a happy environment, because

77
0:07:38.720 --> 0:07:41.960
we need to, okay?

78
0:07:41.960 --> 0:07:47.840
The second part is the amazing WordPress journey, and as I said, currently we have an open standard

79
0:07:47.840 --> 0:07:56.640
CV that is named E

80
0:07:56.640 --> 0:08:00.480
Uropas, and it's the E Uropan commission project.

81
0:08:00.480 --> 0:08:08.040
So this is starting like this, and I don't know if you can see it, oh, okay.

82
0:08:08.040 --> 0:08:16.800
Looked at it, it's a micro support template, so as you can imagine, this is going to be

83
0:08:16.800 --> 0:08:23.800
...

84
0:08:23.800 --> 0:08:29.800
...

85
0:08:29.800 --> 0:08:34.800
...

86
0:08:34.800 --> 0:08:45.800
As you can see, this is not the way, you know, everyone should feel the E Uropas CV, but it's

87
0:08:45.800 --> 0:08:53.800
a nice list of standard things that a CV should have, you know?

88
0:08:53.800 --> 0:08:59.800
So we will see negative things, but also positive things, okay?

89
0:08:59.800 --> 0:09:07.800
A good idea is to add additional information with your publications, your presentations,

90
0:09:07.800 --> 0:09:09.800
and so on.

91
0:09:09.800 --> 0:09:16.800
But I guess just, it's not enough to show that, you know, maybe I'm linked to the presentation

92
0:09:16.800 --> 0:09:18.800
or the event, you know?

93
0:09:18.800 --> 0:09:26.800
And also maybe I can say that I was on the whatever conference, and who knows that it's

94
0:09:26.800 --> 0:09:27.800
true, you know?

95
0:09:27.800 --> 0:09:30.640
It's hard to find out that.

96
0:09:30.640 --> 0:09:35.560
So we need another way to feel the E Uropas CV, okay?

97
0:09:35.560 --> 0:09:50.560
The E Uropas started in 2024, I don't know, but the thing is that they realized that they

98
0:09:50.560 --> 0:09:51.560
need a portpad, okay?

99
0:09:51.560 --> 0:10:01.800
Because the word template was not enough, and nobody was feeling the CV.

100
0:10:01.800 --> 0:10:06.800
So they create an E Uropas portpad, okay, and let's see the simulation journey where

101
0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:13.480
you are feeling your personal information, then you have your work experience, and you

102
0:10:13.480 --> 0:10:16.680
feel your personal skills.

103
0:10:16.680 --> 0:10:22.920
For example, one personal skill important is the language, okay?

104
0:10:22.920 --> 0:10:24.560
It should be also standard.

105
0:10:24.560 --> 0:10:32.800
There is a current European standard, and you have your digital skills, and there are

106
0:10:32.800 --> 0:10:39.280
suggestions when you are feeling the digital skills, and as you can see, all this is Microsoft

107
0:10:39.280 --> 0:10:44.000
Office digital skill, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel.

108
0:10:44.000 --> 0:10:51.480
I don't know if it's on purpose or not, but many Microsoft things, as you can see, and

109
0:10:51.480 --> 0:10:57.080
I said, okay, I'm going to feel all of them because I'm a practical engineer, you know,

110
0:10:57.080 --> 0:11:00.800
and let's feel all of them.

111
0:11:00.800 --> 0:11:09.080
And then another suggestion started, okay, and as you can see, soon, okay, it's my digital

112
0:11:09.080 --> 0:11:12.320
skill, then Outlook instead of email.

113
0:11:12.320 --> 0:11:21.880
Google, Facebook as an important digital skill on your city.

114
0:11:21.880 --> 0:11:32.240
PowerPoint, okay, and then it started, I feel all of them again, and then some, it turns

115
0:11:32.240 --> 0:11:44.000
to more personal skills like motivated teamwork, and with the skills, and I said, I'm going

116
0:11:44.000 --> 0:11:50.200
to keep continuing with my feeling all of them, and then the amazing digital skill,

117
0:11:50.200 --> 0:11:55.560
I am an internet user, all right?

118
0:11:55.560 --> 0:12:04.960
So this is my CV, as you can see, I am a pretty amazing engineer.

119
0:12:04.960 --> 0:12:10.240
And suddenly I saw, oh, I can create a CV based on this information, this is what I

120
0:12:10.240 --> 0:12:17.880
want, I want to create my CV with my profile, okay, so you feel, again, some information,

121
0:12:17.880 --> 0:12:20.320
let's feel a professional CV.

122
0:12:20.320 --> 0:12:27.080
You can add the statement at the bottom of your CV, and I started to add, we will see

123
0:12:27.080 --> 0:12:33.520
later on, but I started to add all my free culture profiles, I don't know why, but I

124
0:12:33.520 --> 0:12:36.200
want that information in there, okay?

125
0:12:36.200 --> 0:12:41.280
We will see later on the reason.

126
0:12:41.280 --> 0:12:51.440
I created, okay, and there is another feature, it's that you can upload it to AWS network,

127
0:12:51.440 --> 0:12:59.760
okay, this is the most positive thing about the WordPress, and it's like AWS, it's like

128
0:12:59.760 --> 0:13:06.000
a shared network between the European Union countries, where people from other countries

129
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:13.160
can ask for CV for other countries, and if they are available, you can see their CV,

130
0:13:13.160 --> 0:13:23.520
okay, so a common database, I think it's a good idea, but I don't know if AWS is used,

131
0:13:23.520 --> 0:13:33.960
you can check which countries are you willing to work at, you can feed your occupation,

132
0:13:33.960 --> 0:13:42.280
suddenly, okay, my CV is on AWS, so I don't know if that is sending my live app, it's

133
0:13:42.280 --> 0:13:47.480
there, I have the open question if it's a good idea, just to discuss on the community,

134
0:13:47.480 --> 0:13:59.800
okay, but it's a good idea to have an European Union shared CV database, and then this is

135
0:13:59.800 --> 0:14:05.240
to bring show up that it's tell your digitalest case, so as you can imagine before, let's

136
0:14:05.240 --> 0:14:10.160
see this, I mean same thing, I don't know if you can see the questions, but it is like

137
0:14:10.160 --> 0:14:16.600
a self test, I'm able to do this, I'm able to do this, I'm able to do this, okay, it's

138
0:14:16.600 --> 0:14:27.180
a test, then some question that that are great, you know, but the first one is based on some

139
0:14:27.180 --> 0:14:34.020
software and the other one I don't know if it's important to know for an

140
0:14:34.020 --> 0:14:44.340
employer but how many digits the Apple code has. So then I finished my test

141
0:14:44.340 --> 0:14:55.700
they say congratulations and I am an advanced user. Okay so as you can see I

142
0:14:55.700 --> 0:15:06.540
got the highest level and you can generate like a proof that you got that

143
0:15:06.540 --> 0:15:12.580
level. Okay actually they are asking for my name I don't know why because I was

144
0:15:12.580 --> 0:15:24.260
already loving it but it's funny because my label C except band report is also

145
0:15:24.260 --> 0:15:34.900
beyond also to lean on the board. Okay you can type another name and it's okay and

146
0:15:34.900 --> 0:15:40.700
then there is a little bit of roadmap but I don't know why I got this level but I

147
0:15:40.700 --> 0:15:46.580
got the I am a master of remote work really I don't know how they tested that

148
0:15:46.580 --> 0:15:56.620
but I'm and this is my person is he okay you bet I mean this is my opinion this

149
0:15:56.620 --> 0:16:01.740
is an important thing and a cool thing but as you can see the other steps

150
0:16:01.740 --> 0:16:07.900
through the improve. Okay and then the third part is my identity okay my name

151
0:16:07.900 --> 0:16:16.280
is Paulino Khosa. Thanks for the cause mention the cause community mention the

152
0:16:16.280 --> 0:16:23.500
talk before in ESA and we will see the parts that are free to see the issue

153
0:16:23.500 --> 0:16:30.220
must have okay most of them are like a normal CD but the most important thing

154
0:16:30.220 --> 0:16:41.120
is the matrix the I want a CD where you are able to see matrix about the

155
0:16:41.120 --> 0:16:46.140
contributions that to free portal communities that you have done okay

156
0:16:46.140 --> 0:16:52.540
because for equators it's important to know the profile to know how activities

157
0:16:52.540 --> 0:17:05.580
are on how active the the person is on on the frequent or community and I mean

158
0:17:05.580 --> 0:17:12.300
it's in my opinion it shows many information about our identity on how

159
0:17:12.300 --> 0:17:21.980
the way we we work. One of the most important things in in your community in

160
0:17:21.980 --> 0:17:32.460
your CD is your identity okay it's hard to to implement an identity start where

161
0:17:32.460 --> 0:17:39.220
an open identity start and we have two options the first one is key base okay

162
0:17:39.220 --> 0:17:47.020
I suppose that it's well known here it's as a pro it's open source it's privacy

163
0:17:47.020 --> 0:17:54.780
and security focused and it's easy to install okay but as a con it's type of

164
0:17:54.780 --> 0:18:01.380
confirmation and must be developed okay because we will say that

165
0:18:01.380 --> 0:18:09.060
as I said the confirmation it's important to to give trustness to our

166
0:18:09.060 --> 0:18:15.940
CD okay another concept that the server is not open source is not widely used

167
0:18:15.940 --> 0:18:25.980
and it's not focused only on online identity okay so the other one the other

168
0:18:25.980 --> 0:18:34.260
way to create your identity that I prefer that it's key upside that we will

169
0:18:34.260 --> 0:18:45.540
see Aladdin talk later on at 1 p.m. as you can see this is the the Yarmul profile

170
0:18:45.540 --> 0:18:55.740
and this is one of the most important slides because my identity it's my DNA

171
0:18:55.740 --> 0:19:04.100
so my the DNS of my website my github profile my good luck profile and whatever

172
0:19:04.100 --> 0:19:10.300
community you know and I want the most important thing is to generate metrics

173
0:19:10.300 --> 0:19:17.060
about the contributions that using my my community profile let's say you love or

174
0:19:17.060 --> 0:19:25.060
or get help or whatever another thing is the work experience okay we have to have

175
0:19:25.060 --> 0:19:31.780
a list with the companies you have worked out description and the

176
0:19:31.780 --> 0:19:37.980
possibility to add validations that that is to worry and also the recommendations

177
0:19:37.980 --> 0:19:43.020
in terms of education and it's and training is almost the same list of

178
0:19:43.020 --> 0:19:47.500
course description of the content and possibility of the validations for

179
0:19:47.500 --> 0:19:54.620
example I read had certified so that provides a workplace where do you submit

180
0:19:54.620 --> 0:20:02.100
the identity of the certification and work address okay there that person is

181
0:20:02.100 --> 0:20:11.060
certified it's true that what is what are they saying then about the skills I

182
0:20:11.060 --> 0:20:16.860
suppose that it should be mostly free text and we give a multimedia and we

183
0:20:16.860 --> 0:20:25.020
also need validations and this is a list of some of my profile in some communities

184
0:20:25.020 --> 0:20:32.420
you know so we are going to for example this is my profile so I need a way to

185
0:20:32.420 --> 0:20:38.700
get metrics of my contributions to the we can make it we can make a environment

186
0:20:38.700 --> 0:20:48.620
let's say so for example I have a hundred forty image in open street maps

187
0:20:48.620 --> 0:20:56.220
I made a 49 edits as you can see in my profile on open street maps you already

188
0:20:56.220 --> 0:21:03.260
you already have a way to have to get the metrics of the job contributions okay

189
0:21:03.260 --> 0:21:11.700
here you can see some statistics about the internal statistics about my open

190
0:21:11.700 --> 0:21:16.060
street map contributions then you get graphs that the problem is that the

191
0:21:16.060 --> 0:21:20.460
platform that I'm using is not open source you know so the community should

192
0:21:20.460 --> 0:21:28.020
be another way to get that data and to show metrics and to to tell more about

193
0:21:28.020 --> 0:21:35.180
our contributions okay then this is my GitHub profile and I'm already including

194
0:21:35.180 --> 0:21:45.140
metrics inside my GitHub my GitHub profile and there are several ways to

195
0:21:45.140 --> 0:21:53.820
to get those metrics okay the first one is the GitHub really starts project that

196
0:21:53.820 --> 0:22:02.380
it's pretty popular it's more than 51 K half stars and you get the metrics about

197
0:22:02.380 --> 0:22:07.100
your contributions and also that you're the most used language which is this

198
0:22:07.100 --> 0:22:12.620
information is pretty useful for the degree to survey because it tells more

199
0:22:12.620 --> 0:22:20.460
about us that okay I go to the interview and I say I'm an amazing PHP developer

200
0:22:20.460 --> 0:22:26.220
but if then we show your contributions are your contributions are not so good

201
0:22:26.220 --> 0:22:35.100
maybe they they get their recruiters get more information about that another

202
0:22:35.100 --> 0:22:43.140
platform is metrics like up the dial where you can see some statistics and

203
0:22:43.140 --> 0:22:50.780
on the latest version there are pretty cool graphs and things that more or less

204
0:22:50.780 --> 0:23:00.220
are true but as I said we have to to get that information basically from what they

205
0:23:00.220 --> 0:23:07.980
give half API and and provide them in another way another it's web latte that I

206
0:23:07.980 --> 0:23:14.500
got 62 translations you know but and maybe for a for a recruiter of

207
0:23:14.500 --> 0:23:20.420
translator maybe it's important it's how activities on this community that it's

208
0:23:20.420 --> 0:23:28.540
based on its focus it on translations you know and on gird lab I have

209
0:23:28.540 --> 0:23:36.300
contributed mostly in my work 260 project and again we have to find a way

210
0:23:36.300 --> 0:23:44.340
to get this kind of metrics in open foot fat for to survive product and I'm at

211
0:23:44.340 --> 0:23:48.940
code that okay I'm a starter I have started the free quarter city that is

212
0:23:48.940 --> 0:23:59.020
the repository of the the community that I want to build finally a the last part

213
0:23:59.020 --> 0:24:06.060
is the things for inspiration and the first thing is that we already have a

214
0:24:06.060 --> 0:24:15.140
open CV format but it's made by the Spanish recruiters company but it's

215
0:24:15.140 --> 0:24:23.740
based on the Asian of a and this could be the first point for inspiration then

216
0:24:23.740 --> 0:24:31.200
we have to be old we have to create see builders we have here I left for

217
0:24:31.200 --> 0:24:38.940
examples of open source projects that led you to create your CV based on your

218
0:24:38.940 --> 0:24:46.700
guitar profile okay and you got the you enter your information and you get the

219
0:24:46.700 --> 0:24:55.140
your CV in several ways a PDF what page or whatever then one of the most

220
0:24:55.140 --> 0:25:05.580
important things that we have to develop extractors and converters and to we need

221
0:25:05.580 --> 0:25:15.140
the structures to get the information for the the API to to then show them and

222
0:25:15.140 --> 0:25:20.060
we have to create converters to make the life easier for the people that they

223
0:25:20.060 --> 0:25:25.660
have a link in profile and we need a converter for longer your link link it

224
0:25:25.660 --> 0:25:32.860
in CV to the job free quarter CV or maybe a translator to all the pass or I

225
0:25:32.860 --> 0:25:39.300
mean we have to provide ways to avoid just feeling again the information

226
0:25:39.300 --> 0:25:50.220
because I already put in another platform and a list of things that we

227
0:25:50.220 --> 0:25:56.700
should talk about is the ethical things you know that the protection about the

228
0:25:56.700 --> 0:26:06.080
protection for example in Spain many people put the street the street they

229
0:26:06.080 --> 0:26:12.140
read this on the CV I don't know if it's useful or not but for example in the UK

230
0:26:12.140 --> 0:26:19.280
is not possible to add your profile you're a picture of yourself and another

231
0:26:19.280 --> 0:26:26.220
ethical things that do I think we should discuss we have to choose a backend how

232
0:26:26.220 --> 0:26:31.260
they we extract of the information I see it's our past maybe the error passes

233
0:26:31.260 --> 0:26:39.780
that is way to start or maybe we have to sell develop another option then we

234
0:26:39.780 --> 0:26:46.740
have to make a decision if we should have a CV public database if it's always

235
0:26:46.740 --> 0:26:54.420
maybe the project itself it's the best way or the best the place for example

236
0:26:54.420 --> 0:27:04.520
the key oxide is using just your GPD key so maybe that's enough and we have to

237
0:27:04.520 --> 0:27:12.820
provide a way to to allow to share our personal data okay first but maybe we

238
0:27:12.820 --> 0:27:20.620
don't want to add to our CV the the the contact but if a recruiter is asking a

239
0:27:20.620 --> 0:27:26.780
PPA send me your email your phone maybe you we need a way to okay I'm going to I

240
0:27:26.780 --> 0:27:36.580
want to provide this information to this operator then would be important and the

241
0:27:36.580 --> 0:27:43.660
last one is if we should provide virtual compatibility to the old CV okay so we

242
0:27:43.660 --> 0:27:50.780
feel all the information in our amazing a free culture CD but maybe the old

243
0:27:50.780 --> 0:27:57.380
recruiters let's say they need the old CDs I don't know why and maybe to a CV

244
0:27:57.380 --> 0:28:05.140
that could be a printable is a PDF export the best a PDF it's it's important

245
0:28:05.140 --> 0:28:12.140
and obviously we will find another questions on the way and we so let's

246
0:28:12.140 --> 0:28:17.660
start the community and let's discuss that this is the best attempt that I have

247
0:28:17.660 --> 0:28:26.060
seen about the free culture or CV focused on the brokers okay the problem

248
0:28:26.060 --> 0:28:33.540
is that the repo it is already on you have and it's pretty popular but the

249
0:28:33.540 --> 0:28:42.300
webpage is not working so maybe a four but I don't know but there you can show

250
0:28:42.300 --> 0:28:53.620
your developers case so here we see metrics about our

251
0:28:53.620 --> 0:29:01.020
internet our profile let's say the technologies that we use funny facts

252
0:29:01.020 --> 0:29:07.300
and our personal repositories for example I like a lot the idea and it's

253
0:29:07.300 --> 0:29:15.020
more or less the CV that I would like to know to have and finally take home

254
0:29:15.020 --> 0:29:19.900
message okay we have many reasons to improve the way that we are creating

255
0:29:19.900 --> 0:29:28.740
cities as you saw before we need to create a the newest standard and the

256
0:29:28.740 --> 0:29:33.900
newest and that must be community developed because it seems I don't know

257
0:29:33.900 --> 0:29:39.740
I'm not sure but it seems that Microsoft for example took part on the

258
0:29:39.740 --> 0:29:47.660
auto pass the definition which have to show metrics about our collaboration so

259
0:29:47.660 --> 0:29:53.300
if you are interested and you think this is important please join us about

260
0:29:53.300 --> 0:30:00.380
community and less discuss and less to be on something that I think it's

261
0:30:00.380 --> 0:30:07.220
affects to everyone and it's important for us as a community and also as a

262
0:30:07.220 --> 0:30:15.420
person they open sources stuff and the open culture stuff so thank you

263
0:30:15.420 --> 0:30:26.260
I think this thing is on this thing is on thank you so much Pablo
