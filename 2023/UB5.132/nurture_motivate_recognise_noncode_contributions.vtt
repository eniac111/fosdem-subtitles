00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome back. If you thought it was quiet before, it's not anymore. I will now remember

00:12.000 --> 00:16.200
to remove my mask so that anyone who may be following along on the live stream and lip

00:16.200 --> 00:20.900
reading will be able to hear my comments. We're going to go ahead and slide back into

00:20.900 --> 00:28.560
our sessions for the day and I am very pleased to introduce Alex to talk to us about nurturing,

00:28.560 --> 00:33.480
motivating and recognizing non-code contributions, a subject near and dear to my heart as an

00:33.480 --> 00:38.240
open source community member who is not a developer. So if we could get a round of applause

00:38.240 --> 00:41.000
to welcome Alex, that would be great.

00:41.000 --> 00:53.880
Hey. Nice to see you all. So let's start. My name is Alexa Bramova and I work in Percona

00:53.880 --> 00:59.880
for two years in Percona Community Team and I'm really inspired by the idea that open

00:59.880 --> 01:06.360
source can be open to everyone with diversity of experience and not necessarily a technical

01:06.360 --> 01:16.240
one. First couple words about the company. Percona provides best of breed, support, consulting,

01:16.240 --> 01:24.200
managed services, training and free and open source software for MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB,

01:24.200 --> 01:32.120
Postgres. So we make applications and databases run better. Please check our website for more

01:32.120 --> 01:40.960
information. I'm sure you can find everything for you and for your applications. Also Percona

01:40.960 --> 01:53.240
is a remote first company with 350 employees now in almost 40 countries. I think it's great.

01:53.240 --> 02:00.040
Percona gathered a great experience in working with open source contributions and today we

02:00.040 --> 02:06.360
will talk specifically about non-code contributions in particular and we will look at the different

02:06.360 --> 02:13.280
types of non-code contributions and we will discuss how we can provide value to your project

02:13.280 --> 02:27.280
and team and how to engage and empower contributors. When we talk about open source contributions,

02:27.280 --> 02:36.280
nowadays we still often associate them with coding, with tech gigs, who contribute code

02:36.280 --> 02:46.200
and understand all those strange words like fork, pull request and etc. But the open source

02:46.200 --> 02:53.040
world is very extensive and diverse and I believe that everyone can find their place

02:53.040 --> 03:01.240
there. Even if someone doesn't feel confident with coding, there are still lots of things

03:01.240 --> 03:13.240
to keep them busy. So what are the types of non-code contributions? They include technical

03:13.240 --> 03:22.000
writing, copy editing, translations and everything working with text, testing reporting issues,

03:22.000 --> 03:30.360
designing and advocating, social media coverage and this list is not an extensive one so if

03:30.360 --> 03:38.360
you have any ideas we can add them here too. Just use your imagination. And we will look

03:38.360 --> 03:47.040
into these types a bit more deeper. First is technical writing, copy editing and professionals

03:47.040 --> 03:53.240
who are good working with text can have a lot of work to do. For example, help with

03:53.240 --> 04:01.120
translations and localizations to expand your open source project to different markets.

04:01.120 --> 04:08.520
Maintaining documentation is also a thing that is a source of worries for many open

04:08.520 --> 04:17.280
source projects. A lot of stuff might be needed here from simple hard tools to updates about

04:17.280 --> 04:28.160
new releases and new features. Blogging, which type is my favorite one actually and it includes

04:28.160 --> 04:36.560
help with spreading the word about this project, a project you might love. For example, posting

04:36.560 --> 04:45.080
technical content in your personal blog or different blogging platforms about experience

04:45.080 --> 04:52.000
you gained in styling software in different environments, about basic configurations for

04:52.000 --> 05:02.800
beginners, best practices, tuning and monitoring of a tool, life hacks for experienced users,

05:02.800 --> 05:11.480
how this helps you in your profession, in your business and possible alternatives to

05:11.480 --> 05:23.520
this tool, the ideas of different tools. Next is testing. It includes providing valuable

05:23.520 --> 05:30.880
feedback, looking from the position of the end user or a developer who works with the

05:30.880 --> 05:39.360
tool. For example, reporting issues, describing unexpected strange behavior, reporting bugs,

05:39.360 --> 05:48.720
filling out the surveys and also creating feature requests and sharing your ideas about

05:48.720 --> 05:57.960
future project development. Designing. Well, here, depending on the professional focus

05:57.960 --> 06:05.520
of an individual, there is a wide range of involvement from UI improvements to banner

06:05.520 --> 06:15.240
and format graphics design. Not all open source projects have resources to hire a designer

06:15.240 --> 06:23.200
to involve him into development. And for a contributor, it is also a good way to add

06:23.200 --> 06:33.400
interesting projects to their portfolio. Advocating. So there are lots of things that can be done

06:33.400 --> 06:43.080
here. It includes sharing posts on social media on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, whatever.

06:43.080 --> 06:51.440
Recording YouTube shorts and videos, streaming about software you like. If a person has a

06:51.440 --> 06:58.320
podcast, he can invite project maintainers to discuss different aspects of the project,

06:58.320 --> 07:07.000
its value and perspectives. Active speakers can also include in their presentations mentions

07:07.000 --> 07:16.200
of a project they like. And it all helps to grow open source projects, especially small

07:16.200 --> 07:27.360
ones. And also living reviews on software marketplaces can be also included here. So

07:27.360 --> 07:36.040
let's talk a bit why you need noncode contributions. First, it gives you resources to fill in the

07:36.040 --> 07:43.680
gaps. It's not a secret that developers may struggle, for example, to maintain a communication.

07:43.680 --> 07:51.840
You may not have resources for proper testing. Improving usability or localization. Well,

07:51.840 --> 08:00.240
coding is super important, but it's not always enough. Well, it helps you to become more

08:00.240 --> 08:08.600
visible. For example, this can specifically apply to reviews on software marketplaces where people

08:08.600 --> 08:15.880
come to choose software for their development, for their bad projects, student projects, and

08:15.880 --> 08:26.960
not only bad projects. When it motivates your developer team, when we see how people share

08:26.960 --> 08:34.520
pictures of t shorts with your project time on Twitter, how many reviews they have. When

08:34.520 --> 08:42.280
they see how people use your software and create their own tutorials and explain how

08:42.280 --> 08:51.160
they use this software in their use case. It's very, very valuable for a developer team

08:51.160 --> 09:04.880
to see that. Well, last but not the least, it does make the world a better place for

09:04.880 --> 09:13.600
everyone. Open doors for those who didn't have opportunities to obtain systematic technical

09:13.600 --> 09:24.080
knowledge due to different reasons, maybe economical, personal, whatever. For example,

09:24.080 --> 09:30.760
I myself didn't obtain technical knowledge. I have a humanitarian experience, humanitarian

09:30.760 --> 09:38.480
knowledge, but now I'm giving a talk at the biggest open source event in Europe. Open

09:38.480 --> 09:47.360
source did a big work for me and I believe that everyone who is interested in technologies

09:47.360 --> 10:05.120
can follow my path. Thank you. Okay. So profits for non-coder. What can there be? There are

10:05.120 --> 10:12.400
many. They can share their professional skills and obtain diversified experience with different

10:12.400 --> 10:21.120
projects. In which portfolio connect with community, which is very important, and interact

10:21.120 --> 10:31.400
with passionate people. And I think it also brings lots of fun in your life. So how can

10:31.400 --> 10:43.000
we involve more non-code contributions? And how we work with them in Percona? Offer small

10:43.000 --> 10:49.560
reward for compression of particular task that you need. For example, in Percona, we

10:49.560 --> 10:56.200
launched several campaigns for living a review on software marketplaces, following a technical

10:56.200 --> 11:06.080
review where a user describes his experience, his use case. And we offered t-shirts with

11:06.080 --> 11:15.680
our logo or marks delivered worldwide. People also tend to love $5 Amazon gift cards. And

11:15.680 --> 11:22.000
you can launch campaigns with clear requirements, describe what you want to see, and deadline

11:22.000 --> 11:28.200
to motivate people to participate. And then publish it on your blog post and share social

11:28.200 --> 11:38.880
media. We also reward those who report security issues. In Percona, we have forum. And we

11:38.880 --> 11:46.840
also reward active users of a forum, people who help others and answer questions of the

11:46.840 --> 11:52.560
community. If you don't have a forum but have a Slack channel or Discord channel, you can

11:52.560 --> 12:02.760
also do the same. Be creative and find what's important for you. To send swag, we use Shopify

12:02.760 --> 12:10.720
and Printful and Printify. Printful and Printify are providers of t-shirts and all this swag

12:10.720 --> 12:18.040
stuff. We just add their logo. They have very simple design tools. Even if you do not have

12:18.040 --> 12:27.920
any design skills, you can do something simple there. And when we send them worldwide, when

12:27.920 --> 12:40.920
we participate in different challenges, like Octoberfest in 2022 last year, we did a special

12:40.920 --> 12:47.400
focus on non-code contributors and Percona repositories also persevered in Octoberfest.

12:47.400 --> 12:56.240
We had about 20 contributions and half of them were non-code contributions. For your

12:56.240 --> 13:07.080
swag gifts, personalize them if possible. We also do this in Printful. We add these

13:07.080 --> 13:16.720
nice messages to Alice from Percona with Love, to Matt from Percona with Love. And actually,

13:16.720 --> 13:27.480
it cost us additionally $2.5. And people love to see this way. When they get, they take

13:27.480 --> 13:33.440
pictures, they share them on Twitter, they send these pictures to us. We collect them

13:33.440 --> 13:46.640
and also share. And actually, it makes them not only make one contribution, like someone

13:46.640 --> 13:55.160
fixed a report or reported an issue. And for example, he got his t-shirt and when he started

13:55.160 --> 14:04.240
sharing on Twitter, we didn't even ask him. It makes his contribution even larger. Make

14:04.240 --> 14:15.760
a word visible and document them for the history. Publish blogs on your blog's platform or on

14:15.760 --> 14:23.240
social media. For example, here we posted a blog post who recognized every contributor

14:23.240 --> 14:31.640
and described who did what, how he contributed to Percona repositories during October 1st.

14:31.640 --> 14:44.120
And we love to post such things because people love recognition. We also publish all contributions,

14:44.120 --> 14:52.440
community videos, articles, our repositories, our software on our community website, Percona.community.

14:52.440 --> 15:03.040
We collect them in the list. We share them on Twitter. Here is the example of Twitter.

15:03.040 --> 15:10.400
Percona bytes, it is our community Twitter account. We tag contributors if we can find

15:10.400 --> 15:22.320
them on Twitter. And people love being recognized like this. What's important, of course, is

15:22.320 --> 15:33.800
providing clear instructions for non-experienced users. How to contribute. How to publish a

15:33.800 --> 15:43.840
blog post on your website. How to contribute in different ways. And we also trying to make

15:43.840 --> 15:53.320
sure that we are leaving our email everywhere we can. So people who even read this post

15:53.320 --> 16:00.480
but had issues posting, had questions, have doubts, could easily find our contact information

16:00.480 --> 16:10.080
and then we could guide them through the process. Our website and blog use Hugo Engine and I

16:10.080 --> 16:23.080
believe it's quite easy for everyone to use. Even I coped with it. Okay. So give a list

16:23.080 --> 16:32.000
of ideas. Give a list of things you believe your project needs right now. Just write them

16:32.000 --> 16:42.200
and post openly on your website, on your blog, so people knew they could find and understand

16:42.200 --> 16:53.320
what you need right now. Also, we love to host streams and podcasts and provide a space

16:53.320 --> 17:02.480
for people to come, invite people and talk on different topics. They can include their

17:02.480 --> 17:12.400
career path, open source trends they see. Everything. Not necessarily just coding. And

17:12.400 --> 17:24.520
to host streams we use ReStream, Riverside and PUBbean. If you have a community advocate

17:24.520 --> 17:36.200
program, make sure you include noncode contributions in that and recognize contributors too. We

17:36.200 --> 17:44.880
have cast written dashboards which help us to optimize the process of rewarding people

17:44.880 --> 17:49.560
who made noncode contributions, who posted blogs and videos or mentioned us in their

17:49.560 --> 18:02.320
talks. And we also use Orbit Love for that. And the last thing, but not the least, in

18:02.320 --> 18:11.840
your messaging, emphasize why it matters. Why noncode contributions really matters to

18:11.840 --> 18:21.200
your project. Explain that it is contribution indeed. Recognize it as a contribution. Because

18:21.200 --> 18:27.640
noncoders tend to underestimate what they do. They think like, okay, I just fix the

18:27.640 --> 18:35.880
people. Everyone can do that. No, not everyone. Not everyone will do. Not everyone will stop

18:35.880 --> 18:49.200
by and spend five minutes on your project. So thank you for your attention. Pecona is

18:49.200 --> 18:58.600
hiring. You can check to our website. And also this is nice part of my presentation.

18:58.600 --> 19:06.740
You can participate in a raffle. Scan this QR code and you can win a ticket to Pecona

19:06.740 --> 19:14.480
Live conference in Denver which will take place in May. You need to scan the QR code.

19:14.480 --> 19:20.080
Fill out a simple form and we will choose one winner randomly after that.
