0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:16.600
Five more seconds so you can start.

2
0:00:16.600 --> 0:00:18.240
Thank you very much for having me.

3
0:00:18.240 --> 0:00:19.680
Do you hear me back there?

4
0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:20.680
Yes.

5
0:00:20.680 --> 0:00:21.680
Lovely.

6
0:00:21.680 --> 0:00:22.680
All right.

7
0:00:22.680 --> 0:00:23.680
Okay.

8
0:00:23.680 --> 0:00:28.000
I'm Konrad, and I have the opposite of problems, and I have a million of problems compared

9
0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:29.240
to Geran.

10
0:00:29.240 --> 0:00:34.160
Because Geran had performance issues, that was the thing before, and he tried to parse

11
0:00:34.160 --> 0:00:37.800
DNS zone files really fast.

12
0:00:37.800 --> 0:00:43.240
In the I2P network, which is an overlay network which provides anonymity, we have that few

13
0:00:43.240 --> 0:00:44.400
hosts.

14
0:00:44.400 --> 0:00:47.080
We don't even need to think about performance.

15
0:00:47.080 --> 0:00:49.400
We have, as I said, one million other problems.

16
0:00:49.400 --> 0:00:55.200
Now, the students of the University of Applied Science got the job from me to take a look

17
0:00:55.200 --> 0:00:59.800
at this DNS problem because the I2P network has no DNS.

18
0:00:59.800 --> 0:01:24.800
So welcome to Stone Age.
