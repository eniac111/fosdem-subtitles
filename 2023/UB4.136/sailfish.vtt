WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
So that's much better there.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah.

00:15.000 --> 00:29.980
Personally, I think it's like in a perfect world, everyone would have just used mainline and everyone would be happy and this would be this would be

00:29.980 --> 00:41.980
a dream world. And while I'm a YOLA developer, in my own opinion, what postmark it is, what they do is awesome. And if everything would work this way, we at YOLA probably wouldn't have

00:41.980 --> 00:55.980
would use Sony OSB, but it's not at its place. And so I still advocate to use high-wors, especially if you have an open platform, which also has open communication. This is still why I think

00:55.980 --> 01:25.960
open Sony Open device is still a good target to port to. And a lot of Android applications, or Android even just Android ROMs have the problem. They don't have the blessing of the window. So as long as you do it for yourself, it may be fine. Nothing will happen. But you don't know. Lawyer can write you a fancy letter and tell you why are you doing this and now you're broken, you know. And that's about you. And we at YOLA, we cannot do that. So that's why we choose only Sony Open device.

01:25.960 --> 01:51.960
And then one thing, especially for someone that's inexperienced, going to Sony Open devices and trying to start a device is easier because there's existing structure and guidance there. And open communication is like someone behind some back channel where you have to talk to some specific person. They talk to you.

01:51.960 --> 02:19.960
The communication is not always perfect, but they talk, do talk to you. And that's like, this makes a huge, huge difference. And then also the lifetime is really long. Whereas for other devices, you may be stuck in one kernel. Sony Open device actively upgrades to downstream kernel that they have to their devices. So that's also the reason why we don't use Android. So the Android updates don't really do that much. It's still an important factor for someone to decide.

02:19.960 --> 02:35.960
So it's not mainline, but it's like in between being stuck on a really old downstream kernel where you have a long, more up to date LTS kernel that has like most of the features that you need, but also makes it more attractive for to port Linux to.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.960
Yeah.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.960
Yeah, I think I kind of skipped this already.

02:42.960 --> 03:03.960
So contributing to Sony Open devices. So personally, I started contributing to it because I wanted to have a different device that I wanted to run safe shares on because I like to say fish as a platform, but I wanted to have more devices and Yolo while it's a reasonable choice started with the expert and series.

03:03.960 --> 03:13.960
But I want a better device with a better display and so and better hardware, of course. So I choose that.

03:13.960 --> 03:25.960
And if you have something of experience, you can start to try to run HP on it quite easily. You just have to know how to use Linux a little bit and have a device in the computer.

03:25.960 --> 03:34.960
And that's it really, except maybe some programming skills, but a lot of things you can just learn while you go and you don't really have to be an expert person myself.

03:34.960 --> 03:43.960
I'm not someone that has a university degree or a local education, a formal certification or something. I have nothing. I just learned it while I learned.

03:43.960 --> 03:47.960
And here I am.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.960
I think you don't always have to go this way.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.960
Yeah.

03:54.960 --> 04:03.960
So and then I wanted to highlight how Sony contributes because I think many people wonder, like, how what's the relationship of Sony and Yolo?

04:03.960 --> 04:10.960
Because it kind of looks like there's like some some some deeper level of communication there.

04:10.960 --> 04:18.960
Well, yes, we talk to Sony. We have someone to talk to at Sony, but it's except that we're not really someone that gets special treatment.

04:18.960 --> 04:25.960
We just want a contributor and anyone anyone can to be in contributor to to Sony open devices.

04:25.960 --> 04:35.960
And the chance that then you go goes into Yolo devices is quite high then because of the way the Sony open devices works and the way that you can reuse work.

04:35.960 --> 04:47.960
So we use it through some it runs Sony reference Sony devices, a reference port, which then you can use to put other Sony devices to other devices of the same Android base.

04:47.960 --> 04:58.960
Because nowadays, thanks to Google, a lot of things are more sanitized and you don't really depend on one specific device vendor, which is still not mainline.

04:58.960 --> 05:10.960
But it's getting there. And and I think Google as a company, they listen and they if they could make everyone work with mainline, then they would probably do that as they would do with Chrome OS.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.960
But device vendors are like stubborn.

05:13.960 --> 05:24.960
So things change slowly. Yeah. And usually we are more focusing on refining a specific target device, not adaptation.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.960
That's part of quality of the other adaptation is then better than it was before.

05:28.960 --> 05:39.960
Usually not everything is perfect, but it's it's sometimes sometimes sometimes hard like camera stuff or audio.

05:39.960 --> 05:45.960
The audio guy when he talks, it's in our company, it's sometimes like he's no more some kind of black magic skills that I don't know.

05:45.960 --> 05:52.960
And it's it's it's really something. Yeah. And there and we generally contribute quite frequently back.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.960
So most of the work that we do to Sony open devices goes back to them.

05:57.960 --> 06:04.960
Some stuff is specific, but not really. It's depends on how much effort is.

06:04.960 --> 06:13.960
Yeah. So as I said, originally I didn't really talk about mainline, but I still want to advocate for it since I think it's a good thing.

06:13.960 --> 06:21.960
And if possible, if your device has a mainline port and the main import is in a state where it's OK, then then try to push it.

06:21.960 --> 06:27.960
So I think the really big thing about what hybrids is like this.

06:27.960 --> 06:36.960
It's like, you know, when the devil gives you in the garden of Eden gave them the apple, you know, like the the easiest solution that's like hybrids.

06:36.960 --> 06:44.960
So so that's why I think it's still a good thing. And as I said, we're not in the perfect world, Sally.

06:44.960 --> 06:50.960
And then Sony's house is the quality is good to OK, depending on the area or some areas like camera.

06:50.960 --> 06:56.960
OK. But that's like just about the topic in general. It's not really their fault. And it's and it's open.

06:56.960 --> 07:04.960
So it's just a clear line between the separation of the blobs and even open device, even like mainline devices that have a main line kernel.

07:04.960 --> 07:10.960
They don't want without blobs at all. It has some firmware and just to the way that the firm is on a different level.

07:10.960 --> 07:22.960
That's really a big difference. And because you have no features also probably a little bit more blobs, but it's just that's why it's why it's easier to get there.

07:22.960 --> 07:27.960
And in a lot of ways, like it's really.

07:27.960 --> 07:35.960
Mainline tech sometimes to get there, whereas hybrid is easier to have some kind of functionality.

07:35.960 --> 07:46.960
And yeah, really, I mean, I kind of was nice and in a long one, it's really better, but it's on-stream chrono, gives you gives like a better base.

07:46.960 --> 07:56.960
It's just an along one. It's just. No, it's annoying. And while Qualcomm is better than anyone else, really, it's still not nice.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.960
Sometimes there's funny stuff in the kernel that you don't expect.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.960
And then they rub your time when you just try to update the kernel.

08:05.960 --> 08:20.960
With Sony, probably feels quite often. So, and I kind of skipped the spot already, but I wanted to wanted to give like, like some ideas for target reactions.

08:20.960 --> 08:36.960
So I quite strongly follow the port of a Calib to this SEM 845, which is the I think 2009 2020 high end sock from Qualcomm.

08:36.960 --> 08:44.960
And those are really what was very good today. They're good start to try and to think around and then to go further.

08:44.960 --> 08:53.960
While those are mostly one plus, there's also an SO main nine port to it, I think, but SO in main nine right now, as sort of stated, I could demo it.

08:53.960 --> 08:59.960
If it was, I would have shown something here that was idea, but sadly I couldn't get that far. So yeah.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.960
And then the pine for another pine from pro as a really great devices.

09:03.960 --> 09:09.960
And we also have ports to the pine phone and Python pro and our and our stand.

09:09.960 --> 09:15.960
You can can see them can see them. You don't have a pine from pro here, but we will probably find some people that have it.

09:15.960 --> 09:25.960
And then we can show you. And then this may be some strange, but in some ways, KVM is really good target to try main line on because it's PC hardware, essentially.

09:25.960 --> 09:38.960
And you can develop like the basic middleware components on it and then have like a testing target that you can for people to try out and to just have it running.

09:38.960 --> 09:48.960
It's great. And I also, if time I can show the demo of it, I have one on my notebook and if not, then on my stand or an hour stand there.

09:48.960 --> 09:59.960
So, so as I said, I'm a developer, but I come from the community and I want to give back to the community and I am.

09:59.960 --> 10:13.960
Want to bring some of the processes that we have to the community in the same way or in a little bit same way as as a right here and most of the processes that should probably work for main line ports and safeties too.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.960
Or also outside or safeties as maybe.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.960
But some stuff just doesn't apply.

10:20.960 --> 10:31.960
So, for example, since you're a possible reference device of the same of that of the of the year, for example, like twenty three, then to to Sony open devices.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.960
Most of the work can be used for any other Sony device of that year.

10:34.960 --> 10:49.960
So, for example, I post personally, I put the highland high end Sony devices and I can either test the same comment when I work on the device or just have to change a little bit and then import it from from the yellow repositories.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
That's why there's so much shared.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.960
It's like ninety five percent of the port is the same as on the other port.

10:55.960 --> 11:02.960
It's just there's different testing and so in the end there's more work, but it's really shared really much.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.960
So we can see a timer somewhere.

11:05.960 --> 11:06.960
Oh, sorry.

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
So we have to process.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.960
I really am.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
Yeah.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.960
Yeah.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
Okay.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
I tried to speed up a little bit.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
Sorry.

11:16.960 --> 11:27.960
And then the infrastructure can also be used and then also the issue tracking can be done similar to the yellow ports and the change.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.960
So, yeah.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.960
Okay.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.960
I just tried.

11:35.960 --> 11:41.960
So I'm not sure if I can cover all of this, but I will try.

11:41.960 --> 11:49.960
Yeah. So you're not just about to track down or on internal issue tracking and then regenerate to change works from that.

11:49.960 --> 12:01.960
But we can do the same with GitHub and then generate some change looks with DNF and then have a markdown based change lock that is based from that.

12:01.960 --> 12:21.960
So you take down you close an issue on GitHub and then we generate change lock for the app package and then with DNF report if we scrap the difference between the repositories down from that and then have a change lock from that which looks really good.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.960
And yeah.

12:25.960 --> 12:35.960
And I think it really helps to just contribute and test stuff. So that's why a lot of people that are not programmers to still contribute and it really helps much.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.960
So, yeah.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
Yeah. Okay. That's my last bit.

12:40.960 --> 12:49.960
Yeah. And then the last thing is right now the community doesn't build the enriched parts on the obvious that adaptation.

12:49.960 --> 13:03.960
But for some work with some scripts that I have you can do that locally using the obvious and then upload the binaries which is a lot cleaner than doing this with hard work done because you just have always a clean environment just takes more resources a little bit.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.960
Yeah.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.960
So how much time there for questions though.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
Thank you very much. Yeah.

13:12.960 --> 13:17.960
Yeah. Thank you.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.960
One minute for questions. So any questions. Yeah.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
Yeah. You.

13:25.960 --> 13:36.960
Yeah.

13:36.960 --> 13:53.960
So we have. So I assume that's in your lobby generate like the technical change locks where sister all changes in them in there they are generated and then we have like a manual change like we have to learn over you for like the non-technical people and that's what's the idea about it.

13:53.960 --> 13:59.960
So you should still look into it if it's like exactly as you want it and not just take it. Okay.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.960
Yeah.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.960
Yeah.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.960
Hello Ellen. Yeah. Thank you.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.960
We should do two small clarifications. Yeah.

14:12.960 --> 14:20.960
Was regarding the fact that it's easy to port to other devices because all Sony devices is one.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.960
Yeah. Yeah. I should have said. Yeah.

14:24.960 --> 14:42.960
So the reason why I didn't mention it and I thought this was a sort of thing.

14:42.960 --> 14:56.960
We are just some country one contribution anyone can call report box and so that's why anyone can do it. It's open. It's just there on GitHub and you can fork it and then contribute and then make a product question that's really it.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.960
Yeah. Okay.

14:58.960 --> 15:11.960
Time is basically up. So thank you very much. I will be also also on the also through him if you have more questions and then later I will also understand. So in case you have more questions you can just ask and I didn't have to put a link here.

15:11.960 --> 15:28.960
I've got to put a link here. Sorry. But I will post my slides and I will have the reference on the slides and you can just find our project on GitHub and the Sony on device project of course also GitHub and just create a back there and ask really that's really the only thing that you have to do to get help.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.960
Yeah.

15:31.960 --> 16:00.960
Thank you.
