1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.940
Okay, the room is full.

2
0:00:06.940 --> 0:00:10.100
It's still one minute to go, but I think we can get started.

3
0:00:10.100 --> 0:00:13.700
Welcome, Evangelos, what's new in the world of Foch.

4
0:00:13.700 --> 0:00:20.860
He is a Mobian member, Pearson employee, so he knows what he's talking about.

5
0:00:20.860 --> 0:00:21.860
So welcome.

6
0:00:21.860 --> 0:00:22.860
Yes.

7
0:00:22.860 --> 0:00:30.520
Yes.

8
0:00:30.520 --> 0:00:33.400
Welcome to my talk and thank you for the nice words.

9
0:00:33.400 --> 0:00:36.880
We'll see whether I really know what I'm talking about or not.

10
0:00:36.880 --> 0:00:39.760
Maybe you can correct me if I speak over.

11
0:00:39.760 --> 0:00:42.280
I'm kidding.

12
0:00:42.280 --> 0:00:52.040
Since you already did the introductions, there's not much that needs adding right now.

13
0:00:52.040 --> 0:01:00.520
So you, I'm not sure, since I'm interested, how many people here in this room, maybe by

14
0:01:00.520 --> 0:01:05.880
show of hands, are currently running a Linux first phone?

15
0:01:05.880 --> 0:01:08.800
Okay, that's nice.

16
0:01:08.800 --> 0:01:12.720
I mean you're in the right room then.

17
0:01:12.720 --> 0:01:16.720
And out of those people, how many people are running Foch?

18
0:01:16.720 --> 0:01:21.080
Okay, that's like, I guess half of it or something.

19
0:01:21.080 --> 0:01:22.560
That's great.

20
0:01:22.560 --> 0:01:24.520
Okay.

21
0:01:24.520 --> 0:01:30.320
So yeah, what is Foch for those of you who might not know?

22
0:01:30.320 --> 0:01:39.720
It's a graphical shell for Wayland and it's aimed at mobile devices, so you can use it

23
0:01:39.720 --> 0:01:42.920
with touch-based inputs.

24
0:01:42.920 --> 0:01:54.240
The UI is written in GTK and we'll get back to that later on why that is really nice that

25
0:01:54.240 --> 0:01:57.080
it's written in GTK.

26
0:01:57.080 --> 0:02:07.600
And maybe just as a short history, originally Foch started its life on the Librem 5 and

27
0:02:07.600 --> 0:02:21.200
the Pure S distribution developed by Purism, which heavily invested in getting the GNOME-based

28
0:02:21.200 --> 0:02:28.320
mobile software ecosystem starting, I would say.

29
0:02:28.320 --> 0:02:30.840
And oops.

30
0:02:30.840 --> 0:02:39.240
So while it originally was written with the Librem 5 in mind, it quickly spread to other

31
0:02:39.240 --> 0:02:47.480
distributions and now also runs on a lot of different devices as well as if you saw the

32
0:02:47.480 --> 0:02:48.680
other talks.

33
0:02:48.680 --> 0:02:56.680
For example, our most talked by Mobian, you see that there's like Pinephone, PinephonePro,

34
0:02:56.680 --> 0:03:01.400
all the Pocophone and so on.

35
0:03:01.400 --> 0:03:11.400
And maybe one thing that bears noting is all of these projects, they are working really

36
0:03:11.400 --> 0:03:21.560
great together from my perspective as like upstream for some of the projects.

37
0:03:21.560 --> 0:03:28.920
And it's really great to see all this cross-pollination going on between the different projects and

38
0:03:28.920 --> 0:03:31.880
distributions.

39
0:03:31.880 --> 0:03:38.560
So now to what has happened in the last year.

40
0:03:38.560 --> 0:03:48.600
I guess most notably is the swiping gestures that was implemented.

41
0:03:48.600 --> 0:03:56.520
So you can see in the video, for example, how it really tracks your finger movement

42
0:03:56.520 --> 0:04:01.920
and it looks very nice.

43
0:04:01.920 --> 0:04:10.360
And yeah, that is already probably old news to some of the people here in this room, but

44
0:04:10.360 --> 0:04:19.200
I think that was one of the greatest improvements in terms of usability because you at least

45
0:04:19.200 --> 0:04:28.240
if you're anything like me, you would always accidentally open up the app drawer because

46
0:04:28.240 --> 0:04:34.920
when you were aiming for the space key and you just went the one pixel below that.

47
0:04:34.920 --> 0:04:39.360
Yeah, so gone are those days.

48
0:04:39.360 --> 0:04:45.040
Well from that there's been a bunch of quality of life improvements.

49
0:04:45.040 --> 0:04:54.920
You got, for example, you can turn on and off VPN in the quick settings.

50
0:04:54.920 --> 0:05:02.040
The quick settings are actually now also accessible from the lock screen itself.

51
0:05:02.040 --> 0:05:11.520
And there's been all sorts of design overhauls and making sure the buttons and everything

52
0:05:11.520 --> 0:05:20.760
look really nice thanks to the people that work on design and so on.

53
0:05:20.760 --> 0:05:27.240
Another thing that I find really enjoyable to use are the lock screen plugins.

54
0:05:27.240 --> 0:05:34.400
So you can have plugins to put some widgetry onto your lock screen.

55
0:05:34.400 --> 0:05:41.960
So in these examples you see a simple proof of concept calendar widget, like the one on

56
0:05:41.960 --> 0:05:47.240
the left that is probably not that useful unless you just happen to forget the date

57
0:05:47.240 --> 0:05:50.600
and then it's great.

58
0:05:50.600 --> 0:05:57.120
Upcoming events is something that I really enjoy because yeah, you see at a glance what

59
0:05:57.120 --> 0:05:59.840
is going on next.

60
0:05:59.840 --> 0:06:07.480
Emergency information is also something that you can have displayed there.

61
0:06:07.480 --> 0:06:17.160
And also, notably, if you want to show tickets when the train conductor comes by, you can

62
0:06:17.160 --> 0:06:22.220
do that from the comfort of your lock screen.

63
0:06:22.220 --> 0:06:33.640
You can actually turn on or off these plugins in the Foch Mobile settings application, which

64
0:06:33.640 --> 0:06:43.040
has a few different things you can, like plugins you can enable or disable and other settings

65
0:06:43.040 --> 0:06:51.240
like well, you want the keypad on the lock screen to shuffle whenever it's there.

66
0:06:51.240 --> 0:06:59.560
So no spying eyes can learn your pin from watching unless they watch really, really

67
0:06:59.560 --> 0:07:04.840
closely then.

68
0:07:04.840 --> 0:07:11.920
This is some more images from the mobile settings application.

69
0:07:11.920 --> 0:07:20.000
So for one, you might find some device-specific things there.

70
0:07:20.000 --> 0:07:28.760
And in the compositor settings, which is also shown in the video on the right, you can,

71
0:07:28.760 --> 0:07:41.640
for example, enable scaling applications with windows that are overflowing down to have

72
0:07:41.640 --> 0:07:49.880
them fit on your small mobile screen.

73
0:07:49.880 --> 0:08:00.760
Then we also have a nice thing that came about while at DevConf in Kosovo where it was really

74
0:08:00.760 --> 0:08:02.680
nice weather.

75
0:08:02.680 --> 0:08:17.240
And the main developer implemented automatic high contrast switching between the dark and

76
0:08:17.240 --> 0:08:25.840
light variants based on what the ambient light sensor would show you.

77
0:08:25.840 --> 0:08:34.880
And if you want to try that out currently, you would need to use these G settings.

78
0:08:34.880 --> 0:08:46.760
You may need to adjust the threshold for your case and to make sure that it works for you.

79
0:08:46.760 --> 0:08:56.440
And, yeah, depending on how sunny it exactly is.

80
0:08:56.440 --> 0:09:09.880
Apart from that, I am, yeah, there were a few design overhauls on the calls side.

81
0:09:09.880 --> 0:09:20.600
And also maybe notably to people who have large call history, it starts up a lot faster

82
0:09:20.600 --> 0:09:23.360
than it used to.

83
0:09:23.360 --> 0:09:29.240
And also the scrolling performance in the history has much improved.

84
0:09:29.240 --> 0:09:37.160
It will get even better with GTK4, which is on the roadmap, but with GTK3 resulting to

85
0:09:37.160 --> 0:09:48.920
some hack limiting the amount of widgets displayed in the list box makes a lot of difference,

86
0:09:48.920 --> 0:09:56.040
especially on weaker hardware like the PinePhone itself.

87
0:09:56.040 --> 0:10:06.880
And you can also, I don't know if you are aware, but you can long press the entries

88
0:10:06.880 --> 0:10:12.680
in the call history and from there you can start sending, for example, a new SMS or if

89
0:10:12.680 --> 0:10:18.240
it's an unknown number added to the contacts and so on.

90
0:10:18.240 --> 0:10:31.640
Apart from that, oh, that image should have, yeah, okay, not been there, but, yeah, it's

91
0:10:31.640 --> 0:10:41.640
also, it can also be used to make voiceover IP calls using the session initiation protocol.

92
0:10:41.640 --> 0:10:48.320
That's been implemented some time ago and it should work for you.

93
0:10:48.320 --> 0:10:53.760
So if you have a, I don't know, jump chat or SIP gate or something account, you can

94
0:10:53.760 --> 0:11:01.120
use that for phone calls, sorry, voiceover IP calls.

95
0:11:01.120 --> 0:11:12.280
And during last year supporting encrypted media streams is also something that has landed.

96
0:11:12.280 --> 0:11:18.600
Actually the call display will not tell you right now that it's an encrypted call, but

97
0:11:18.600 --> 0:11:24.560
you can trust me on that.

98
0:11:24.560 --> 0:11:34.960
On the chatty side, like the SMS application, or SMS and more I should rather say, there

99
0:11:34.960 --> 0:11:45.520
was a lot of work on MMS especially thanks to having MMSD.

100
0:11:45.520 --> 0:11:56.040
There was a lot of work on group messaging flows and there's also work still ongoing

101
0:11:56.040 --> 0:12:05.440
on Matrix, but that is something that I'm personally very excited about.

102
0:12:05.440 --> 0:12:13.440
Then maybe in the wider ecosystem, one of the things in GNOME that I really enjoyed

103
0:12:13.440 --> 0:12:22.400
is that we now have dark style preferences with latest Libadvaita and also in Lipendi.

104
0:12:22.400 --> 0:12:30.680
If you want to know more, you can, I guess you can't click on the links, but if you go

105
0:12:30.680 --> 0:12:38.480
to the slides, there's some blog posts that I linked right here.

106
0:12:38.480 --> 0:12:46.840
Maybe just a few examples of some of the applications that have been made adaptive since I think

107
0:12:46.840 --> 0:12:53.120
pretty much all of the GNOME cause applications are now adaptive.

108
0:12:53.120 --> 0:13:03.520
Yeah, contacts, GNOME software, and there's lots of things to look forward to.

109
0:13:03.520 --> 0:13:08.480
So that's Matrix and chatty is one of them.

110
0:13:08.480 --> 0:13:15.040
And yeah, fixing paper cuts because I think we're in a position with Fosh right now where

111
0:13:15.040 --> 0:13:24.320
it's as it was evident by all the people raising their hands earlier that is in good shape.

112
0:13:24.320 --> 0:13:31.960
There's still things that could be better, but it's definitely usable as a daily driver-ish.

113
0:13:31.960 --> 0:13:35.520
Okay.

114
0:13:35.520 --> 0:13:42.320
And yeah, if you want to reach out, look at the slides and thank you.

115
0:13:42.320 --> 0:13:50.240
Three minutes for questions, plenty of time.

116
0:13:50.240 --> 0:13:51.240
Yes.

117
0:13:51.240 --> 0:14:05.680
Okay, is there a mechanism available to display GTK port compliance on the notification?

118
0:14:05.680 --> 0:14:10.120
I don't think there is.

119
0:14:10.120 --> 0:14:19.680
If you look at the, or maybe I'm wrong, but if you look at the notifications, specification,

120
0:14:19.680 --> 0:14:31.000
I'm not sure that you can put like real widgets on with all the bells and whistles.

121
0:14:31.000 --> 0:14:37.560
You can tell that there's, or as an application, you can say, hey, here's an action.

122
0:14:37.560 --> 0:14:45.000
So the notification will give you some button to click on, which will then, I don't know,

123
0:14:45.000 --> 0:14:48.040
do something, reply to a message or something.

124
0:14:48.040 --> 0:14:58.280
But I don't think custom widgetry would work at all because you'd also need, how would

125
0:14:58.280 --> 0:15:00.640
that work?

126
0:15:00.640 --> 0:15:04.800
Like if it's a QT app and yeah.

127
0:15:04.800 --> 0:15:20.560
Probably embedding that in the way that surface is complicated, but I mean, it's, I mean,

128
0:15:20.560 --> 0:15:29.120
it's, it's already built on GTK, so maybe.

129
0:15:29.120 --> 0:15:36.200
I mean, probably since it's free software, there's always ways you could do things, but

130
0:15:36.200 --> 0:15:43.160
I personally, I'm not entirely sure how, how exactly you would implement something like

131
0:15:43.160 --> 0:15:44.160
this.

132
0:15:44.160 --> 0:15:45.160
Yes.

133
0:15:45.160 --> 0:15:46.160
Okay.

134
0:15:46.160 --> 0:15:47.160
I have a question.

135
0:15:47.160 --> 0:15:56.160
In the convergence mode, you have the application list there and it would be great if you can

136
0:15:56.160 --> 0:16:02.360
press some button or get to something and say, make this application now running in

137
0:16:02.360 --> 0:16:07.360
full screen on the external device, external screen or low-class.

138
0:16:07.360 --> 0:16:11.840
Maybe there is, there is supercating some combinations.

139
0:16:11.840 --> 0:16:12.840
Yeah.

140
0:16:12.840 --> 0:16:18.320
Have you made some of the keyboard to be able to connect the phone and say this one is.

141
0:16:18.320 --> 0:16:19.320
Okay.

142
0:16:19.320 --> 0:16:22.680
You mean like from the, when launching the application.

143
0:16:22.680 --> 0:16:27.560
From when there is already running applications.

144
0:16:27.560 --> 0:16:28.560
Okay.

145
0:16:28.560 --> 0:16:29.560
Yeah.

146
0:16:29.560 --> 0:16:40.360
I'm not sure how like from the spatial model of you, since you already have these swipes

147
0:16:40.360 --> 0:16:49.200
to the, to the right and left to go between the, the open applications, I'm not sure like

148
0:16:49.200 --> 0:16:50.200
how would you need to.

149
0:16:50.200 --> 0:16:53.160
I see a group press and some menu.

150
0:16:53.160 --> 0:16:54.160
Ah, okay.

151
0:16:54.160 --> 0:16:55.160
Yeah.

152
0:16:55.160 --> 0:16:57.560
That's quite missing form.

153
0:16:57.560 --> 0:16:58.680
Okay.

154
0:16:58.680 --> 0:17:01.200
That's good to know.

155
0:17:01.200 --> 0:17:02.520
Please file a bucket.

156
0:17:02.520 --> 0:17:03.520
Okay.

157
0:17:03.520 --> 0:17:05.520
So basically time is up.

158
0:17:05.520 --> 0:17:06.520
Sorry.

159
0:17:06.520 --> 0:17:07.520
Sorry.

160
0:17:07.520 --> 0:17:08.520
We only have very little time for this.

161
0:17:08.520 --> 0:17:21.680
It's just already, it already went through, baby.

162
0:17:21.680 --> 0:17:26.800
Okay.
