WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
So we start with a pretty tight schedule.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.840
So thank you everyone for being here and being on time.

00:11.840 --> 00:17.000
So with respect to your time, we're not completely sure we've got the AV all set up for the remote

00:17.000 --> 00:21.800
stream but for those here in the room we'll start it off and post slides.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.320
A bit of housekeeping I guess.

00:24.320 --> 00:30.000
We've got like to say a very full schedule between today and tomorrow.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Today just today.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.760
I'm still going tomorrow to the public.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.760
Tomorrow's a flight but anyhow.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.160
So Alexis you want to walk us quickly through it and then tell us the rest of the housekeeping

00:41.160 --> 00:47.080
stuff and then I'll talk with an overview of the SBOM stuff quickly.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
Right.

00:49.080 --> 00:57.280
So first of all for us, for the strange people who do not know us, this is Kate the Magnificent,

00:57.280 --> 01:03.200
Adolfo the Great is somewhere trying to find AV solutions and I'm Alexis.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Right.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.200
In the program that you have seen we did not do a nice job like other dev rooms and did

01:11.200 --> 01:17.520
we not leave any time between the end of one talk and the start of the other.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.240
Or if you're speaking imagine that you've got five minutes stripped off because we're

01:23.240 --> 01:32.400
going to finish early and switch laptops and bring the next period around.

01:32.400 --> 01:38.400
So as you've seen we have lots of talks all about SBOMs.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
Right.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Okay.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
Okay.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
Okay good.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
I can't speak even.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.400
This is.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Okay.

01:45.400 --> 01:49.080
Okay.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.080
So we have lots of things about SBOMs.

01:52.080 --> 02:03.240
We try to group the presentations according to a couple of themes and so we'll be starting

02:03.240 --> 02:09.440
with more tools that are working on SBOMs.

02:09.440 --> 02:16.240
Then we're going to be discussing what information goes into SBOMs and then we're going to have

02:16.240 --> 02:19.560
more general discussions about SBOMs.

02:19.560 --> 02:26.720
There are two, we had interesting changes in the schedule according to travel plans

02:26.720 --> 02:28.240
for different people.

02:28.240 --> 02:34.480
So we have two discussions or panels or whatever you want to call them.

02:34.480 --> 02:41.800
One is on discussion on SBOM content where we expect people to contribute.

02:41.800 --> 02:49.000
And the other end is the larger panel discussion about, why should it be content there?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.920
Useful and caveat of SBOMs in general.

02:52.920 --> 02:59.840
And then we also have another time slot for everyone to ask questions about SBOMs because

02:59.840 --> 03:02.240
this is something completely new.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.680
And that's about it.

03:04.680 --> 03:10.840
And I give it to Kate to explain what SBOMs is.

03:10.840 --> 03:15.680
The other thing too is as we are moving through the day, if more people are coming in, you

03:15.680 --> 03:20.360
may be getting asked to move that way so that as people come in they can get seated.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.920
And so you'll see myself, one of us, basically we start to see pressure.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.800
Too many people standing in the back of the walls go at some point in time quietly during

03:28.800 --> 03:29.800
the meetings.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
So I think that's it.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.120
Plus the room has a corridor at the end after the...

03:34.120 --> 03:35.120
At the back, yeah.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.560
So you don't need to cross all the...

03:37.560 --> 03:39.280
Okay, so quick show of hands.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.760
How many people have started working with SBOMs already?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.920
Okay.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.920
Pretty good.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.920
So why don't you not up?

03:47.920 --> 03:52.080
So I'm going to just sort of say, the common understanding that's emerged of what an SBOM

03:52.080 --> 03:58.160
is, is the relationships between components used in building software.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.480
And these are like libraries, module, open source, or proprietary, widely available or

04:04.480 --> 04:05.480
restricted.

04:05.480 --> 04:08.320
All of these are valid use cases today.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
And we have to...

04:09.320 --> 04:12.320
Because we have to work full ecosystem and improve transparency, we need to be inclusive

04:12.320 --> 04:14.400
of all of them.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.280
This is a definition that's sort of been worked up in the industry through various meetings

04:19.280 --> 04:24.640
and there's been European participation as well as North American and Japanese.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.480
So we're trying to get this.

04:26.480 --> 04:31.480
There was a document published last year, actually it was the year before, saying what

04:31.480 --> 04:33.720
the minimum elements are.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.760
And the minimum elements are a supplier component name, version of the component, some other

04:37.760 --> 04:43.440
unique identifier, dependency relationships, authors of the data, and timestamp.

04:43.440 --> 04:47.800
That is pretty much all that is asked for for the minimum.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.600
Now anyone who's working with this stuff, it's not sufficient.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.800
So there are a couple of formats that are already recognized as supporting this minimum.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.440
SPDX and Cyclone DX are on that list as well as SWID.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.640
And so we have a definition set of the fields from that things and we're trying to line

05:06.640 --> 05:09.720
up with that in the various formats, okay?

05:09.720 --> 05:13.480
And then possibly do a lot more.

05:13.480 --> 05:19.800
Most of us here are in the SPDX community and it is able to extend beyond that minimum

05:19.800 --> 05:25.280
and we are an international standard and have gone through the effort of becoming an international

05:25.280 --> 05:26.280
standard.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.360
So you'll be hearing probably a little bit more SPDX than the other one but there are

05:30.360 --> 05:34.920
other people working on Cyclone DX who will be here today too.

05:34.920 --> 05:40.080
The context though is an S-bomb by that minimum definition can apply pretty much anywhere

05:40.080 --> 05:40.640
in the software-to-

05:40.640 --> 05:42.480
Like cycle.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.880
And we were finding a lot of people talking past each other.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.600
And so one of the things that's been working on in a group for the last six months is coming

05:51.600 --> 05:55.880
up with a common set of definitions about the types of S-bombs.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.600
And they sort of relate a little bit to where the things are in the design phase but not

05:59.600 --> 06:00.600
completely.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.320
But the common ones that we see out there in the industry right now are the source ones

06:05.320 --> 06:08.000
and the build.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.680
And the build is where we're getting a lot of information for the security folks.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.920
The analyze is when you have a tool that basically gives you a binary and tries to figure out

06:14.920 --> 06:17.120
what's in it.

06:17.120 --> 06:21.280
The deploy is you've got things that you're putting on a system with configuration information

06:21.280 --> 06:23.040
and you want to know that.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.720
And then runtime is what might be running on your system.

06:24.720 --> 06:29.240
You can generate S-bombs for all these sets that fit the minimum definition.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.640
And so one of the things I'm going to be asking the speakers to do is as they are talking

06:33.640 --> 06:37.040
through their slides and everything else if they could say what type of S-bombs they're

06:37.040 --> 06:42.280
talking about so that people can get it clear in their head how these tools work with different

06:42.280 --> 06:44.520
types of data.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.520
And with that I will turn it over to our first speaker.
