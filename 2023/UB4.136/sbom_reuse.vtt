00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Next up, Ryu.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.280
Hello, everybody.

00:15.280 --> 00:25.720
Can everybody hear me okay in the back?

00:25.720 --> 00:27.720
Then I'll speak up like this, okay?

00:27.720 --> 00:30.720
Perfect.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.720
I'm going to give a talk about Ryu's.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.720
I'm Linus.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.720
I work for the Free Software Foundation Europe as a sysadmin,

00:36.720 --> 00:42.720
and I'm also one of the maintainers of the Ryu's tool.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.720
Since this is the S-bomb devroom,

00:48.720 --> 00:52.720
I need to relate what we do with Ryu's to S-bomb somehow.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.720
I think the catchphrase, or what I want you to take away from this presentation today,

00:56.720 --> 01:01.720
is that if you want to have nice S-bomb downstream,

01:01.720 --> 01:04.720
you should push everybody to use Ryu's upstream,

01:04.720 --> 01:07.720
because it makes everything else much, much easier,

01:07.720 --> 01:11.720
or just how Ryu's makes everybody's life a bit easier.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.720
So typically with free and open source software,

01:15.720 --> 01:20.720
you have compliance issues when it comes to license and copyright.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.720
There's missing information about license and copyright holders

01:25.720 --> 01:29.720
of your own code and of third-party code that you might use in your application.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.720
There's license ambiguity.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.720
So for example, if there's just, it says GPL,

01:35.720 --> 01:37.720
but you don't know which version.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.720
Often, when there's somebody taking the time to put all the information there,

01:42.720 --> 01:47.720
it's stored in a silo, and it's not actually where the code is.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.720
Often, another thing is that when you change something in the code,

01:53.720 --> 01:55.720
or you have a new contributor coming on,

01:55.720 --> 01:58.720
then you need to change everything again.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.720
Developers also need a lot of training if there's custom solutions,

02:02.720 --> 02:06.720
and there might also be conflicting compliance practices.

02:06.720 --> 02:14.720
So we thought, why can't we solve these issues here, up the stream,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.720
so that when the water flows down to everybody else

02:17.720 --> 02:21.720
who's consuming license and copyright information of source code

02:21.720 --> 02:26.720
has just an easier time digesting them.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.720
So reuse is based on a couple of principles.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.720
It should be easy for copyright and licensing information.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.720
Everybody should be able to find this easily,

02:37.720 --> 02:41.720
so it should be in the file that it applies to, if that's possible.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.720
Of course, with a binary file, that's not possible,

02:43.720 --> 02:48.720
but if it's plain text, that's possible, and then it should go in there.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.720
Silos should be avoided, and all the licensing copyright information

02:52.720 --> 02:54.720
should be stored in the repo.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.720
And that info should be readable by humans and machines alike.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.720
We also do not want to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to,

03:02.720 --> 03:08.720
so we try to be as compatible as possible.

03:08.720 --> 03:14.720
And also, licensing should be easy and fun.

03:14.720 --> 03:22.720
And yeah, so we try to do that.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.720
You can decide whether we manage, but at least we try.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.720
So there are three simple steps to using reuse.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.720
First, you choose and provide the license.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.720
Reuse does it with a nice little dialogue for you

03:35.720 --> 03:37.720
when you start it up the first time.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
I can show you later.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.720
Then you add copyright and licensing information,

03:42.720 --> 03:44.720
preferably to every file.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.720
And then we have a range of tooling that allows you to confirm

03:49.720 --> 03:52.720
this reuse compliance, either in a pre-commit hook, in CI,

03:52.720 --> 03:56.720
and of course locally on your machine.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.720
So I'll go through this quick, maybe just a quick show of hands.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.720
Who has heard of reuse before?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.720
Okay, so I'm preaching to the choir.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.720
Who has used it before?

04:08.720 --> 04:17.720
Okay, so I'll go through this rather quickly.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.720
One thing that we do is we save license text in a licenses directory.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.720
I'll make a quick shout-out to GitHub later about this.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.720
Then reuse names them after the SPDX license identifier,

04:31.720 --> 04:35.720
and then they're stored in the licenses repository.

04:35.720 --> 04:40.720
Then the copyright and license information is added to every file.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.720
Then it looks roughly like that.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.720
And then if you have uncommentable files,

04:48.720 --> 04:54.720
like binary files, images, or executables or whatever,

04:54.720 --> 04:58.720
then you can do a separate license file, which is a plain text file,

04:58.720 --> 05:01.720
which refers back to that uncommentable file,

05:01.720 --> 05:04.720
which then contains this information.

05:04.720 --> 05:10.720
And there's also you can use a depth5 file in.reuse directory.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.720
This is about to change soon, hopefully,

05:13.720 --> 05:16.720
because we are going to develop our own reuse.yaml,

05:16.720 --> 05:19.720
which sits at the root of the repository,

05:19.720 --> 05:24.720
where you can define this type of information for uncommentable files

05:24.720 --> 05:29.720
or for whole directories much easier than with depth5.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.720
And then the third step is you confirm that you're actually compliant

05:33.720 --> 05:35.720
with reuse.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.720
One of the components of reuse,

05:39.720 --> 05:42.720
so one thing is a spec,

05:42.720 --> 05:47.720
where we pretty clearly try to state how licensing information

05:47.720 --> 05:51.720
and copyright information should be added to source code.

05:51.720 --> 05:57.720
Then there's a helper tool, the reuse tool, the reuse CLI tool.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.720
Then there's a very good tutorial in FAQ

06:00.720 --> 06:04.720
that you can look into to answer very basic questions about licensing,

06:04.720 --> 06:07.720
but also some advanced stuff.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.720
And then there's an API where you can sign up your project

06:10.720 --> 06:12.720
and then get a nice badge.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.720
Who doesn't like badges?

06:15.720 --> 06:20.720
So I've already said that we store the licenses in the licenses directory,

06:20.720 --> 06:24.720
so the UI of GitHub, for example, still doesn't pick that up properly.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.720
That would be very cool if that happens. It's not very hard.

06:28.720 --> 06:35.720
And the rest of that, in the interest of time, I'll skip over that.

06:35.720 --> 06:40.720
So now I'll just show you really, really quick,

06:40.720 --> 06:44.720
because I have five minutes left, I think,

06:44.720 --> 06:50.720
how this works and how this works in practice.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.720
So here is the text size okay for everybody in the back.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.720
So here I'm in a non-compliant repo,

06:58.720 --> 07:01.720
and I can run reuse-linn to confirm that I'm not compliant.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
I have six files in this repo,

07:02.720 --> 07:05.720
none of them have any copyright or licensing information.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
That's not cool.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.720
So I can just run reuse in it.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.720
And now I'm asked to provide licenses,

07:12.720 --> 07:20.720
so usually I use something like CCO 1.0

07:20.720 --> 07:26.720
for configuration files and stuff like that.

07:26.720 --> 07:36.720
Then we could, let's add GPL.

07:36.720 --> 07:46.720
And then, did you mean I, GPL?

07:46.720 --> 07:52.720
And just call that example. That doesn't matter.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.720
So now we see it downloaded the licenses

07:55.720 --> 07:57.720
and it created a file file for us.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.720
Like I said, this will change.

07:59.720 --> 08:05.720
And now I can start adding license information to certain files.

08:05.720 --> 08:10.720
So for example, now I can add the license CC0 to my gitignore file,

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
for example.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.720
I can run reuse-linn to see what's changed.

08:14.720 --> 08:20.720
And I see now I have one file with correct copyright information.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.720
And I could now continue doing that for the rest of the files,

08:23.720 --> 08:28.720
but I hope this, you get the idea that it's a tool

08:28.720 --> 08:30.720
that really simplifies this process.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.720
And then you can put the reuse-linn checks in your pre-commit hooks.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.720
They're very terse.

08:36.720 --> 08:41.720
They basically look like this.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.720
That's all you have to do and then run pre-commit install

08:46.720 --> 08:50.720
and then before you commit, it does the reuse-linn check.

08:50.720 --> 08:56.720
So it's very, very simple. It's very straightforward.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.720
I had to jump through this a little bit because I don't have that much time.

09:00.720 --> 09:01.720
I just realized.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.720
So the ongoing development is of course the tool

09:04.720 --> 09:08.720
and it's all free and open source.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.720
And so you can contribute as much as you'd like.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.720
And we're very happy about everybody who contributes.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.720
And then there's an API,

09:16.720 --> 09:20.720
which is all fully open source and free software.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.720
We have a specification, which will be extended with reuse-linn.yaml

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
really, really soon.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.720
We hope that we can do some better integration,

09:29.720 --> 09:32.720
especially with git forages in the future,

09:32.720 --> 09:36.720
that the UI shows you which licenses you have in the repository right away.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.720
And we want to spread and you can of course help us with that.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
So who uses reuse?

09:42.720 --> 09:46.720
At the moment we have over 1,400 projects signed up

09:46.720 --> 09:53.720
that use our API that have cumulatively more than 80,000 stars on GitHub.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.720
Then there's stuff that lives on other forages like KDE

09:56.720 --> 09:58.720
and the framework that uses reuse.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.720
Curl became reuse-compliant as WebLate,

10:02.720 --> 10:06.720
a really cool translation project that recently became reuse-compliant,

10:06.720 --> 10:08.720
GNU Health Project, which is an awesome project,

10:08.720 --> 10:11.720
the KunaVAN app in Germany,

10:11.720 --> 10:15.720
and the Linux kernel is trying to become reuse-compliant.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.720
It will take a while.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.720
So feel free to check this.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.720
I will upload the slides and then you have all the links.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.720
If you want to participate, sign up to the mailing list,

10:29.720 --> 10:32.720
ask questions, create issues,

10:32.720 --> 10:35.720
make one of your own projects reuse-compliant.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.720
It's really easy.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.720
Integrate reuse into your community and compliance policies.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.720
Help others adopt reuse.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.720
Here I linked the developer section of the website,

10:45.720 --> 10:49.720
which is really the best way to get started really, really quickly.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.720
And yeah, I don't know.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.720
Do I have time for questions?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.720
Two minutes.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.720
Two minutes.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.720
Maybe I can take one.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.720
I also, just a quick note, Carmen is here.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.720
She's one of the main creators of reuse.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.720
So we'll also be happy to answer questions afterwards.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.720
I'll take one now.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.720
What does bad license mean in the Linux?

11:13.720 --> 11:14.720
A bad license?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.720
Yes, the linter shows in the header,

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
the first one is bad licenses.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.720
I think...

11:19.720 --> 11:21.720
It's not an SPDX license.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.720
Ah, yeah, it's not an SPDX license.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.720
What does bad license mean?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.720
What does bad license mean?

11:28.720 --> 11:32.720
And it means that it's not an actual SPDX license.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.720
Yeah, but just on...

11:34.720 --> 11:36.720
How do you handle custom license?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.720
Yes.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.720
I don't think we handle them at all.

11:40.720 --> 11:45.720
You can make a custom license, license ref?

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
Ah, okay.

11:46.720 --> 11:51.720
Yeah, so you can make a custom license ref within SPDX.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.720
So that SPDX allows you to do that,

11:54.720 --> 11:58.720
and we used to follow that.

11:58.720 --> 12:27.720
Yeah, sorry, only 15 minutes.
