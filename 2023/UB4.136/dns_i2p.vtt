00:00.000 --> 00:16.600
Five more seconds so you can start.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.240
Thank you very much for having me.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.680
Do you hear me back there?

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Yes.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
Lovely.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
All right.

00:22.680 --> 00:23.680
Okay.

00:23.680 --> 00:28.000
I'm Konrad, and I have the opposite of problems, and I have a million of problems compared

00:28.000 --> 00:29.240
to Geran.

00:29.240 --> 00:34.160
Because Geran had performance issues, that was the thing before, and he tried to parse

00:34.160 --> 00:37.800
DNS zone files really fast.

00:37.800 --> 00:43.240
In the I2P network, which is an overlay network which provides anonymity, we have that few

00:43.240 --> 00:44.400
hosts.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.080
We don't even need to think about performance.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.400
We have, as I said, one million other problems.

00:49.400 --> 00:55.200
Now, the students of the University of Applied Science got the job from me to take a look

00:55.200 --> 00:59.800
at this DNS problem because the I2P network has no DNS.

00:59.800 --> 01:24.800
So welcome to Stone Age.
