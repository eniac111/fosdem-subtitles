1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Welcome to the final talk.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:08.000
Wow.

3
0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:13.000
So lots of people want to know where to go from here.

4
0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:15.000
Welcome Clayton Craft.

5
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:22.000
We are really happy his plane made it barely despite that weather and all that.

6
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:27.000
So some might know him as Crafty Guy in some chat rooms.

7
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:30.000
Well, I don't need to introduce you here.

8
0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:35.000
So welcome and yeah, happy to have you here.

9
0:00:35.000 --> 0:00:40.000
Thank you.

10
0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:43.000
Yeah, so I'm Clayton, also known as Crafty Guy.

11
0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:47.000
You might recognize me from some of my contributions to post-market OS.

12
0:00:47.000 --> 0:00:50.000
Or you might recognize me from my avatar, right?

13
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:51.000
No?

14
0:00:51.000 --> 0:00:56.000
I started contributing to this distribution back in 2017.

15
0:00:56.000 --> 0:01:00.000
Mainly because it had initial support for the Nokia N900,

16
0:01:00.000 --> 0:01:03.000
which was the first Linux phone I owned.

17
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:09.000
And by 2017, I was really tired of the two options for mobile operating systems.

18
0:01:09.000 --> 0:01:14.000
I wanted something that could run a recent Linux kernel that had a familiar user space

19
0:01:14.000 --> 0:01:20.000
and most importantly wasn't trying to like exfiltrate personal information all the time.

20
0:01:20.000 --> 0:01:23.000
And I still feel that way today, which is why I'm here,

21
0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:27.000
because I think that we as a community need to try to answer the question,

22
0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:29.000
where do we go from here?

23
0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:33.000
Because here today, the situation is quite a bit different

24
0:01:33.000 --> 0:01:37.000
and has improved in some ways from the last few years.

25
0:01:37.000 --> 0:01:41.000
For example, there's a number of phones out there now that can run Linux,

26
0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:44.000
some of them out of the box, which is really exciting.

27
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:47.000
However, when you look at how many phones exist out in the world today,

28
0:01:47.000 --> 0:01:52.000
there's thousands and thousands of them, and only like a small handful can do this.

29
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:55.000
So I think there's some improvement there, obviously.

30
0:01:55.000 --> 0:02:00.000
There's also a lot more distributions, both Linux and, as you saw in the previous talk,

31
0:02:00.000 --> 0:02:04.000
other alternative operating systems that can boot on these phones.

32
0:02:04.000 --> 0:02:11.000
However, I think there's not a whole lot of coordination between distributions today,

33
0:02:11.000 --> 0:02:15.000
because a lot of these distributions are targeting the same hardware.

34
0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:18.000
They also are targeting some of the same use cases.

35
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:21.000
And so a lot of them are trying to solve some of the same problems

36
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:23.000
and have some of the same goals.

37
0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:26.000
And a lot of distributions are kind of doing it on their own

38
0:02:26.000 --> 0:02:31.000
and not really comparing notes and trying to work collaboratively to solve these things

39
0:02:31.000 --> 0:02:35.000
in cases where the work being done to solve the problem

40
0:02:35.000 --> 0:02:38.000
could be used by multiple distros, for instance.

41
0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:43.000
And another exciting thing I think today is there's a lot more applications

42
0:02:43.000 --> 0:02:46.000
that have been created, both with some of the work from Purism

43
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:52.000
and other folks in the community that lets these applications work pretty well

44
0:02:52.000 --> 0:02:54.000
on mobile form factors.

45
0:02:54.000 --> 0:02:58.000
However, when you consider non-technical end-users

46
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:01.000
and what they expect for a modern smartphone,

47
0:03:01.000 --> 0:03:04.000
there's still a lot of missing functionality there.

48
0:03:04.000 --> 0:03:08.000
So again, more room for improvement.

49
0:03:08.000 --> 0:03:12.000
And I think there's a lot of people, both inside and outside the community,

50
0:03:12.000 --> 0:03:15.000
who are really interested in what we're doing.

51
0:03:15.000 --> 0:03:18.000
And I think a lot of them are kind of asking the same questions.

52
0:03:18.000 --> 0:03:22.000
Specifically, one question I think everybody's asking,

53
0:03:22.000 --> 0:03:25.000
no matter who you are, is what's it like, right?

54
0:03:25.000 --> 0:03:29.000
What's it like to have a phone that can run Linux and use it as a daily driver?

55
0:03:29.000 --> 0:03:33.000
What's it like to depend on that for navigation and communication?

56
0:03:33.000 --> 0:03:37.000
And obviously, whoever's asking this is...

57
0:03:37.000 --> 0:03:40.000
The answer to that question depends a lot on who's asking it

58
0:03:40.000 --> 0:03:42.000
and where they're coming from.

59
0:03:42.000 --> 0:03:46.000
For example, an end-user, when they ask, hey, what's it like to use your phone

60
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:52.000
that's running Linux, they want to know, can they message grandma on WhatsApp,

61
0:03:52.000 --> 0:03:56.000
or can they use it to navigate from your hotel to the FOSITM conference,

62
0:03:56.000 --> 0:03:59.000
and stuff like that.

63
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:03.000
I think myself as an OS developer, when I think about this question,

64
0:04:03.000 --> 0:04:08.000
I tend to think about a lot of the problems I run into

65
0:04:08.000 --> 0:04:12.000
with developing and maintaining an operating system on Linux phones,

66
0:04:12.000 --> 0:04:16.000
and how a lot of these problems, again, are shared between distributions

67
0:04:16.000 --> 0:04:20.000
because, again, we're targeting a lot of the same hardware and use cases.

68
0:04:20.000 --> 0:04:25.000
And I think about how hard it is today to create or solve problems

69
0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:33.000
that can be reused by other distributions without a whole lot of rework on their part.

70
0:04:33.000 --> 0:04:38.000
A good recent example of this is a Libram 5 user, Chris Vogel, last week

71
0:04:38.000 --> 0:04:42.000
was trying to work around a problem on the Libram 5,

72
0:04:42.000 --> 0:04:47.000
and he created some patches for this work around, submitted them to Purism,

73
0:04:47.000 --> 0:04:51.000
and I actually just happened to come across the patches

74
0:04:51.000 --> 0:04:55.000
because I was trying to address the same problem on post-market OS.

75
0:04:55.000 --> 0:04:59.000
And his patches look good from the context of pure OS,

76
0:04:59.000 --> 0:05:02.000
but they were pretty much unusable for me on post-market OS

77
0:05:02.000 --> 0:05:06.000
because of just differences in the distribution, right?

78
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:09.000
His patches were relying heavily on systemd services

79
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:12.000
in order to trigger things to apply workarounds,

80
0:05:12.000 --> 0:05:14.000
and I don't have systemd in post-market OS,

81
0:05:14.000 --> 0:05:17.000
so that was a non-starter right there.

82
0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:21.000
I was able to talk to him and give some tips on how he could redo it

83
0:05:21.000 --> 0:05:26.000
so that it would work across multiple distributions, even ones without systemd.

84
0:05:26.000 --> 0:05:30.000
And I think this is kind of like the current happy situation

85
0:05:30.000 --> 0:05:34.000
where he's off creating something now that could be reused, right?

86
0:05:34.000 --> 0:05:38.000
But I think there's a lot of cases where, because people don't know

87
0:05:38.000 --> 0:05:41.000
there's other distributions or know what they need,

88
0:05:41.000 --> 0:05:44.000
oftentimes people run into problems like this

89
0:05:44.000 --> 0:05:47.000
and they create something which works totally fine for them,

90
0:05:47.000 --> 0:05:53.000
but is not usable or not even known to other distributions with the same problems, right?

91
0:05:53.000 --> 0:05:57.000
So, like, I might end up recreating or redoing a lot of the work,

92
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:00.000
and it's inefficient, right?

93
0:06:00.000 --> 0:06:03.000
I would rather spend the time not solving problems

94
0:06:03.000 --> 0:06:05.000
that have already been solved elsewhere,

95
0:06:05.000 --> 0:06:08.000
but adding new functionality or supporting users

96
0:06:08.000 --> 0:06:14.000
who are using the distribution that I'm helping to develop.

97
0:06:14.000 --> 0:06:18.000
And I think we need a number of things as a community

98
0:06:18.000 --> 0:06:21.000
in order to address some of these inefficiencies

99
0:06:21.000 --> 0:06:26.000
with maintaining distributions that target a lot of the same hardware

100
0:06:26.000 --> 0:06:28.000
and use cases.

101
0:06:28.000 --> 0:06:31.000
It would be really nice if, like, in that previous situation

102
0:06:31.000 --> 0:06:34.000
I just spoke about, there was a place for a developer

103
0:06:34.000 --> 0:06:36.000
like Chris or myself or anyone, right,

104
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:39.000
to ask for feedback directly from the community

105
0:06:39.000 --> 0:06:42.000
and be fairly confident that they're reaching, like, you know,

106
0:06:42.000 --> 0:06:44.000
critical mass of the community, right?

107
0:06:44.000 --> 0:06:48.000
And also where distributions can sort of, like, provide this feedback.

108
0:06:48.000 --> 0:06:51.000
So when people do solve problems that they're experiencing

109
0:06:51.000 --> 0:06:54.000
or when people are trying to implement things

110
0:06:54.000 --> 0:06:56.000
that they could really use,

111
0:06:56.000 --> 0:06:58.000
that they have the opportunity to provide feedback,

112
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:02.000
and, you know, the person doing the work can take or leave the feedback

113
0:07:02.000 --> 0:07:06.000
but at least know that they're getting input or have access to this input

114
0:07:06.000 --> 0:07:09.000
so they can create something that's usable by everyone,

115
0:07:09.000 --> 0:07:13.000
and we don't have these cases where people are just kind of one-off

116
0:07:13.000 --> 0:07:15.000
doing the same thing, right?

117
0:07:15.000 --> 0:07:19.000
I think it would also be really nice if we had, as a community,

118
0:07:19.000 --> 0:07:23.000
a list of priorities that we care about, both, like, goals

119
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:26.000
and also, like, these shared problems.

120
0:07:26.000 --> 0:07:29.000
The main purpose of this is, like, when contributors come along

121
0:07:29.000 --> 0:07:33.000
and they want something to work on or not sure what to do,

122
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:35.000
they could see this list of priorities,

123
0:07:35.000 --> 0:07:37.000
and, you know, if we come up with it as a community,

124
0:07:37.000 --> 0:07:40.000
we can put stuff up there we care about, obviously,

125
0:07:40.000 --> 0:07:43.000
and when people choose to work on these priorities,

126
0:07:43.000 --> 0:07:44.000
then we all benefit, right,

127
0:07:44.000 --> 0:07:48.000
because they're working on things that we said are important to us.

128
0:07:48.000 --> 0:07:51.000
And so, you know, maybe they'll provide some motivation

129
0:07:51.000 --> 0:07:53.000
or inspiration for folks that want to contribute

130
0:07:53.000 --> 0:07:56.000
and aren't necessarily certain how.

131
0:07:56.000 --> 0:08:00.000
And I think by kind of addressing the first two things,

132
0:08:00.000 --> 0:08:05.000
we'll inherently create stronger relationships within the community,

133
0:08:05.000 --> 0:08:08.000
right, between individuals and projects,

134
0:08:08.000 --> 0:08:12.000
and I think that these strong relationships are critical.

135
0:08:12.000 --> 0:08:15.000
Like, if we want to have any chance of convincing, you know,

136
0:08:15.000 --> 0:08:17.000
businesses or governments or what have you,

137
0:08:17.000 --> 0:08:20.000
or even just end users, right, like,

138
0:08:20.000 --> 0:08:23.000
if I want to try to convince, you know,

139
0:08:23.000 --> 0:08:26.000
a new group of users or something to give this a shot,

140
0:08:26.000 --> 0:08:28.000
we need to be somewhat organized

141
0:08:28.000 --> 0:08:31.000
and have an idea for, like, what we're trying to accomplish

142
0:08:31.000 --> 0:08:33.000
and be able to communicate that well externally

143
0:08:33.000 --> 0:08:35.000
so people know what we're all about.

144
0:08:35.000 --> 0:08:39.000
And these strong relationships, I think, are necessary for that,

145
0:08:39.000 --> 0:08:41.000
and, I mean, it's great, like, meeting people here at Fozoom,

146
0:08:41.000 --> 0:08:43.000
but it's, like, very one-off, right,

147
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:45.000
and we need to maintain that,

148
0:08:45.000 --> 0:08:47.000
and I think we maintain that by better organizing

149
0:08:47.000 --> 0:08:50.000
and, you know, trying to implement some of the things here

150
0:08:50.000 --> 0:08:53.000
I think we need.

151
0:08:53.000 --> 0:08:57.000
So I'm here to propose forming a committee.

152
0:08:57.000 --> 0:08:59.000
I'm not even sure if committee is the right word for this,

153
0:08:59.000 --> 0:09:05.000
but bottom line is we need to somehow be more organized than we are.

154
0:09:05.000 --> 0:09:08.000
Not necessarily, like, you know,

155
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:14.000
dictoral or anything like that, but in some ways,

156
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:17.000
at a higher level, just addressing, like, you know,

157
0:09:17.000 --> 0:09:19.000
having a place for people to get feedback,

158
0:09:19.000 --> 0:09:22.000
and I think a committee or some central place

159
0:09:22.000 --> 0:09:24.000
where distributions and projects are represented

160
0:09:24.000 --> 0:09:27.000
could be a place like that.

161
0:09:27.000 --> 0:09:31.000
I also think, like, as a developer,

162
0:09:31.000 --> 0:09:34.000
I'm not necessarily, like, the greatest at communicating

163
0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:36.000
when I'm working on and, like,

164
0:09:36.000 --> 0:09:39.000
what my motivations are for working on this

165
0:09:39.000 --> 0:09:41.000
and what Linux on mobile or Free Software on mobile

166
0:09:41.000 --> 0:09:43.000
will have to offer.

167
0:09:43.000 --> 0:09:47.000
So I think we should also, like, work on our public representation

168
0:09:47.000 --> 0:09:50.000
and having a committee or whatever you want to call it

169
0:09:50.000 --> 0:09:52.000
be sort of the single point for communicating to the world

170
0:09:52.000 --> 0:09:56.000
what we're doing and why we want to do it would be important.

171
0:09:56.000 --> 0:09:58.000
Like, I know why I'm here, right?

172
0:09:58.000 --> 0:10:02.000
I don't want to have a corporate centralized device

173
0:10:02.000 --> 0:10:04.000
that's leaking personal information,

174
0:10:04.000 --> 0:10:06.000
and I want the freedom to hack on this thing

175
0:10:06.000 --> 0:10:09.000
and, you know, do what I want, more or less.

176
0:10:09.000 --> 0:10:12.000
But again, I think a lot of us are developers,

177
0:10:12.000 --> 0:10:14.000
engineers, and we're not necessarily, like,

178
0:10:14.000 --> 0:10:18.000
the best at communicating that to non-technical users specifically.

179
0:10:18.000 --> 0:10:21.000
So I think, you know, having some central thing

180
0:10:21.000 --> 0:10:23.000
where we can kind of work together to create something

181
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:31.000
that can educate the world about us is, you know, nice to have.

182
0:10:31.000 --> 0:10:33.000
Now, I know what you're thinking, like,

183
0:10:33.000 --> 0:10:34.000
who is this guy?

184
0:10:34.000 --> 0:10:39.000
Why would I want some oversight committee thing,

185
0:10:39.000 --> 0:10:41.000
like authority telling me what I can and can't work on

186
0:10:41.000 --> 0:10:42.000
during my free time?

187
0:10:42.000 --> 0:10:44.000
Because I know a lot of people here, myself included,

188
0:10:44.000 --> 0:10:47.000
are working on this during our free time.

189
0:10:47.000 --> 0:10:50.000
And, yeah, the last thing I wanted somebody to be like,

190
0:10:50.000 --> 0:10:52.000
here's the priorities for you.

191
0:10:52.000 --> 0:10:54.000
You know, when are you going to have them done by?

192
0:10:54.000 --> 0:10:56.000
Because that's silly.

193
0:10:56.000 --> 0:11:00.000
And I completely agree that's not the purpose of this.

194
0:11:00.000 --> 0:11:04.000
And the point is, I don't really know what this looks like

195
0:11:04.000 --> 0:11:07.000
when it organizes, but I think we need to organize.

196
0:11:07.000 --> 0:11:09.000
And I created a working group.

197
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:12.000
There's a link to the matrix room on the slide

198
0:11:12.000 --> 0:11:14.000
where I would invite everybody here,

199
0:11:14.000 --> 0:11:17.000
everybody listening online, everybody in this community

200
0:11:17.000 --> 0:11:24.000
to join in, and let's figure out how we can become more organized.

201
0:11:24.000 --> 0:11:29.000
And, oh, I'd like to thank my employer, Agalia,

202
0:11:29.000 --> 0:11:33.000
for sponsoring my travel to come here to give this talk.

203
0:11:33.000 --> 0:11:37.000
And, yeah, any questions, comments, opinions?

204
0:11:37.000 --> 0:11:40.000
Pretty short talk, but...

205
0:11:40.000 --> 0:11:43.000
APPLAUSE

206
0:11:48.000 --> 0:11:51.000
Nothing? Speechless.

207
0:11:51.000 --> 0:11:54.000
Yeah, go ahead.

208
0:11:54.000 --> 0:11:58.000
I was wondering if it's really such a centralized thing

209
0:11:58.000 --> 0:12:03.000
because somehow some mechanism to find,

210
0:12:03.000 --> 0:12:08.000
to find for some issue in other projects

211
0:12:08.000 --> 0:12:13.000
to look at, which might have the issue in common

212
0:12:13.000 --> 0:12:17.000
because you might, for the first time,

213
0:12:17.000 --> 0:12:21.000
copy very different projects.

214
0:12:21.000 --> 0:12:25.000
For example, I start working on the Amazon Uber,

215
0:12:25.000 --> 0:12:34.000
the 200, the glasses, and there are people interested in having a new Android

216
0:12:34.000 --> 0:12:36.000
or something like that on it.

217
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:44.000
And a common thing needed for both,

218
0:12:44.000 --> 0:12:51.000
for whoever should be put on it, is to how to really start hacking it,

219
0:12:51.000 --> 0:12:56.000
how to access, start something, put something on it, and so on.

220
0:12:56.000 --> 0:13:06.000
So maybe there has to be some metrics,

221
0:13:06.000 --> 0:13:14.000
some network built up along which corners issues should travel,

222
0:13:14.000 --> 0:13:20.000
or should manually check if there is some, if that issue is also...

223
0:13:20.000 --> 0:13:27.000
So if I enter an issue, I would like to somehow get a list of other projects

224
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:33.000
where it might also be a event, maybe for issue to find things out,

225
0:13:33.000 --> 0:13:43.000
or maybe to find some partners for mainlining stuff, or so on.

226
0:13:43.000 --> 0:13:45.000
Maybe there's some...

227
0:13:45.000 --> 0:13:54.000
Yeah, that's one of the motivations for why I spent way too much time thinking about this.

228
0:13:54.000 --> 0:13:59.000
For problems like that that exist across distributions and whatever,

229
0:13:59.000 --> 0:14:01.000
it would be nice to know about that.

230
0:14:01.000 --> 0:14:04.000
If you're also trying to work on supporting a new device

231
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:07.000
or improving something in your distro,

232
0:14:07.000 --> 0:14:10.000
and you want to know if other people have had this problem,

233
0:14:10.000 --> 0:14:14.000
and right now it's like you have to know what other distros are out there

234
0:14:14.000 --> 0:14:18.000
who might be working on this thing, and then know where to find information,

235
0:14:18.000 --> 0:14:22.000
and then go search a million different GitLab instances or whatever to figure out,

236
0:14:22.000 --> 0:14:24.000
is this a problem that other people have seen or not?

237
0:14:24.000 --> 0:14:26.000
It's kind of a mess, right?

238
0:14:26.000 --> 0:14:30.000
And the same goes for a lot of other problems I've come across.

239
0:14:30.000 --> 0:14:33.000
So yeah, that's the idea, right?

240
0:14:33.000 --> 0:14:38.000
Have kind of a central place where people can...

241
0:14:38.000 --> 0:14:40.000
Where problems like that can be expressed,

242
0:14:40.000 --> 0:14:43.000
and people who are working on them, no matter what distribution you're in,

243
0:14:43.000 --> 0:14:47.000
can work together on these things.

244
0:14:48.000 --> 0:14:49.000
Yes?

245
0:14:49.000 --> 0:15:17.000
Q&A question?

246
0:15:17.000 --> 0:15:30.000
Q&A question?

247
0:15:30.000 --> 0:15:32.000
Yeah, that's tricky, right?

248
0:15:32.000 --> 0:15:36.000
Because in the desktop world,

249
0:15:36.000 --> 0:15:41.000
there's some focus towards Flatpak and other ways to package the runtime,

250
0:15:41.000 --> 0:15:44.000
so then it kind of doesn't matter what the distro is, right?

251
0:15:44.000 --> 0:15:46.000
Because you can reuse the same runtime,

252
0:15:46.000 --> 0:15:51.000
you can try your application, and you target that thing.

253
0:15:51.000 --> 0:15:54.000
I don't know if that's right for us, but that specific thing,

254
0:15:54.000 --> 0:15:58.000
but I agree there should be a way that people can talk about these things

255
0:15:58.000 --> 0:16:01.000
within these distributions we have.

256
0:16:01.000 --> 0:16:06.000
And I think there's a fine line.

257
0:16:06.000 --> 0:16:09.000
We don't necessarily want to try to...

258
0:16:09.000 --> 0:16:11.000
I like that there's a lot of distributions,

259
0:16:11.000 --> 0:16:13.000
and I like that they're all doing their own thing, right?

260
0:16:13.000 --> 0:16:17.000
Because Post Market OS was started by Ollie for a very specific reason,

261
0:16:17.000 --> 0:16:21.000
and people started Mobian because they wanted to run Debian on their device,

262
0:16:21.000 --> 0:16:25.000
and there's less focus on what the runtimes are there,

263
0:16:25.000 --> 0:16:31.000
but I think it's a good thing that there's so much distro diversity

264
0:16:31.000 --> 0:16:33.000
or whatever within the community,

265
0:16:33.000 --> 0:16:41.000
and I wouldn't really want to try to shoehorn any particular runtime mechanism

266
0:16:41.000 --> 0:16:43.000
or whatever you want to call it.

267
0:16:43.000 --> 0:16:48.000
On the other hand, I know it's hard for application developers, right?

268
0:16:48.000 --> 0:16:51.000
Like as you said.

269
0:16:51.000 --> 0:16:55.000
On the distro plans, for example, you can expect it to have some like you

270
0:16:55.000 --> 0:17:08.620
or GTK or something, and this still is not a given on the

271
0:17:08.620 --> 0:17:11.120
one we got very, very close to.

272
0:17:11.120 --> 0:17:15.620
So would it be nice if you had a way to ask distributions like,

273
0:17:15.620 --> 0:17:19.620
hey, what version of GTK are you running or something, right?

274
0:17:19.620 --> 0:17:22.120
And be able to get input directly from them.

275
0:17:22.120 --> 0:17:25.620
So that way, at least you know like there's the minimum version I need to support.

276
0:17:25.620 --> 0:17:29.120
And I know it's not the ideal situation where you just like support whatever you want,

277
0:17:29.120 --> 0:17:33.120
but yeah, basically the idea is like you'd be able to go and say,

278
0:17:33.120 --> 0:17:40.120
hey, Linux mobile distros, I want to target this version of GTK 4 for this application.

279
0:17:40.120 --> 0:17:46.120
If you care about this application, is there like a version I should look at targeting or something?

280
0:17:46.120 --> 0:17:50.120
And so today, if you wanted to do that, you'd have to like,

281
0:17:50.120 --> 0:17:55.120
you'd have to know what all the distros are that might be interested in using this thing you want to create.

282
0:17:55.120 --> 0:17:57.120
And then you need to know how to contact them.

283
0:17:57.120 --> 0:18:00.120
And even when you do, the people who have an opinion might not even be online

284
0:18:00.120 --> 0:18:04.120
or you know, might not be available or maybe ask the wrong person or something.

285
0:18:04.120 --> 0:18:06.120
So it's not great, right?

286
0:18:06.120 --> 0:18:13.120
See, what I'm proposing is like have a way that you could ask for feedback from all the folks in the community.

287
0:18:13.120 --> 0:18:17.120
And people who care about what you're doing can be like, yeah, here's the version I use.

288
0:18:17.120 --> 0:18:22.120
Or like maybe, you know, maybe this person is like representing their distro

289
0:18:22.120 --> 0:18:26.120
and they take it back to the person who knows that's working on their distro

290
0:18:26.120 --> 0:18:29.120
and then they, you know, give you the answer back or whatever.

291
0:18:29.120 --> 0:18:38.120
So it's a way to convey information basically to and from people who are interested in, you know, solving those problems.

292
0:18:38.120 --> 0:18:39.120
Yes?

293
0:18:39.120 --> 0:19:02.120
I like that you mentioned public representation. I'm not that technical and I'm here out of interest because I have to go with my time and install itself and all these things.

294
0:19:02.120 --> 0:19:19.120
I think that's a very important aspect actually, the public representation.

295
0:19:19.120 --> 0:19:38.120
And also to make the importance of this much more known.

296
0:19:38.120 --> 0:19:41.120
Yeah, sure. I mean, I get reminded daily, right?

297
0:19:41.120 --> 0:19:43.120
My wife's like, what are you working on exactly?

298
0:19:43.120 --> 0:19:47.120
And I'm like, oh, some phone stuff, you know.

299
0:19:47.120 --> 0:19:58.120
But I know like there's a lot of people, friends, family, whatever who have tried to search online for like what this Linux mobile thing or free software mobile thing is all about.

300
0:19:58.120 --> 0:20:11.120
And they tend to see like, you know, post by people and projects who are the loudest talking about what they're doing specifically, but not like what the whole thing is about.

301
0:20:11.120 --> 0:20:40.120
And yeah, so like if a business or you or somebody is interested, you kind of just get like this hodgepodge collection of information and it's hard to like figure out what exactly is going on here.

302
0:20:40.120 --> 0:21:02.120
Yeah, yeah.

303
0:21:02.120 --> 0:21:06.120
Yeah, thanks for proving my point.

304
0:21:06.120 --> 0:21:24.120
Yes.

305
0:21:24.120 --> 0:21:32.120
Yeah, I mean, depending on how.

306
0:21:32.120 --> 0:21:37.120
No, no, no.

307
0:21:37.120 --> 0:21:47.120
Desktop Linux is what I call it. I don't know. There's yeah, you know, like Red Hat and canonical and those folks who are doing desktop and server distributions.

308
0:21:47.120 --> 0:22:01.120
Those are those communities are kind of dominated by certain companies, right, who are out there to make a product and sell support and sell services and sell products and whatever.

309
0:22:01.120 --> 0:22:09.120
We don't I mean there are some OEMs who are doing stuff that are selling products purism is the obvious one.

310
0:22:09.120 --> 0:22:16.120
But we don't really have any big like corporate participants in this community yet.

311
0:22:16.120 --> 0:22:26.120
I honestly don't want to see that happen because I think there's there's a lot of history with trying to run this type of environment on phones.

312
0:22:26.120 --> 0:22:38.120
Right. And I think that some of the past failures were due to, you know, big corporations getting involved, dumping a ton of resources in.

313
0:22:38.120 --> 0:22:49.120
You could argue whether it was like, you know, done effectively or not, but then kind of just giving up when they lose interest because, you know, it didn't turn a profit as fast as they thought it would or whatever.

314
0:22:49.120 --> 0:22:58.120
So, like, I don't want to recreate that. And I also realized, like, we don't have, you know, a ton of money pouring into this right now, which could be a good thing.

315
0:22:58.120 --> 0:23:16.120
So, I mean, this is my attempt to like try to organize without waiting around for somebody to be like, hey, that's a business model I need to throw money at and then just overwhelming us with, you know, like one option and, you know, one or two devices and and sort of just like pigeonhole in the whole community in that way.

316
0:23:16.120 --> 0:23:25.120
So I'm hoping that by bringing this discussion up now, we can kind of prevent that from happening.

317
0:23:25.120 --> 0:23:38.120
And yeah, it'd be cool if like desktop Linux had something like that. But I think we're also kind of in a more unique situation, like people that want to run Linux on their desktop.

318
0:23:38.120 --> 0:23:49.120
The hardware is kind of boring, right? Like it's mostly x86. It's kind of a solved problem. Every so often you'll get like a Wi-Fi module x up and like, oh, wow, you know, unsupported hardware.

319
0:23:49.120 --> 0:24:02.120
But on phones, it's like, oh, wow, the whole platform doesn't work. Right. And then you kind of like start from the ground up and it's getting better as as like Luca was talking about and the work that people are doing on mainland Linux.

320
0:24:02.120 --> 0:24:19.120
It's getting better with device bring up, but there's still a lot of like weird hardware out there. And so yeah, I think like a lot of the organization can benefit some of that because again, a lot of these distros are targeting some of the same hardware.

321
0:24:19.120 --> 0:24:38.120
Like when you run into a problem, it's almost certainly going to be specific to like some some device model or some family of so season. So like as distros, we want to know what those problems are. So we're not having to try to solve them individually.

322
0:24:38.120 --> 0:24:42.120
Hope that answered your question. Yeah.

323
0:24:42.120 --> 0:24:55.120
I think there's two things proposed. And I think on one side, it's how to get ordinary users engaged.

324
0:24:55.120 --> 0:25:16.120
Or like, I don't know, knowing any issues with the game. And the other side is how distros do we work together to more effectively progress, right? Or am I missing a part or? No, I think those are two things I'd like to see happen.

325
0:25:16.120 --> 0:25:38.120
I think they're very much related, right? What I mean by that is, if the distros can get their shit together, then the end user experience gets better, right? I think, in my opinion, people who develop applications for distros and don't necessarily have to think too hard about the distros or can at least like, you know, get the feedback necessary to make something that works everywhere.

326
0:25:38.120 --> 0:25:47.120
Gives end users more choices. They can run more distributions based on, and they may not care, right, in some cases.

327
0:25:47.120 --> 0:26:02.120
But also, like, it kind of sucks using a phone and running into a problem that's like distro specific, right? And you kind of want your applications to work the same, regardless of what distro you have, right?

328
0:26:02.120 --> 0:26:14.120
Because you don't want to have a phone that's running post-market OS that supports, like, you know, these applications and these features and whatnot, and then have a device running Monjaro or Mobian or something else.

329
0:26:14.120 --> 0:26:25.120
And, you know, you have a different set of things that work there, and then you have, you know, another phone with some other distro on there with, you know, some different set of applications and stuff that work there.

330
0:26:25.120 --> 0:26:35.120
So I think by getting all the distros kind of, you know, organized and I don't think it's just distros. I think it's also OEMs too.
