1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Next up, Ryu.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:15.280
Hello, everybody.

3
0:00:15.280 --> 0:00:25.720
Can everybody hear me okay in the back?

4
0:00:25.720 --> 0:00:27.720
Then I'll speak up like this, okay?

5
0:00:27.720 --> 0:00:30.720
Perfect.

6
0:00:30.720 --> 0:00:32.720
I'm going to give a talk about Ryu's.

7
0:00:32.720 --> 0:00:33.720
I'm Linus.

8
0:00:33.720 --> 0:00:36.720
I work for the Free Software Foundation Europe as a sysadmin,

9
0:00:36.720 --> 0:00:42.720
and I'm also one of the maintainers of the Ryu's tool.

10
0:00:42.720 --> 0:00:48.720
Since this is the S-bomb devroom,

11
0:00:48.720 --> 0:00:52.720
I need to relate what we do with Ryu's to S-bomb somehow.

12
0:00:52.720 --> 0:00:56.720
I think the catchphrase, or what I want you to take away from this presentation today,

13
0:00:56.720 --> 0:01:01.720
is that if you want to have nice S-bomb downstream,

14
0:01:01.720 --> 0:01:04.720
you should push everybody to use Ryu's upstream,

15
0:01:04.720 --> 0:01:07.720
because it makes everything else much, much easier,

16
0:01:07.720 --> 0:01:11.720
or just how Ryu's makes everybody's life a bit easier.

17
0:01:11.720 --> 0:01:15.720
So typically with free and open source software,

18
0:01:15.720 --> 0:01:20.720
you have compliance issues when it comes to license and copyright.

19
0:01:20.720 --> 0:01:25.720
There's missing information about license and copyright holders

20
0:01:25.720 --> 0:01:29.720
of your own code and of third-party code that you might use in your application.

21
0:01:29.720 --> 0:01:32.720
There's license ambiguity.

22
0:01:32.720 --> 0:01:35.720
So for example, if there's just, it says GPL,

23
0:01:35.720 --> 0:01:37.720
but you don't know which version.

24
0:01:37.720 --> 0:01:42.720
Often, when there's somebody taking the time to put all the information there,

25
0:01:42.720 --> 0:01:47.720
it's stored in a silo, and it's not actually where the code is.

26
0:01:47.720 --> 0:01:53.720
Often, another thing is that when you change something in the code,

27
0:01:53.720 --> 0:01:55.720
or you have a new contributor coming on,

28
0:01:55.720 --> 0:01:58.720
then you need to change everything again.

29
0:01:58.720 --> 0:02:02.720
Developers also need a lot of training if there's custom solutions,

30
0:02:02.720 --> 0:02:06.720
and there might also be conflicting compliance practices.

31
0:02:06.720 --> 0:02:14.720
So we thought, why can't we solve these issues here, up the stream,

32
0:02:14.720 --> 0:02:17.720
so that when the water flows down to everybody else

33
0:02:17.720 --> 0:02:21.720
who's consuming license and copyright information of source code

34
0:02:21.720 --> 0:02:26.720
has just an easier time digesting them.

35
0:02:26.720 --> 0:02:30.720
So reuse is based on a couple of principles.

36
0:02:30.720 --> 0:02:34.720
It should be easy for copyright and licensing information.

37
0:02:34.720 --> 0:02:37.720
Everybody should be able to find this easily,

38
0:02:37.720 --> 0:02:41.720
so it should be in the file that it applies to, if that's possible.

39
0:02:41.720 --> 0:02:43.720
Of course, with a binary file, that's not possible,

40
0:02:43.720 --> 0:02:48.720
but if it's plain text, that's possible, and then it should go in there.

41
0:02:48.720 --> 0:02:52.720
Silos should be avoided, and all the licensing copyright information

42
0:02:52.720 --> 0:02:54.720
should be stored in the repo.

43
0:02:54.720 --> 0:02:59.720
And that info should be readable by humans and machines alike.

44
0:02:59.720 --> 0:03:02.720
We also do not want to reinvent the wheel if we don't have to,

45
0:03:02.720 --> 0:03:08.720
so we try to be as compatible as possible.

46
0:03:08.720 --> 0:03:14.720
And also, licensing should be easy and fun.

47
0:03:14.720 --> 0:03:22.720
And yeah, so we try to do that.

48
0:03:22.720 --> 0:03:26.720
You can decide whether we manage, but at least we try.

49
0:03:26.720 --> 0:03:29.720
So there are three simple steps to using reuse.

50
0:03:29.720 --> 0:03:32.720
First, you choose and provide the license.

51
0:03:32.720 --> 0:03:35.720
Reuse does it with a nice little dialogue for you

52
0:03:35.720 --> 0:03:37.720
when you start it up the first time.

53
0:03:37.720 --> 0:03:39.720
I can show you later.

54
0:03:39.720 --> 0:03:42.720
Then you add copyright and licensing information,

55
0:03:42.720 --> 0:03:44.720
preferably to every file.

56
0:03:44.720 --> 0:03:49.720
And then we have a range of tooling that allows you to confirm

57
0:03:49.720 --> 0:03:52.720
this reuse compliance, either in a pre-commit hook, in CI,

58
0:03:52.720 --> 0:03:56.720
and of course locally on your machine.

59
0:03:56.720 --> 0:04:01.720
So I'll go through this quick, maybe just a quick show of hands.

60
0:04:01.720 --> 0:04:03.720
Who has heard of reuse before?

61
0:04:03.720 --> 0:04:05.720
Okay, so I'm preaching to the choir.

62
0:04:05.720 --> 0:04:08.720
Who has used it before?

63
0:04:08.720 --> 0:04:17.720
Okay, so I'll go through this rather quickly.

64
0:04:17.720 --> 0:04:22.720
One thing that we do is we save license text in a licenses directory.

65
0:04:22.720 --> 0:04:26.720
I'll make a quick shout-out to GitHub later about this.

66
0:04:26.720 --> 0:04:31.720
Then reuse names them after the SPDX license identifier,

67
0:04:31.720 --> 0:04:35.720
and then they're stored in the licenses repository.

68
0:04:35.720 --> 0:04:40.720
Then the copyright and license information is added to every file.

69
0:04:40.720 --> 0:04:45.720
Then it looks roughly like that.

70
0:04:45.720 --> 0:04:48.720
And then if you have uncommentable files,

71
0:04:48.720 --> 0:04:54.720
like binary files, images, or executables or whatever,

72
0:04:54.720 --> 0:04:58.720
then you can do a separate license file, which is a plain text file,

73
0:04:58.720 --> 0:05:01.720
which refers back to that uncommentable file,

74
0:05:01.720 --> 0:05:04.720
which then contains this information.

75
0:05:04.720 --> 0:05:10.720
And there's also you can use a depth5 file in.reuse directory.

76
0:05:10.720 --> 0:05:13.720
This is about to change soon, hopefully,

77
0:05:13.720 --> 0:05:16.720
because we are going to develop our own reuse.yaml,

78
0:05:16.720 --> 0:05:19.720
which sits at the root of the repository,

79
0:05:19.720 --> 0:05:24.720
where you can define this type of information for uncommentable files

80
0:05:24.720 --> 0:05:29.720
or for whole directories much easier than with depth5.

81
0:05:29.720 --> 0:05:33.720
And then the third step is you confirm that you're actually compliant

82
0:05:33.720 --> 0:05:35.720
with reuse.

83
0:05:35.720 --> 0:05:39.720
One of the components of reuse,

84
0:05:39.720 --> 0:05:42.720
so one thing is a spec,

85
0:05:42.720 --> 0:05:47.720
where we pretty clearly try to state how licensing information

86
0:05:47.720 --> 0:05:51.720
and copyright information should be added to source code.

87
0:05:51.720 --> 0:05:57.720
Then there's a helper tool, the reuse tool, the reuse CLI tool.

88
0:05:57.720 --> 0:06:00.720
Then there's a very good tutorial in FAQ

89
0:06:00.720 --> 0:06:04.720
that you can look into to answer very basic questions about licensing,

90
0:06:04.720 --> 0:06:07.720
but also some advanced stuff.

91
0:06:07.720 --> 0:06:10.720
And then there's an API where you can sign up your project

92
0:06:10.720 --> 0:06:12.720
and then get a nice badge.

93
0:06:12.720 --> 0:06:15.720
Who doesn't like badges?

94
0:06:15.720 --> 0:06:20.720
So I've already said that we store the licenses in the licenses directory,

95
0:06:20.720 --> 0:06:24.720
so the UI of GitHub, for example, still doesn't pick that up properly.

96
0:06:24.720 --> 0:06:28.720
That would be very cool if that happens. It's not very hard.

97
0:06:28.720 --> 0:06:35.720
And the rest of that, in the interest of time, I'll skip over that.

98
0:06:35.720 --> 0:06:40.720
So now I'll just show you really, really quick,

99
0:06:40.720 --> 0:06:44.720
because I have five minutes left, I think,

100
0:06:44.720 --> 0:06:50.720
how this works and how this works in practice.

101
0:06:50.720 --> 0:06:54.720
So here is the text size okay for everybody in the back.

102
0:06:54.720 --> 0:06:58.720
So here I'm in a non-compliant repo,

103
0:06:58.720 --> 0:07:01.720
and I can run reuse-linn to confirm that I'm not compliant.

104
0:07:01.720 --> 0:07:02.720
I have six files in this repo,

105
0:07:02.720 --> 0:07:05.720
none of them have any copyright or licensing information.

106
0:07:05.720 --> 0:07:06.720
That's not cool.

107
0:07:06.720 --> 0:07:09.720
So I can just run reuse in it.

108
0:07:09.720 --> 0:07:12.720
And now I'm asked to provide licenses,

109
0:07:12.720 --> 0:07:20.720
so usually I use something like CCO 1.0

110
0:07:20.720 --> 0:07:26.720
for configuration files and stuff like that.

111
0:07:26.720 --> 0:07:36.720
Then we could, let's add GPL.

112
0:07:36.720 --> 0:07:46.720
And then, did you mean I, GPL?

113
0:07:46.720 --> 0:07:52.720
And just call that example. That doesn't matter.

114
0:07:52.720 --> 0:07:55.720
So now we see it downloaded the licenses

115
0:07:55.720 --> 0:07:57.720
and it created a file file for us.

116
0:07:57.720 --> 0:07:59.720
Like I said, this will change.

117
0:07:59.720 --> 0:08:05.720
And now I can start adding license information to certain files.

118
0:08:05.720 --> 0:08:10.720
So for example, now I can add the license CC0 to my gitignore file,

119
0:08:10.720 --> 0:08:11.720
for example.

120
0:08:11.720 --> 0:08:14.720
I can run reuse-linn to see what's changed.

121
0:08:14.720 --> 0:08:20.720
And I see now I have one file with correct copyright information.

122
0:08:20.720 --> 0:08:23.720
And I could now continue doing that for the rest of the files,

123
0:08:23.720 --> 0:08:28.720
but I hope this, you get the idea that it's a tool

124
0:08:28.720 --> 0:08:30.720
that really simplifies this process.

125
0:08:30.720 --> 0:08:34.720
And then you can put the reuse-linn checks in your pre-commit hooks.

126
0:08:34.720 --> 0:08:36.720
They're very terse.

127
0:08:36.720 --> 0:08:41.720
They basically look like this.

128
0:08:41.720 --> 0:08:46.720
That's all you have to do and then run pre-commit install

129
0:08:46.720 --> 0:08:50.720
and then before you commit, it does the reuse-linn check.

130
0:08:50.720 --> 0:08:56.720
So it's very, very simple. It's very straightforward.

131
0:08:56.720 --> 0:09:00.720
I had to jump through this a little bit because I don't have that much time.

132
0:09:00.720 --> 0:09:01.720
I just realized.

133
0:09:01.720 --> 0:09:04.720
So the ongoing development is of course the tool

134
0:09:04.720 --> 0:09:08.720
and it's all free and open source.

135
0:09:08.720 --> 0:09:11.720
And so you can contribute as much as you'd like.

136
0:09:11.720 --> 0:09:14.720
And we're very happy about everybody who contributes.

137
0:09:14.720 --> 0:09:16.720
And then there's an API,

138
0:09:16.720 --> 0:09:20.720
which is all fully open source and free software.

139
0:09:20.720 --> 0:09:24.720
We have a specification, which will be extended with reuse-linn.yaml

140
0:09:24.720 --> 0:09:26.720
really, really soon.

141
0:09:26.720 --> 0:09:29.720
We hope that we can do some better integration,

142
0:09:29.720 --> 0:09:32.720
especially with git forages in the future,

143
0:09:32.720 --> 0:09:36.720
that the UI shows you which licenses you have in the repository right away.

144
0:09:36.720 --> 0:09:40.720
And we want to spread and you can of course help us with that.

145
0:09:40.720 --> 0:09:42.720
So who uses reuse?

146
0:09:42.720 --> 0:09:46.720
At the moment we have over 1,400 projects signed up

147
0:09:46.720 --> 0:09:53.720
that use our API that have cumulatively more than 80,000 stars on GitHub.

148
0:09:53.720 --> 0:09:56.720
Then there's stuff that lives on other forages like KDE

149
0:09:56.720 --> 0:09:58.720
and the framework that uses reuse.

150
0:09:58.720 --> 0:10:02.720
Curl became reuse-compliant as WebLate,

151
0:10:02.720 --> 0:10:06.720
a really cool translation project that recently became reuse-compliant,

152
0:10:06.720 --> 0:10:08.720
GNU Health Project, which is an awesome project,

153
0:10:08.720 --> 0:10:11.720
the KunaVAN app in Germany,

154
0:10:11.720 --> 0:10:15.720
and the Linux kernel is trying to become reuse-compliant.

155
0:10:15.720 --> 0:10:17.720
It will take a while.

156
0:10:20.720 --> 0:10:22.720
So feel free to check this.

157
0:10:22.720 --> 0:10:25.720
I will upload the slides and then you have all the links.

158
0:10:25.720 --> 0:10:29.720
If you want to participate, sign up to the mailing list,

159
0:10:29.720 --> 0:10:32.720
ask questions, create issues,

160
0:10:32.720 --> 0:10:35.720
make one of your own projects reuse-compliant.

161
0:10:35.720 --> 0:10:37.720
It's really easy.

162
0:10:37.720 --> 0:10:40.720
Integrate reuse into your community and compliance policies.

163
0:10:40.720 --> 0:10:42.720
Help others adopt reuse.

164
0:10:42.720 --> 0:10:45.720
Here I linked the developer section of the website,

165
0:10:45.720 --> 0:10:49.720
which is really the best way to get started really, really quickly.

166
0:10:49.720 --> 0:10:52.720
And yeah, I don't know.

167
0:10:52.720 --> 0:10:54.720
Do I have time for questions?

168
0:10:54.720 --> 0:10:55.720
Two minutes.

169
0:10:55.720 --> 0:10:56.720
Two minutes.

170
0:10:56.720 --> 0:10:57.720
Maybe I can take one.

171
0:10:57.720 --> 0:11:00.720
I also, just a quick note, Carmen is here.

172
0:11:00.720 --> 0:11:04.720
She's one of the main creators of reuse.

173
0:11:04.720 --> 0:11:08.720
So we'll also be happy to answer questions afterwards.

174
0:11:08.720 --> 0:11:10.720
I'll take one now.

175
0:11:10.720 --> 0:11:13.720
What does bad license mean in the Linux?

176
0:11:13.720 --> 0:11:14.720
A bad license?

177
0:11:14.720 --> 0:11:16.720
Yes, the linter shows in the header,

178
0:11:16.720 --> 0:11:18.720
the first one is bad licenses.

179
0:11:18.720 --> 0:11:19.720
I think...

180
0:11:19.720 --> 0:11:21.720
It's not an SPDX license.

181
0:11:21.720 --> 0:11:24.720
Ah, yeah, it's not an SPDX license.

182
0:11:24.720 --> 0:11:26.720
What does bad license mean?

183
0:11:26.720 --> 0:11:28.720
What does bad license mean?

184
0:11:28.720 --> 0:11:32.720
And it means that it's not an actual SPDX license.

185
0:11:32.720 --> 0:11:34.720
Yeah, but just on...

186
0:11:34.720 --> 0:11:36.720
How do you handle custom license?

187
0:11:36.720 --> 0:11:37.720
Yes.

188
0:11:37.720 --> 0:11:40.720
I don't think we handle them at all.

189
0:11:40.720 --> 0:11:45.720
You can make a custom license, license ref?

190
0:11:45.720 --> 0:11:46.720
Ah, okay.

191
0:11:46.720 --> 0:11:51.720
Yeah, so you can make a custom license ref within SPDX.

192
0:11:51.720 --> 0:11:54.720
So that SPDX allows you to do that,

193
0:11:54.720 --> 0:11:58.720
and we used to follow that.

194
0:11:58.720 --> 0:12:27.720
Yeah, sorry, only 15 minutes.
