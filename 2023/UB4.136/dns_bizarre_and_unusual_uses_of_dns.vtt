00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello everybody, welcome to our last talk of the day. This is Peter Lowe.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Am I going to be able to see them on the screen as well?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
No.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, I can look around.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Hello, this is Peter Lowe. He will be showing us many of the weird things people have done

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
with DNS to finish our day.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Thank you. First thing I should say is that this presentation normally takes about 40 minutes

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
because there's quite a lot of things to see, so I'm going to be running through it.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
It's going to be a whirlwind tour of bizarre and unusual things that people have done with DNS.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Okay, so I'm going to skip through some of this stuff. This is all about who I am.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Normally I talk about myself a little bit, but nobody's really interested in that.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
You've come to see the weird stuff, right?

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm a security researcher. I do DNS stuff basically.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Bunch of different titles for this. Not very clickbaity.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
This is an intro to DNS. I'm assuming that everybody knows what that is here, so we'll skip over that.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
This is how it all started, which is part of the DNS Abuse Special Interest Group for FIRST.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm the co-chair. John Todd from Quad9 joked about some malware distribution via DNS.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
We thought, that's not possible. Wait, hang on.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
So we started going and collecting some other stuff.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Yes, a lot of these aren't around anymore, unfortunately. It's kind of like a museum of weird DNS things.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Some of them still work, but there's a bunch of links at the end.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
If you're interested in any of these, I've tried to put resources and links to everything that you'll see.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
So, first section, trace routes. Not 100% DNS, but basically it works by setting up a static route

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
and then making sure that the reverse DNS maps back to something interesting.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
So, this was one of the first things I ever saw, the Star Wars intro via DNS.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
It was by a guy called Ryan... I'm going to be looking up here as well, by the way, because I can't remember all the details of these.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
Ryan Werber from BeedleNet in 2013. It was one of the things I saw and thought, oh, how does that work?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
And it kind of got me interested in some of the stranger parts of DNS.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
There's an IPv6 version out there somewhere. It went down very quickly because of a DDoS.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
It's typical for a lot of these things, unfortunately.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
There is this one, which is hand.bb0.nl.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
This, as you can see, displays a hand and it's done over IPv6.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
If you increase the number of hops, it does get more interesting as it goes on.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
This is the only space I had for on the slide, so...

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Sebastian Haas, who will be featured multiple times in this presentation, I hope he's here, but if not, hi, Sebastian.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
He put up a thing where you could trace and find the live scores from the Euro 2020 match, which was pretty impressive.

02:57.000 --> 03:07.000
He also wrote a thing called Fake Root or Faker Tea, which allows you to set up IPv6 roots on your local machine.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
This is another one from Makerforce. This is some alternate lyrics to American Pie, which I'm sure you're all familiar with.

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
Bad Horse. If anybody here is a fan of Dr Horrible's sing-along, there is a semi-famous thing in it called Bad Horse, where he sings a little song.

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
We have the lyrics here. If you go and have a look at the SSL certificate chain for Bad.Horse, yeah, signed up, Bad.Horse, there's a little Easter egg there as well.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
This is a screenshot of Dr Horrible.

03:39.000 --> 03:48.000
And the first time I did this, Andrew Campling, who's an encrypted DNS guy and other stuff, he said, let's put something festive in, so I went out and had a look.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
And of course, someone's done a Christmas dream, so there's another one.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Tools and toys.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
One of the first things I found was at post-elder-org, which I think is a great place to be hosting something interesting.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
It's a calculator. It's not as good as Stefan Bortzmeyer's, where you can actually put the plus character in, and it's not around anymore.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I put this, there's a reverse Polish calculator out there.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
Apparently, this is a reverse Polish calculator, so it shows how much I know about maths.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
This is one of the more interesting ones, and there's kind of a bunch of different versions of this.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
It's a local IP echo. It tells you what your public-facing IP address is.

04:26.000 --> 04:37.000
It's actually quite useful, because in scripts, instead of just doing a curl request in myip.org or whatever, this is going to get an answer much quicker, and it's much more easily scriptable.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Yes, this one is the MyIP service from Google.

04:42.000 --> 04:51.000
As everybody knows, Google is famous for discontinuing services, but they're never going to let the DNS service go.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
There's some tools here for network admins, some IP to ASN translators, lots of different options.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.000
There's Team Cymru. There's an example here. There's some other ones out there, if you go looking for them.

05:04.000 --> 05:14.000
There is an example here. I think this is from Tony Finch. This is postcodes, which will translate them to... Oh, and Jan-Pit, men, sorry.

05:14.000 --> 05:25.000
And this will give you the geolocation for postcodes in the UK. I think Jan-Pit did some... Oh, yeah, this is also the airport codes, I think.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm also missing my talk... speaker notes, by the way, so forgive me for this.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And DNS.toys, this is a great site. They put up a bunch of different things that you can look at.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
There's World Time, IP Echo, another one. Number to Words. I genuinely don't know what this is useful for.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't know why anybody would use it, but it's kind of fun to have it out there.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.000
This is one of my favorite ones. I'm quite a fan of geocaching. I don't know if you guys know about it, but it's like PokÃ©mon Go for geeks.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
And you get to go out in the world and find things that are out there. There is one geocache which has the author of Mokopetris,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
but it's unfortunately not Dr. Paul Mokopetris. This is, again, Sebastian Haas, I think.

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
And it's basically a hostname, and if you look up the text record for it, it gives you the hint for the first part of the geocache, which is... I love it, personally.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
There's a text adventure out there. This is very cool. I mean, this is what you want from DNS, right?

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
A guy called Craig Mayhew, you look up different hostnames and it gives you different options,

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
and he uses round-robin DNS for random decision trees, so it's pretty cool.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Tunnelling. Okay, so people's definition of tunnelling varies, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
It can be a simple kind of like C2 communication, or it could be full file extraction over DNS.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
I've got some examples here. If you want to discuss what tunnelling means exactly, let's meet afterwards and fight.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
This is an intro to tunnelling which I found from Slashdot in 2000, but the general concept is the same.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Wikipedia over DNS by a guy called David Ledbetter. This is very cool. It actually supports Unicode as well.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I don't think it works anymore, unfortunately, but it is basically...

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
He took a local copy of the XML dump and then installed it, I think, on PowerDNS, and you could look up pages via that.

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
Blogging, another very cool example where you look up... you publish text records and that is your static blog.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
I love it because it's going to be fast. It actually works from a blog. All you really want is the content.

07:36.000 --> 07:45.000
You can get the index, you can get specific posts, or order them by recently posted.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
Now we're getting a little bit more into the words. This is IP over DNS. There is a library out there called Iodine,

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
which is the chemical element number 53, which is appropriate. It does full IP over DNS.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
There are some examples of how this can be used later on.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm getting to the point where I lose words about how to describe this kind of stuff.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
It's all brilliant, but this is like... yeah, I don't know.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
HTTP over DNS, so we're getting even more crazy here.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
This is browser tunnel. It's actually quite useful for some things if you're in certain situations like an airport or something like that,

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
where things might be a bit restricted. This is basically how it works.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
It does raise the interesting concept of, if you're familiar with DNS over HTTPS,

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
HTTP over DNS over HTTPS.

08:45.000 --> 08:55.000
This is pretty cool. It's called Slow DNS, and it's a full VPN over DNS, which is in the Google Play Store.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
I haven't used it because it does include ads, and I've never actually got the courage to check it out properly.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
But I think it's the kind of thing that can really work in airports and other restricted areas.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
You run it, and it's a VPN that lets you access the internet, and it works over DNS.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
A lot of places, DNS is going to be unrestricted, and this is going to help you out in those situations.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
The ads thing... well, you know, give it a go, but the concept is amazing.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Another library that I found really cool is called DNS Cat 2.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
You install a server, and you install a client, and then they communicate to each other over DNS packets.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
You don't have to have an actual domain working at all. You don't have to register a domain.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
It just uses the DNS protocol, and it's got a bunch of built-in functions like sending files and Windows and messages and stuff like that.

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
It's very cool. This is still on GitHub. There's a link at the end you'll see.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And a few other things. I don't know how much time I... oh, am I out of time?

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Okay. The benefits of being the last person speaking.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
Cory Quinn talked about how you can use DNS as a full config management system.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
This is the BIMI brand indicators, which works over DNS. It uses TST records, which start with underscore BIMI.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
A full contact database. Somebody in the UK has created a whole protocol and used it to put the yellow pages online,

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
and they've got an SDK and all sorts of crazy stuff.

10:21.000 --> 10:26.000
There is dnskv.com, which is a full key value store. This works. This guy is quite dedicated to it.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I have to say I'm quite impressed. Some really good documentation. Go check it out.

10:30.000 --> 10:39.000
A file system over DNS. Yeah. I know, right? I mean, why not? Okay.

10:39.000 --> 10:47.000
Ben Cox was in the audience when I did this presentation once, and I have to say I totally lost my...

10:47.000 --> 10:56.000
It's amazing. There's an example of him on Twitter streaming an MP3 over DNS, and it's working. It's just a magical...

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Here you go. Here's the links at the end. Questions? There you go.

11:01.000 --> 11:19.000
Any questions for Peter? No? Thank you, Peter. Thank you all. Be here. Have a good day.
