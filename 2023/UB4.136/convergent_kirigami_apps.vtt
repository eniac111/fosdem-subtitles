00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome, College Mom.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Yeah.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
The NOE one.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.720
Yeah, we do a talk about Chegani, about, I'm calling it a collection of applications for

00:15.720 --> 00:18.120
past mobile and past Microsoft.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.560
So, who I am.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.160
I'm a KDE developer since 2018.

00:25.160 --> 00:31.360
I was a member of KDE EV Foundation since 2019.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.560
I started producing to KDE by basically working on websites and the accommodations, and then

00:36.560 --> 00:38.400
I started doing applications.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.560
I worked in multiple key applications, not to learn.

00:43.560 --> 00:50.160
For example, NeoChat, MathiasClients, Contras, the Korshiki applications, Tokolong, Masnol

00:50.160 --> 00:56.160
Client, Calendar, it's like a calendar application, but there's a bit more fun calendar, for

00:56.160 --> 01:01.080
example, Contras and some emails, and IRL, like an EPUB reader.

01:01.080 --> 01:09.920
I work at KADAB, but just a little two years ago, before I worked at Nest Cloud.

01:09.920 --> 01:10.920
So what is Chegani?

01:10.920 --> 01:13.920
Chegani is like a framework.

01:13.920 --> 01:21.080
You actually took it to basically like a real project applications.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.080
It's written in QML.

01:23.080 --> 01:28.480
QML is like a language, a delivery paper, by Qt.

01:28.480 --> 01:39.320
It's a declarative language, but it's sort of mix of Jison and Devasquip, but for a really

01:39.320 --> 01:46.080
good integration with C++, so you can always use C++ often.

01:46.080 --> 01:53.520
It was basically, QML was developed to build mobile and applications in the Nokia times,

01:53.520 --> 02:04.200
when Qt was owned by Nokia, and I'm using that for past mobile, but as well to develop

02:04.200 --> 02:11.440
conversion applications, not only for mobile, but also for desktop.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.920
Basically how it works is that you have multiple pages.

02:16.920 --> 02:22.080
Here you can see two pages.

02:22.080 --> 02:27.680
One has a list of emails, and the second page with the content of the email.

02:27.680 --> 02:34.440
There's also like a Java concept, basically you can have things on the left and right,

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
additional information.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.040
This is like a figure, oh, it looks like desktop.

02:40.040 --> 02:50.320
And on mobile, you get only one page displayed at a time, like you see of two and only one,

02:50.320 --> 02:52.200
but it's got the same UI.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.360
It's still like the same code, but what?

02:56.360 --> 03:00.680
First of all, the drivers are mobile friendly.

03:00.680 --> 03:06.120
Instead of putting them on the left, you have some sort of collapsed driver.

03:06.120 --> 03:11.560
Basically, there's two ways to have pages.

03:11.560 --> 03:19.600
Either you put them in the column, like here, especially when it's for each of us, or you

03:19.600 --> 03:24.840
can also put them as layers on top of each of us.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.560
On each page, there's some actions.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.240
You can basically add some buttons on the top, details you want.

03:34.240 --> 03:43.160
But basically, how you build the key notifications, there's a few concepts, the pages, and so

03:43.160 --> 03:47.200
it all works, and basically most of the key notifications that they look at.

03:47.200 --> 03:52.360
For example, for short notifications, like your chat, you only have two pages, one left

03:52.360 --> 04:02.560
for the list of users, or chats, and one right with a few chats.

04:02.560 --> 04:10.520
And yeah, it's basic logs.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.880
And basically, our key game we started was 2015.

04:13.880 --> 04:20.480
We are not personal buy, but at that time, we are still using the plasma components.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.120
So basically, the same components that we are using for the plasma desktop, you are

04:24.120 --> 04:26.040
using them to create applications.

04:26.040 --> 04:32.240
But these are squeezing issues because first they got a look of personal applets, and as

04:32.240 --> 04:34.240
in applications, key applications.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.800
Maybe as on the code, not convergence, so you are basically like to build applications

04:39.800 --> 04:44.000
for mobile and other applications for desktop, which are the same for AT.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.160
There's a lot of duplications of efforts.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.480
So I'll try like one year later, we can create micro-matting, and I think of key game, we

04:53.480 --> 05:00.920
created key game to basically only have to build one applications for both mobile and

05:00.920 --> 05:01.920
desktop.

05:01.920 --> 05:12.280
I mean, this is like a really long time ago, eight years ago, seven years ago.

05:12.280 --> 05:19.760
And then we tried to add more integration with the desktop because even at the beginning,

05:19.760 --> 05:24.400
the key applications were more like mobile applications still.

05:24.400 --> 05:31.600
So one of the things that we did first was like to create a team for the desktop, QQC2

05:31.600 --> 05:39.840
desktop team, basically like critical controls, the framework that we are, the QQKML allows

05:39.840 --> 05:44.360
you to have teams where basically can implement the features.

05:44.360 --> 05:52.080
We have like a desktop team, what looks like a desktop applications, normal QQC2 applications.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.760
When you're at our, we did a lot of work as a whole, and so is the colors, but they use

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
the same colors.

05:58.760 --> 06:07.880
And the desktop, as a QQKML, uses the same colors as normal QQC2 applications.

06:07.880 --> 06:18.320
And before 2020, there was like, I must know, the device that we could use key game.

06:18.320 --> 06:25.080
So the development was quite slow because I mean, there was the Nexus 5, what kind of

06:25.080 --> 06:34.120
worked with, but it was small, all device, but was slow, really slow.

06:34.120 --> 06:40.160
And then there was 2020, pine64 and pinephone.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.160
And I think that's really a way to get the contributors.

06:43.160 --> 06:50.600
And as a way of contributing to plus nearby, it was a natural pinephone.

06:50.600 --> 06:57.200
You add clearly like a device that you can call by and what supported Linux.

06:57.200 --> 07:06.440
And I get here last year, we also launched the QQM add-ons.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.920
I will go more into that later.

07:09.920 --> 07:18.440
Yeah, basically like, in recent times, we like, felt like working new components, like

07:18.440 --> 07:28.080
for the previous settings from Tokodone, the Muslim account, yeah, we've worked with a

07:28.080 --> 07:36.840
lot of chat, there's a list to have a nice look.

07:36.840 --> 07:45.600
But if you do, yeah, and again, the Tokodone settings, we actually see moving from components

07:45.600 --> 07:53.200
to basically like, mostly doing forms, but we are also using that for other stuff, basically

07:53.200 --> 07:58.720
display formations, yeah, still a bit the idea of GNOME for that because they look quite

07:58.720 --> 08:01.000
nice.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.800
And yeah, that also like, basically like some combinations of the forms, one of the last

08:07.800 --> 08:15.920
introductions we added to KGami, we are going to use these tree views, like here it's in

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
calendars.

08:16.920 --> 08:27.080
I was going to do three, I will detail information as a tree.

08:27.080 --> 08:33.640
It is useful for the test view in the calendar, where you can see the task and the task.

08:33.640 --> 08:41.160
Yeah, another one, last instruction that I created, what I contributed to is a sash pop-up,

08:41.160 --> 08:46.040
it's a nice component where you can basically like have a sash filled with a pop-up, but

08:46.040 --> 08:52.800
appears when you click on it, with the results, it's pretty nice, I think, with the nice animations,

08:52.800 --> 08:59.800
but yeah, that's mostly it.

08:59.800 --> 09:06.800
Thank you very much.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.800
Question, comments.

09:11.800 --> 09:25.800
Yeah, I was interested in how many devices are associated with support of platform on

09:25.800 --> 09:32.800
the platform, can you repeat?

09:32.800 --> 09:40.800
I mean, there's a, buying from, buying from poor, but like supporting intraday, when the

09:40.800 --> 09:45.920
pass-over team doesn't really like to the, or the advent implementations, we focus on

09:45.920 --> 09:54.280
the UI because it's where we are quite good at, but the post-market OS folks, I mean,

09:54.280 --> 09:58.760
everything that's on post-market OS, for example, can run post-market mobile, because it's

09:58.760 --> 10:03.640
basically like just a shell on top of post-market OS, or manjaro, as well as a, manjaro mobile

10:03.640 --> 10:11.240
editions and there's like a lot of over-smart descriptions, I think open source as a mobile

10:11.240 --> 10:15.400
variant and basically everything that's called mainline.

10:15.400 --> 10:22.280
The important thing is what needs to be mainline support, we, at the beginning support it as

10:22.280 --> 10:30.080
well as like not-mainline devices, but we had to stop that because there's too much

10:30.080 --> 10:34.560
work to support both this sort of device and mainline, we had a lot of issues with the

10:34.560 --> 10:47.000
telecommunications stack, because we had the, we were funo, what we were using, but it wasn't

10:47.000 --> 10:57.920
really working well for us, so we switched to a little mobile manager, yeah, with a manager,

10:57.920 --> 11:03.880
and yeah, but basically, yeah, every device that runs mainline Linux has a run, that's

11:03.880 --> 11:07.920
mobile, I mean, you can have a run in the desktop if you want it, I wouldn't recommend

11:07.920 --> 11:09.920
that, but you can do that.

11:09.920 --> 11:37.800
I mean, we have partnership with Pine, 64, so we shipped personal wire on the Pine phone,

11:37.800 --> 11:46.320
but it's quite hard to, I mean, probably no mainstream mobile manufacturer has support

11:46.320 --> 11:50.600
for mainline Linux, and they are not really interested to support that, and they're not

11:50.600 --> 11:57.760
really interested to have something else run under it, so it's a bit, because I mean, there's

11:57.760 --> 12:02.880
not enough applications, I mean, it's one of the issues, under it's ecosystem has a

12:02.880 --> 12:08.760
lot of applications, we can actually like, wait to run applications on past mobile, but

12:08.760 --> 12:21.240
see like, yes, before we can, maybe see like, it's run on, installed on our mainstream devices.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.760
I'm mostly focusing on applications, because that's the thing, it's part where we are

12:25.760 --> 12:34.760
liking the most, native applications, don't really do the pass-master stuff.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.760
Other questions?

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
Yeah.

12:38.760 --> 12:53.880
I think there is an, as a browser interface, that supports, okay, C++, you know, it wasn't

12:53.880 --> 12:55.880
implemented by UNR a few years ago.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.880
Yeah.

12:56.880 --> 13:06.760
Do you have in Kirikami any support for switching light mode and dark mode?

13:06.760 --> 13:15.120
Basically choosing the color shims API, which basically it works, if you, in your chat it's

13:15.120 --> 13:21.240
implemented, so you can basically switch the color shims, but by default it just follows

13:21.240 --> 13:24.080
what the plasma colors are.

13:24.080 --> 13:30.120
If you have the, it's basically like, we are trying to have the Kirikami applications,

13:30.120 --> 13:37.880
but are quite new and not yet completely mature to like, looks and be exactly like the older

13:37.880 --> 13:38.880
Kirikami applications.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.920
So basically like, if you change the colors, every application we change the colors, the

13:43.920 --> 13:52.160
QT widget one and QT1, but you can also like, implement, especially what one application

13:52.160 --> 13:55.920
should only be one team, one color, it's also possible.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.920
Yeah.

13:56.920 --> 14:06.920
Do you see more KV desktop applications being ported to Kirikami in the future?

14:06.920 --> 14:09.920
It's always like a bit of a controversial team.

14:09.920 --> 14:17.680
I'm in, we find them in basically like, the wording, we foreclose you, the entire, the

14:17.680 --> 14:23.520
same stack as all the KV applications, like a calendar, mail, contact, it's quite a bit

14:23.520 --> 14:24.520
of work.

14:24.520 --> 14:30.360
I think it's worth it because it's, looks a bit more, more nicer, but you see like,

14:30.360 --> 14:34.280
a lot of work to get it completely right.

14:34.280 --> 14:40.480
And I'm, what you only want is basically like, at least the Kirikami applications and the

14:40.480 --> 14:44.040
Kirikami applications, because we can't get rid of all the Kirikami applications and how

14:44.040 --> 14:50.080
about everything in Kirikami, but the integrates, what looks the same, what they work the same,

14:50.080 --> 14:54.880
so when you interact with it, it should be like consistent.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.520
I mean, that's all good because we can't just go with Kirikami.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
Thank you.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.520
No more?

15:04.520 --> 15:33.520
If not, then thank you very much.
