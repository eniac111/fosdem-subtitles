00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
All right.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Hi.

00:02.000 --> 00:10.240
My name is Joshua Watt and I'm here to talk to you today about automated S-bomb generation

00:10.240 --> 00:13.280
using a case study of the way that we generate S-bombs in Open Embedded.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.760
A little bit about me.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.480
I've been working at Garmin since 2009.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.520
We've been using Open Embedded in the ARK project to do embedded system development since

00:19.520 --> 00:21.060
2016.

00:21.060 --> 00:24.560
I'm a member of the Open Embedded Technical Steering Committee and there's all the ways

00:24.560 --> 00:26.200
you can contact me if you're interested later.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.780
I'll post my slides after my talk.

00:28.780 --> 00:32.000
So we're all hopefully familiar with what an S-bomb is.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
We use it to describe what software components we have in our system, what we know about

00:36.000 --> 00:38.840
them, what we don't know about them, and importantly, what the relationship between

00:38.840 --> 00:41.640
them is.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.000
So why are S-bombs important?

00:43.000 --> 00:47.240
If we're using software ourselves or allowing other people to use it or shipping it to customers

00:47.240 --> 00:51.000
or whatever we're doing with it, we want to know what's in our software.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.200
We want to know where it came from, what versions those things are at a very minimum.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.240
If there's software licenses, we want to know if we need to do anything to comply with them

01:00.240 --> 01:04.520
or things like that or make sure they're not being used improperly.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.100
We don't want to expose ourselves or people using our software or customers or whatever

01:08.100 --> 01:16.800
it is to risk by having software that's been tampered with either maliciously or unintentionally.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.000
And we also want to know if any vulnerabilities come up after it's shipped so that we can

01:21.000 --> 01:24.640
fix them if necessary or if it's vulnerable to exploit.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.360
And really the question that we want to know is can we trace the binary things that we

01:28.360 --> 01:34.960
have given to people back to the source code that produced it?

01:34.960 --> 01:40.640
Often we talk about S-bombs, we talk about them as being nutrition information for software.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.840
And I really do like this analogy.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.280
I think it easily encapsulates something that everyone is familiar with, which is a standardized

01:47.280 --> 01:49.920
way of encoding something.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.240
For S-bombs, we're trying to standardize the way that we encode information about software

01:54.240 --> 01:59.320
just like nutrition labels, try to standardize the way that we communicate what's in our

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
food.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.800
So most people can look at a nutrition label and have an understanding of how it works.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.360
So we want S-bombs to be the same way.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.200
You can look at the S-bomb and it's a way of encoding what we have.

02:11.200 --> 02:18.240
I think this is a great analogy, but it is missing a few key pieces.

02:18.240 --> 02:22.880
And the pieces that it's missing are really the supply chain part of the analysis.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.760
So it can tell us what's in our software, just like a nutrition label tells us what's

02:26.760 --> 02:29.320
in our food, but it doesn't tell us how it got there.

02:29.320 --> 02:34.440
A nutrition label isn't saying this grain came from here or whatever.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.440
And that's the part that we're sort of missing with S-bombs that we would like to know.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.920
And that's what this talk is about.

02:41.920 --> 02:48.040
So I don't have a nice analogy for how to communicate a supply chain that's like the

02:48.040 --> 02:52.600
nutrition label, but I do come from a consumer manufacturing background, so I do understand

02:52.600 --> 02:54.240
supply chains.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.640
So we can relate software supply chains to physical supply chains.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.400
And when you have physical supply chains, say you're making some consumer electronics,

03:01.400 --> 03:06.960
you've got all these steps along the path of getting the completed product.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.140
And you need to know where every component comes from to make sure that all the right

03:11.140 --> 03:15.560
components are in the right place at the right time to be manufactured.

03:15.560 --> 03:19.640
You need to know what's being combined in every step for the same reason.

03:19.640 --> 03:23.080
And you need to know where this combination takes place, because in modern supply chains

03:23.080 --> 03:27.520
these steps can be spread out geographically all over the world.

03:27.520 --> 03:32.520
And they can also be spread out over time, so if you produce 10,000 of one thing and

03:32.520 --> 03:36.840
then put it in storage and then you pull those out, you might need to know, like, are these

03:36.840 --> 03:37.840
10 years old?

03:37.840 --> 03:38.840
Are these five years old?

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
Like, how old are these parts?

03:39.840 --> 03:42.080
When were they manufactured?

03:42.080 --> 03:47.940
And when we talk about software supply chains, we have basically the same questions.

03:47.940 --> 03:52.000
We need to know where all the components that are in our supply chain came from.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.320
However, in this case, we're usually talking about things like source code that we've compiled

03:56.320 --> 04:01.760
and then the tools that we use to compile it instead of physical components.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.160
We need to know what has been combined at each stage.

04:04.160 --> 04:09.000
Did we take this library from this other project and put it into what we're currently working

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
on?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.720
You know, does it pull in some dependencies from somewhere?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.960
Things like that.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.320
We need to know where this combination takes place, although we're probably less concerned

04:19.320 --> 04:26.920
with the physical location as much as the build host that's doing the combination.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
And who did it?

04:27.920 --> 04:32.820
Potentially, we would like to know who did this step of our supply chain.

04:32.820 --> 04:34.500
And then, you know, when did it occur?

04:34.500 --> 04:36.200
Was the software compiled 10 years ago?

04:36.200 --> 04:43.300
It's probably got vulnerabilities that we should take a closer look at.

04:43.300 --> 04:47.500
To help answer some of these questions, SPDX has a build working group that's been working

04:47.500 --> 04:50.520
on the build profile.

04:50.520 --> 04:58.420
And it will hopefully be releasing with SPDX 3 in a couple months or whenever that is soon.

04:58.420 --> 05:02.120
And it's designed to answer the questions of when a build was done, so it can require

05:02.120 --> 05:05.040
time stamps for when builds happen.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.960
Who wanted a build done?

05:06.960 --> 05:12.400
So this is going to be the person who initiated the build or wanted the build done or did

05:12.400 --> 05:15.400
the build themselves, depending on the circumstances.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.300
And that's distinct from who actually performed the build, which might be, could be a person

05:20.300 --> 05:24.640
if they're manually, you know, typing in the command to do the build, or it could be a

05:24.640 --> 05:26.960
service like GitHub Actions or something like that.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.160
And that's why we have the two different who steps in there, or two different who elements

05:31.160 --> 05:34.560
in there to distinguish between the person who clicked the button and GitHub Actions

05:34.560 --> 05:39.340
and GitHub Actions that actually did the build, or whatever your service is.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.640
So how the build was done.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.360
This is going to be tool specific information about how the build was performed, like the

05:44.360 --> 05:48.600
command line arguments, things like that.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.520
It's important to note that the build and run time dependencies are already actually

05:52.520 --> 05:59.120
captured by the SPDX core specification, so we don't include those explicitly here, but

05:59.120 --> 06:02.480
they're already included.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.480
Where the build was done.

06:03.480 --> 06:08.160
So this is going to be the build host, the computer on which the build was performed.

06:08.160 --> 06:13.040
So this might be as complicated as an entire and other software bill of materials.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.800
If you have one that describes the system you're building on, you could link into that

06:16.800 --> 06:20.320
and know all the information about the build host also.

06:20.320 --> 06:25.320
But also it would capture the tool used, like if you have compilers or host tools or things

06:25.320 --> 06:29.480
like that.

06:29.480 --> 06:34.560
And then the what you're building is already covered by the SPDX core profile, because

06:34.560 --> 06:40.160
it can describe packages and files and things like that.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.600
So one of the key points is that it's really important to try to generate build S-bombs

06:44.600 --> 06:47.220
at actual build time.

06:47.220 --> 06:53.080
And to try to explain that a little further, I'm going to kind of compare generating S-bombs

06:53.080 --> 06:57.080
at build time versus two other ways that S-bombs are commonly generated, although these aren't

06:57.080 --> 06:59.000
the only other ways they're generated.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.440
So there's source S-bombs, which are generally, this is like reuse or something that's just

07:02.440 --> 07:05.280
included with the source code, which is really cool.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.800
And then you've got postmortem S-bomb analysis.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.160
So this would be the tools that run after you have the final artifact to try to scan

07:11.160 --> 07:14.400
it and say you're vulnerable to these vulnerabilities and things like that.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.480
Try to determine information after, from the final artifact.

07:18.480 --> 07:24.920
And obviously I'm trying to say that we should generate build S-bomb information at build

07:24.920 --> 07:25.920
time.

07:25.920 --> 07:29.360
So I'm not trying to say that the other two things are just terrible and never use them.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.160
They all have their strengths and weaknesses.

07:31.160 --> 07:36.280
I'm just trying to explain why I think we should build them at build time.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.160
So we talk about when something can be built.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.160
Source S-bombs obviously can't know this because they're not worried about when something is

07:42.160 --> 07:44.160
actually built.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.560
Build S-bombs should be able to figure this out from when the thing is built.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.480
You can record time stamps pretty easily.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.560
And postmortem analysis, my A may not be able to figure this out.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.480
It just depends on if that information happens to be encoded in whatever you've produced.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.560
We talk about how, so build time dependencies.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.840
Source S-bombs might be able to capture this if you're talking about something like a cargo

08:04.840 --> 08:09.880
or NPM that explicitly encodes specific versions of dependencies in the source code.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.800
You could very easily figure out and know what the build time dependencies are.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.480
Otherwise if you're talking about shared libraries or something, it might be able to know those

08:17.480 --> 08:18.980
but it wouldn't know them concretely.

08:18.980 --> 08:23.400
So you'd know like I need open SSL but you wouldn't necessarily know the specific version

08:23.400 --> 08:26.600
of open SSL that it built against.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.360
Build time, you should know all of this.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.640
You should be able to know all of this at build time.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.680
You basically have to in order to correctly build the software.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.840
So you kind of need to know that.

08:37.840 --> 08:44.120
For postmortem analysis, you might be able to figure it out probably with some sort of

08:44.120 --> 08:47.480
heuristically and static libraries are always very problematic with this.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.160
It can be very difficult to tell if a given executable has a static library in it or not

08:51.160 --> 08:55.320
because it's not recorded anywhere in the executable.

08:55.320 --> 09:00.080
So those can always be very tricky to trace back to their origin.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.860
runtime dependencies are a somewhat similar story.

09:02.860 --> 09:09.160
So source S-bombs, you could know what they are but probably not concretely again.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.280
Build S-bombs, you could know this if you're doing complete packaging.

09:13.280 --> 09:20.560
So if you're generating final packages like Debian packages or Fedora packages or OPK packages

09:20.560 --> 09:33.120
or whatever, you could know this, know what these runtime dependencies are even concretely.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.240
And for postmortem analysis, for shared libraries, you can actually figure this out pretty easily

09:36.240 --> 09:38.040
because it's in the ELF header.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.740
But for anything that's like runtime dynamically loaded, like if you do DL open or something

09:42.740 --> 09:46.760
like that, you probably can't figure that out very easily with postmortem analysis.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.520
In your build environment, I believe source S-bombs don't care about this.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.760
Build S-bombs, you should be able to know this information.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.480
And for postmortem analysis, maybe you could figure that out.

09:57.480 --> 10:04.160
I don't know if it was encoded in the executables, maybe some of that information could be known.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.640
There's a couple of advantages for generating supply chains from your build tools at build

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
time.

10:09.640 --> 10:14.240
I'd like to say that they're authoritative because they have firsthand knowledge because

10:14.240 --> 10:16.640
they're the ones actually doing the build.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.240
So they should know what's actually happening at each step.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.760
And likewise, they're very accurate.

10:22.760 --> 10:29.240
There shouldn't need to be a lot of guessing from your build tools about what's going on

10:29.240 --> 10:33.480
at each step, unlike the postmortem analysis, which tends to, I think, use a lot of heuristics

10:33.480 --> 10:36.320
or things like that.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.780
And they're comprehensive.

10:37.780 --> 10:42.040
They can analyze a lot of different steps in your build, especially if your build, your

10:42.040 --> 10:46.720
software supply chain is very deep, which I think it is for a lot of things.

10:46.720 --> 10:53.800
And so they can generate a lot of information about your builds, as we'll see later.

10:53.800 --> 10:58.040
And they're also able to analyze things that are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze

10:58.040 --> 11:05.160
at other steps, like particularly static libraries can be very difficult to trace back, at least

11:05.160 --> 11:07.720
as far as I know.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.920
So what kind of things could generate this information?

11:09.920 --> 11:14.120
So starting from the top down, at the highest level, you'd have things like container build

11:14.120 --> 11:15.320
systems.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.260
So this would be Docker build or builder or something like that.

11:19.260 --> 11:23.000
As you move down, you get into what I call the meta or distro build systems.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.560
This would be open embedded, which is what I'm going to give an example of in just a

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
few minutes.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.600
Debian, Fedora could generate this every time they generate packages.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.280
That would be a good time to do that.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.680
And then if you go down even a further step, you've got the package build systems.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.160
It's not a great name for them.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.160
But this would be things like mason or CMake or auto tools.

11:43.160 --> 11:48.280
They could all generate this information also with what they know about builds.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.440
And you could go down an even further step and say, well, maybe GCC should spit out this

11:51.440 --> 11:54.400
information and maybe it should.

11:54.400 --> 12:00.440
That's also something that could happen and then it could sort of flow up the build stack

12:00.440 --> 12:01.440
as you go.

12:01.440 --> 12:06.240
So I'm going to give an example of what we do in open embedded.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.120
I have to generate S bombs.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.080
If you are unfamiliar with open embedded and the Octo project, open embedded is a community

12:14.080 --> 12:18.000
driven project that provides the open embedded core layer and the build system, which is

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
called BitBake.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.480
The Octo project is a Linux foundation project that provides the Pocky reference distribution

12:27.480 --> 12:31.620
and runs a whole bunch of QA tests to make sure everything stays high quality, manages

12:31.620 --> 12:33.040
some release schedules.

12:33.040 --> 12:38.160
They provide funding for personnel to work on the project full time and servers and things

12:38.160 --> 12:39.160
like that.

12:39.160 --> 12:40.720
And they provide very good, excellent documentation.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.200
You should go check out our documentation.

12:44.200 --> 12:50.600
The purpose of these projects is to build primarily but not exclusively embedded systems.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.160
So we do have our traditional image.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.220
You could flash in a Raspberry Pi up there colloquially.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.400
We call these target images.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.280
But we can produce images for a whole bunch of different things that I'm not going to

13:03.280 --> 13:04.600
go into in great detail here.

13:04.600 --> 13:10.000
I've got a bunch of other presentations on this that I have links to later.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.440
So when people want to build stuff with open embedded, what they start with is they have

13:15.440 --> 13:21.240
some source code and they have some metadata and they have some policy information and

13:21.240 --> 13:26.160
they chuck all of this into this magical tool called BitBake and it spits out this target

13:26.160 --> 13:31.760
image that we talked about and then you flash that on your widget and profit.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.960
It's great.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.360
A little deeper under the hood, the way that this works is that we start off with some

13:39.360 --> 13:40.440
host tools.

13:40.440 --> 13:44.240
So this is like the minimal set of things that you need to build with BitBake.

13:44.240 --> 13:52.240
So it's going to be like your host GCC, Python, and a couple other fairly standard dependencies

13:52.240 --> 13:55.200
that run on your host.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.280
And we're going to take those host tools and parse some recipe metadata that says how to

13:59.280 --> 14:01.600
build some source code.

14:01.600 --> 14:06.360
And that source code is going to be used to build what we call the native tools and the

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
cross compilers.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.960
So the native tools are still tools that are designed to run on your host system.

14:11.960 --> 14:13.880
And then we also build the cross compiler at the same time.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.120
So something like an example of this might be like the protobuf compiler.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.720
We actually build that ourselves and don't require you to provide your own.

14:21.720 --> 14:22.720
We also build our own cross compilers.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.640
You don't have any new cross compiler on your host system.

14:28.640 --> 14:34.000
We then use those native tools and cross compiler to process more recipe metadata that's going

14:34.000 --> 14:36.920
to take some more source code in.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.400
And this is actually going to cross compile and build what we call your target packages

14:40.400 --> 14:47.200
that are designed to run on your final system, be it x86 or ARM or MIPS or PowerPC or RISC-V

14:47.200 --> 14:49.520
or whatever it is.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.880
And then we process yet some more metadata.

14:51.880 --> 14:56.160
And this one says how to combine all these target packages to make your root file system

14:56.160 --> 14:59.400
and your kernel and all of these other things that you need to actually have your target

14:59.400 --> 15:03.740
image.

15:03.740 --> 15:08.720
The way that bitbait keeps all of this sane and tracks the dependencies is it uses a sophisticated

15:08.720 --> 15:17.360
method of hashing where each step along the way called a task has a hash that is the encapsulation

15:17.360 --> 15:24.720
of all of the dependencies of that task, all of the variables that affect that task's execution

15:24.720 --> 15:27.920
and all of the code that it's actually executing.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.300
And then that gets combined into a single hash.

15:30.300 --> 15:35.200
And then that hash then is the input as a dependency to every task that depends on that

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
one.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.680
So you get this chain of hashes all the way down following from your recipes that you

15:41.680 --> 15:43.720
start with to your target image.

15:43.720 --> 15:49.320
So what happens is if, for example, something about the protobuf recipe changes, that's

15:49.320 --> 15:52.040
going to change the task hash for that recipe.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.500
That's going to cause that protobuf tool to be rebuilt.

15:55.500 --> 15:59.320
And that's also going to change all of the downstream hashes that depend on that all

15:59.320 --> 16:02.640
the way through any native tool that depends on that, any target packages that depend on

16:02.640 --> 16:06.840
that and all the way through the root file system that indirectly depends on that.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.760
And so all of those things will be rebuilt by bitbait when you change that particular

16:10.760 --> 16:11.760
thing.

16:11.760 --> 16:19.800
And so just because of this hashing mechanism, OpenEmbedded and bitbait start out with a

16:19.800 --> 16:23.800
very strong software supply chain because we have these very strict rules about how

16:23.800 --> 16:26.560
these hashes change and this causes everything to be rebuilt.

16:26.560 --> 16:33.840
And so you can actually trace it back from your target image to the target source code

16:33.840 --> 16:35.800
that produced all your target packages.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.720
And you can even trace that back to your cross compiler and your native tools that we built.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.080
And there are ways in other presentations I've done that you can see.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.280
You can even trace the Spectre host tools if you really want to do that and have that

16:46.280 --> 16:49.600
really deep supply chain.

16:49.600 --> 16:54.760
So basically what we do in OpenEmbedded is at each step along the way here when we're

16:54.760 --> 17:00.360
building something, while we're building it, we also spit out this SPDX document that says

17:00.360 --> 17:03.060
this is what we did here at this step.

17:03.060 --> 17:07.200
And then at the very end, we take all of the SPDX documents that went into our target image

17:07.200 --> 17:12.720
and or native tools that were used to build a target image and we put them all into one

17:12.720 --> 17:17.080
big archive.

17:17.080 --> 17:24.280
And we have a rich set of dependencies that we actually report when we do this.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.360
I'm not going to get into too much detail here.

17:26.360 --> 17:31.240
Again, there's other talks I've given that you can see that describe all of this in more

17:31.240 --> 17:33.680
detail if you're interested.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.340
And these are those talks.

17:35.340 --> 17:39.000
If you want to see those.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.960
And these talk very a lot more specifically about OpenEmbedded and S-Bombs.

17:44.960 --> 17:52.440
So when you do this, we can currently generate SPDX 2.2 JSON format.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.520
And I did this for a minimal QMU AR-64 system.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.700
So the root file system was 14 megabytes uncompressed.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.260
The Linux kernel was 20 megabytes.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.680
And we had 158 megabytes of SPDX document.

18:04.680 --> 18:09.080
So yeah, it's a lot.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.800
I was actually going to post up the archive.

18:12.800 --> 18:17.080
But yeah, so it's a lot of data.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.160
And we're not even reporting on everything yet.

18:19.160 --> 18:24.200
Like, you know, it's well, I mean, some of that is the JSON encoding and things like

18:24.200 --> 18:25.200
that.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
But it's just a ton of data.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.480
So the question is, do we really need all of this?

18:27.480 --> 18:31.160
Like, there's a lot of stuff to lug around.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.840
And I think you can harken it back to that nutrition information.

18:34.840 --> 18:41.080
Like as a consumer of a given food product, you know, wheat is wheat, right?

18:41.080 --> 18:45.280
Like I don't necessarily care how the wheat got into my crackers or whatever it is that

18:45.280 --> 18:48.400
I'm eating.

18:48.400 --> 18:54.540
But if I'm a manufacturer of that food and I need to track something down that went wrong

18:54.540 --> 18:57.880
somewhere to do a recall or something, then I really care where that came from.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.680
And so I think the same analogy could probably be made.

19:01.680 --> 19:07.160
It's possible your end consumers don't really care about your supply chain.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.800
But if you're manufacturing something or building something, you probably definitely do so you

19:10.800 --> 19:13.600
can trace down problems and things like that.

19:13.600 --> 19:19.320
And you know, there's always the possibility that there could be regulatory requirements

19:19.320 --> 19:21.320
for this in the future.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.920
You know, that seems to be a thing that's happening now.

19:24.920 --> 19:30.240
So yeah, so if you're trying to track down a supply chain attack or, you know, something's

19:30.240 --> 19:34.680
gone wrong somewhere, then you probably will definitely want this information.

19:34.680 --> 19:41.000
So if you work on a tool that does something that looks like building, please consider

19:41.000 --> 19:47.480
adding build profile support to your tool.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.160
Because it's actually really not that hard.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.040
Like for OpenEmbedded, we already had all of this information.

19:52.040 --> 19:58.920
It was just a matter of encoding it, as hopefully it was somewhat clear from what we were doing

19:58.920 --> 19:59.920
here.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.920
Like we already had all this information.

20:00.920 --> 20:05.120
It was just a matter of writing out the document that had it and then combining it at the end.

20:05.120 --> 20:09.880
And with SPDX3, the combination at the end is going to be a lot better than it was with

20:09.880 --> 20:10.880
2.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.160
So and that's all I had.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.160
Are there any questions?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
Yes, you have many megabytes of SPDX.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.160
Yes.

20:16.160 --> 20:25.400
So I suppose you don't have a big file, but you have multiple files related with SPDX

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
relationships?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
Yeah, it uses.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
Can you repeat the question for me?

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
Oh, sorry.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.880
Yeah, so we have a whole bunch of documents.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.000
So we're not generating one big SPDX document.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.840
We've got a whole bunch of small documents.

20:36.840 --> 20:37.960
Yes.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.520
So yes, we do that.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.560
We use a whole bunch of external document references.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.800
And then they're in SPDX2, and this will be better in SPDX3, but in SPDX2 there isn't

20:48.800 --> 20:52.200
a standardized way to combine documents together.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.920
So we just throw them all into one big tarball.

20:55.920 --> 21:00.480
It's not the greatest, but it does put them all in one file for consumption.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.200
They do exist, at the point of build, they do exist on the file system as individual

21:04.200 --> 21:07.600
documents that you could package up however you want.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.740
It's just for ease of our end users.

21:11.740 --> 21:14.880
It's easiest if we just put them all in one big tarball, and they can extract it and do

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
whatever they want with it.

21:15.880 --> 21:21.360
But yeah, a whole bunch of external document references in our output.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.360
Yes.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.360
Two questions.

21:23.360 --> 21:29.600
One slide, if you are not there on the QF presentation, will you be able to do that later?

21:29.600 --> 21:30.920
Yeah, I will post the slides.

21:30.920 --> 21:31.920
Yes, I will do that.

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
I was, yeah.

21:32.920 --> 21:41.600
As part of an official release, you give this tarball to the release of your project?

21:41.600 --> 21:47.880
Yeah, so there's an option you can turn on in your build that will, I don't remember

21:47.880 --> 21:48.960
if we turn it on by default.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.160
It's very easy to turn on.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.280
So you turn it on, and then you just get this tarball as part of your build.

21:53.280 --> 22:00.280
So what happens in OpenEmbedded is you generate a file system like my file system, and that's

22:00.280 --> 22:01.400
your root file system.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.280
And then alongside that, there will be my file system.spdx.tar.jeezy or whatever it

22:06.280 --> 22:07.280
is.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.280
I forgot off the top of my head.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
But yeah, it's that simple.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.640
I think I'm not the answer, given the size of it.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.960
So you don't deliver the SPDX as part of the image?

22:15.960 --> 22:17.120
No, yeah.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.760
We do not deliver the SPDX as part of the image.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.800
So is SPDX not providing some integrity that you could say?

22:24.800 --> 22:29.640
So an end consumer just says, I've got this SPDX, and I've got the image, the true things

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
are aligned.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.480
Right, so how do you trace the SPDX back to the image?

22:34.480 --> 22:38.120
So there's extensive checksumming in the SPDX itself.

22:38.120 --> 22:46.840
So every file in that root file system is going to be expressed in the SPDX, and the

22:46.840 --> 22:48.080
SPDX will have its checksum.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.480
So you can say like, you know.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.720
So it's at the file level?

22:50.720 --> 22:51.720
Yeah, at the file level.

22:51.720 --> 22:58.560
So you can say like, userlib foo.so, and then I go look at that, and the SPDX, are the checksums

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
the same?

22:59.560 --> 23:00.560
Then they're valid, right?

23:00.560 --> 23:01.560
So who's using the SPDX?

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
Have you created this image?

23:02.560 --> 23:03.560
Is anybody using the SPDX?

23:03.560 --> 23:08.560
Are you using it?

23:08.560 --> 23:11.800
No, I'm not.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.560
Yeah, sorry.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.280
So he's asking who's using it, and the short answer is I don't know.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.880
A lot of people ask questions about how to generate it, so I assume they're doing something

23:24.880 --> 23:27.400
with it.

23:27.400 --> 23:33.920
But I don't personally generate this yet, but that's just because of where I work, not

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
because of it.

23:34.920 --> 23:40.920
Can you say in relation that there is a list of general health consumption tools that are

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
available?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.960
Yeah, there are a list of, sorry, there is a list of consumption tools available.

23:45.960 --> 23:46.960
Yeah, sorry.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.960
Go ahead, I think you're next.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.960
The build profile stuff, in which the supply chain part, the V looks like the source of

23:48.960 --> 23:59.600
provenance definition, which, do you also look at that solution?

23:59.600 --> 24:07.600
Because what I like about that solution is that it's separate from the software development

24:07.600 --> 24:11.480
material, because it can be consumed in a different way.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.720
Did you ever look into that first version of the specification?

24:15.720 --> 24:17.440
Yeah, so the question is, did we look at Salsa?

24:17.440 --> 24:18.440
Yeah.

24:18.440 --> 24:23.040
We're from Salsa on the build profile working group, so a lot of what Salsa did fed into

24:23.040 --> 24:26.120
what we're doing here.

24:26.120 --> 24:33.600
I think that we wanted it to be more closely integrated with the SPDX core profile, so

24:33.600 --> 24:38.840
that you could say, this is all the licensing information and the build information and

24:38.840 --> 24:45.080
the supply chain information, so that's why we're including a build profile.

24:45.080 --> 24:51.400
I think tooling can come along to, if you wanted to later on, strip out all the build

24:51.400 --> 24:54.680
profile stuff, because you don't want to ship that, you know, ship gigabytes of data to

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
your customers.

24:55.680 --> 25:00.280
Sure, I think tooling can come along to do that, and that should be fairly trivial.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.520
But yeah, that's why we chose to do that that way.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.520
What's the main relationship between the generated SPDX?

25:06.520 --> 25:11.160
Is it the result from the big bake itself, or is the component that's generated the

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
result?

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
Sorry.

25:13.160 --> 25:17.080
I didn't quite understand the question.

25:17.080 --> 25:22.680
Basically, you have one system, the initial source of information that goes to the SPDX.

25:22.680 --> 25:27.440
The initial source will be the big bake recipe?

25:27.440 --> 25:28.440
Correct.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.440
It will be the component itself.

25:30.440 --> 25:35.680
The initial, right, so the question is where does the initial information come from, and

25:35.680 --> 25:39.800
the recipe describes how to build, we report on both, actually.

25:39.800 --> 25:46.280
So we report on the source code, and the recipe, and the thing it built currently.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.520
So we can do all of those things.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.520
And I'm done.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
I'm sorry.

25:51.520 --> 25:54.400
I can answer more questions, if you want.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.400
But I got to...

25:55.400 --> 25:56.400
Thank you very much.
