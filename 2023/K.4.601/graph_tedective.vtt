WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm Linus from the Sustaq Foundation in Europe.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm a

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
developer there and I also work with other projects like Detective, which we want to

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
be an open source solution to make European public tendering data, procurement data,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
explorable for people who don't know that much about procurement data.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
So I want to do a couple of things in this talk.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
First I want to describe why procurement data is interesting, why we should take a look at it.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
And I want to discuss some problems of how this data in EU context is currently accessible.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
And then I want to show you our project of alleviating some of these problems with Detective.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And then I want to show you how you can actually contribute to the project if you find it useful.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Still very much in the early stages and just getting going.

01:02.000 --> 01:16.000
We love the opportunity to show this now so people can actually contribute even in the earlier phase of the project.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
So what's TAT? TAT's in the name. And what's TAT?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So TAT stands for Tenders European Daily.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
And it's basically a data set that's published by the EU Publications Office.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
And they published this data for a long time.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
They've been publishing this for a long time.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Since 2015 actually they've been providing this freely on the internet.

01:43.000 --> 01:54.000
And it's data about basically who buys what from whom. Like which public institutions do you buy what or what tries from which organizations.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
So it's really data about the relationship between business and government.

01:58.000 --> 02:09.000
And if, so for example your local school or some ministry in your country in the EU wants to buy something that's above a certain threshold.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
They're defined in EU legislation. You can look them up in the link here. I will publish the slides afterwards.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It needs to go into TAT. And it will be in this data set.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
And there's at least $670 billion per year in value that's kind of encapsulated in this data.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
And there's more than 700,000 notices that they publish each year.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
That describe this entire process of probably for sure in the EU.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
Sorry Greg, that's something you wanted to...

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
So you could think, well Greg, publish it. So what's the problem with that?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I mean the way this data is read accessible is via this UI.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
One funny thing is, this button statistics mode, I still haven't found out what that does.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Let me show you from the view. You can illuminate.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
But basically you have to really know what you're searching for in the first place in order to be able to use this kind of interface.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
And there's also a lot of other problems with accessing this data.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
For example, you can't really search by organization, which would be interesting.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
I mean it's about the relationship between government and business in follow the money terms.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
So why is there no option to search for organizations that I'm interested in?

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
I can only really do a full text search over these huge XML files, which are really complex.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
And I can do some other stuff, but there's no type of tolerance, for example.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
None of the really nice search features that we've been used to.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
And most importantly, there's no ability at all to readily visualize the results that I get.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
Like if I type something in here in a search mask, I get back a list of HTML,

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
basically just an HTML list of notices that I need to understand what's a notice

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
and what are the different types of notices that I'm interested in.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
So it's really hard.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
It makes a test right now because accessibility is really bad with this data.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So why is the data needed?

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
In the past, there have been a number of attempts to look at this data

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
and transform it into a more manageable or readily analyzable format.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
And we weren't really able to identify a single, freely available solution

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
that was published under a free software license that allows you to explore this data

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
even if you don't have domain expertise or data science expertise.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
And you kind of need both now to be able to make some sense of this data.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And we thought this would be interesting.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
So why isn't this more readily available?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So we applied to last year's EU data form with this idea, basically,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
to make this data more accessible.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And this is what we told them.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
So we have, as any type of, let's say we have a public servant

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
who finds out who buys what from within Germany or within their state,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
who buys from Microsoft, Georgia,

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
and how much they spend on free software from this company.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
And yes, maybe make the case of how much they can save if they use free software.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Or let's say you're a journalist who wants to investigate

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
some of the recent purchases made by a foreign authority.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
You could do that now with a tap interface,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
but very, very difficult.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And you can jump a lot of hurdles to get there.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
So we want to take it as to be an application that you use,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
which lowers the barrier of entry to analyze.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
So we thought let's present the publications of this concept

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
with free software, and it's giving it very simple.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
So we built something roughly with this architecture.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
So you have this XML file,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
and this was very quickly built just for this data.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So I'll go through it quickly.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So we had this XML file.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I transformed it to JSON for whatever reason,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
which was a very bad idea.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And then I parsed it in Python and put it in some ad hoc schema in Postgres.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
And then I used the Neo4j ETL tool to put it to a Neo4j database.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
The data I was interested in was relational data

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
between the chosen relationship between business and government.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And then I used NeoDash to visualize that.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And that actually already gave people a few days

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
a chance to see what might be possible if you open up this data.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
So I'll show you a little demo of how that looked.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So basically this is just an overview.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
I parsed the data for roughly three years, or two and a half years.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
This shows you the activity per country.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
This is just some general overviews,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
like roughly a million vendors.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And then it's not optimized yet.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
You get a, basically you search for Microsoft Germany,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
and then you have this graph.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
You have a geographical distribution of commercial activity

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
that's related to Microsoft.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And you get this nice graph of relationships

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
between Microsoft Germany here in the center as an entity.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And then the yellow or red ones are tenders.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
So here they sold something to some institution of German government,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
in this case here.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Mostly because Microsoft, Deutschland, mostly sells to the German government.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
And the red ones are tenders above one million euro.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
And that gave you a very quick overview

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
of the commercial activity and the relationship

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
between government entities and business entities.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
I do the same with, you get more information here.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You can actually go to the Deutsch website to see the notice

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
that was analyzed.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
A short question.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You search now for Microsoft,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
but usually they work with might be server providers

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
that help to their direct relationship.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Is that something you've been there?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Can we go back to the challenges that we face

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
that you can all help us overcome?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But that's certainly one.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
So again, I do the same with the Polish order authority.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
Here's more like who does an entity buy from

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
over the past two and a half years.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
You can see what kind of like fence and weapon and ammunition stuff they bought.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I mean, I'll have to get through this because,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
yeah, this is actually another problem that I'll talk about

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
towards the end of the talk.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
It's deduplication.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So in TAD data, as it's published in these external files,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
there's no deduplication of entities at all.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So you can have Microsoft, Deutschland, DMP,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Microsoft Deutschland, just Microsoft, whatever that is.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And like you can see here, Microsoft Ireland,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
like there's all these different.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So I did some very naive deduplication attempt.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I also put that data in the Neo4j graph,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
but there's much more to be done on that front.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And it's very interesting problem, I think.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Also because you need to think about it from a policy side as well.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
Like is Microsoft Deutschland a different entity from Microsoft Ireland?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And if yes, what does that mean for my data analysis?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Should I analyze them together?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because they're really operating as one entity.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So there are interesting questions connected to this that are not only technical.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
So let's go back to my...

10:16.000 --> 10:29.000
So that was obviously limited in scope because it was really at all.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
It was pretty main and there were lots of problems with how I find this data for this implementation.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
So now we're at the stage where there's actually a lot of interest in this,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
in the MSAP doing this.

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
I heard from a lot of people that they would be interested in analyzing this data

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
and being able to explore this data.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So what's next and what's already implemented?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
So there's the open contracting data standard,

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
which is something that actually came after TET was first published.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
So I told you already TET was first published in 2015.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I think the OCPS started being developed around 2018, 2019, something like that.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
And if you now build any kind of public procurement platform,

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
you use this data standard because it's just a very nice way for people

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
to put a lot of thought into how can we display this entire process of public procurement?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
How can we put this neatly into a data structure?

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
And so now we're building detectives with this data structure at its core.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
And the first task will be to parse this TET XML jungle

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
into this nicely specified OCPS.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
So I built a relational database that roughly captures OCPS.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
You see a lot of JSON-B in the process there,

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
because some things I didn't, there were many to many or many to one,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
but JSON-B for now makes it much easier.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
Otherwise this table would not have been presented to.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
And now, I mean, this is the graph system step-through after all.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
The next question, because I think analyzing this data,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
analyzing public procurement data, analyzing these relationships between business

12:24.000 --> 12:32.000
and government, this really lends itself to being capsulated in a graph database.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
So this is really the core of OCPS that's interesting,

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
and that would be interesting to model in a graph database like Neo4j.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
You have these tender, like a tender is basically a company says,

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
like we're talking about, we go and the public entity says,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
we want to buy X or Y amount.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
And then an organization, another organization can apply for that.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
They're usually like something commercial.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
They say, look, we can furnish the standard, like we apply for the standard.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And that's interesting data in and of itself,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
who applies for which tenders and which regions and stuff like that.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
And then there's awards.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
That's basically who gets the contract on the wall.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And so that would be a very simple place to start with, with a graph database,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
to just have this, have all the tech data going back from F15,

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
parse it into OCPS, and then take this subset of what's really central

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
and put it into a graph database and really start exploring this visually.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And that's what we want to do.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
And part of it is already done.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
So I'm currently working, we are currently working on parsing this data,

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
this XML, use XML library for that.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It's really nice.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
And I punch this into a relational database.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And I specify the OCPS data schema with SQL model,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
which is really cool for the library.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Basically gives you high-dentic models and SQL LBB models in the one entity.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
It's really cool.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It's really nice to work with.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
And then I want to create CSV export to be then able to input that data

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
and Neo4j, put it back fast if I'm scaffolding around that,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
and then also build some UI, which we are currently researching,

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
which framework to use, and I'm also here to find out which one would be the coolest one.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
So I'll stay here, because I think there will be some problems in the JST.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah, but there's also Reactforce Graph, and yeah,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
it's really like a nice UI that's specifically geared towards that use space

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
of analyzing public procurement data.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
And yeah, then, had the back end backed by these two,

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
like the relational database and the Neo4j database,

15:04.000 --> 15:12.000
and then choose depending on the query which data source you actually use.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
I'll go through the rest really quickly,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
and then I'll go through the rest of the process.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
If you want to get unboarded, the documentation is still up around the edges.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
I'll do my best in the next days and weeks to really make the project approachable to new developers.

15:29.000 --> 15:37.000
What we find is interesting is I want to work with me and the MSP on this.

15:37.000 --> 15:44.000
So some key characteristics that we want to really put a focus on with Detective

15:44.000 --> 15:52.000
is reuse compliant, that means like every file has the license header and copyright header,

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
so that it can really be easily reused.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
And we want to make it for the people, so like a lot of my work in the next weeks

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
will also include speaking to people who analyze public procurement data

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
and ask them what kind of queries they would,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
what kind of questions they would like to ask, because that's really important for the design

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
of the system that you ask people that are later going to use it.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
How could this be helpful?

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
We have done some of that, but we will do way more of that,

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
especially now because we start building the UI.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
And we want it to be interoperable, so everything that the Detective uses,

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
every data that it uses will be also published under RBCC 5.0 license

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
and there will be open API interface, there will be publicly available,

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
obviously some limits get too crazy, but we will think about that when the problem arrives.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And also we fundamentally believe that link data is more interesting,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
because once you have this data in the OCS format,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
you can start making it with other data sources based on

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
if you have an undergrad database, you can start linking it with other data sources.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Things that come to mind would be open corporate data

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
where you can really enrich the data that you have in organizations

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
with data that's in this public database of corporate entities.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
Open sanctions would then allow you to flag people or companies or entities

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
that are on some sanction list and stuff like the offshore leaks database

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
would allow you to highlight things to offshore companies and stuff like that.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
That's a basis for your analysis.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
So this would be a future possibility that I'm really excited about,

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
but the first step is obviously to get this into a nice format

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
and that's to think about extending.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Some of the challenges is re-cleaning this step data,

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
because some of it is quite old, like if you look at data that was published in 2015

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
and there's a lot of typos in there and there's huge XML files

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
that didn't currently do much validation of the forms

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
that were used to take input this data.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.000
So in some places it's very messy.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
And OCS helps a lot actually with starting this data,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
because it's very well defined standard and there's a mapping concept

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
of OCS that some people have published, so it's really cool.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
And then the next big problem that we would be dealt with

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
is depuplication of problem.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
Which I already have online, and yes, we're very cool.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
If you have good ideas on that, I think that's really good.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Because I think that's really central to take the theme helpful.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
So how can you get involved? All the code lives on our git instance.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
At the moment you can only really contribute your PR issues

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
if you make an account and I'll get this free.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
It's just a couple of weeks, but that's fine.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
Nobody manages that and we'll think about mirroring on GitHub.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
But let's try this first. Maybe there's federation coming for the...

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
for the git forges.dariat, as I understand.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
There's also websites with the documentation

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
and then you can also write an e-colon to...

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
this will always reach the retailers.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to your questions.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Thank you very much.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
APPLAUSE

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
That's it.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Regarding funding, did you try to icon-text the official European institution

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
so that you can have funding for this UI

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
and that it becomes like the default UI for that in Europe?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So I know that...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
So the question was whether we asked the publications of this

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
or funding for this.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Not specifically yet.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I know that they are working themselves on a huge reform

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
of the entire ecosystem.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
So they do this, what they call e-forms now,

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
which is supposed to substitute what used to be TED.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But e-forms still isn't OSPS.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
There's discussions around that that I fully understand all the time.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
And they're also rebuilding the TED website.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
We should get the complex with them.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I have the complex because we won this data bomb

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
and we have the... I have taken some context there.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
We should make use of it.

20:48.000 --> 21:16.000
And this will happen.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
It will be all in OSPS format.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Honestly, I don't think anything else makes sense.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
So it's just data that...

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
We will republish this OSPS.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
There's some place like Open Tender, which was a component project

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
which also does this republishing of the data that is OSPS.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
But it's not consistent in how it's regularly uploaded.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
It's not a complex database.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
It doesn't seem very active in any time.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I have a question.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
When you look at these headers and the companies involved,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
are you also able to extract what the action tender is about?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
So is there an analyzed structure?

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
This is about, I don't know, classroom, furniture,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and this is about military equipment.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
So that you can correlate, or by item,

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
or by contract project?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
Should I repeat the question?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
So the question was whether there's also data about

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
what is being procured and details about what's being procured

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
by public institutions.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And the answer is yes.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
There's usually a title that's fairly descriptive.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
And a description, sometimes in English, sometimes in other words.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
And then there's CPD codes, which is a common procurement vocabulary

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
that specifies what kind of category this procurement is in.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But some stuff is excluded by this legislation.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
For example, like military personnel is not published in this data.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Sorry, can't talk about open procurement in the context yet

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
because there's still lots of sensitive data

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
that's not being included in that.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Do you plan to host it publicly?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Do we plan to host it publicly?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Yes, yes, absolutely.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
It's just at the moment the API is down because I re-vector it.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
So many things.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
But it will be.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
It will be after again.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah, of course it will be publicly available,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
but if everything crashes because there's so much interest in it,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
then we'll have to think about limiting it somehow.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
But there's a system.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Exactly, yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
So we'll see, you know, if there's really that much interest.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I have a question.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
What have been the biggest challenges you've had

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
when you did a new university?

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
So what was the biggest challenge in cleaning the data?

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
So I would say one is just finding if there is an English translation available,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
finding that for the specific, because we really lay out in this XML file

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
that we can translate around and where is, if a translation exists,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
like where is it in XML?

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
Like what other, like what does it apply to?

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
Another one was languages that I didn't know the alphabet of,

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
the hard to parse, and yeah, that just in general,

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
that company names that they didn't have for a long time,

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
I mean any validation on what you could put in there,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
which makes it really hard.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
It would have been very easy to implement upstream,

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
but now it's because you found space.

24:54.000 --> 25:01.000
Thank you.

25:01.000 --> 25:19.000
.
