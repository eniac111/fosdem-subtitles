1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:15.520
So my name is Joz, I'm a co-founder of Nextcloud and I talk about Nextcloud aka I do marketing.

2
0:00:15.520 --> 0:00:17.980
And today I'm going to talk about what's new in Nextcloud.

3
0:00:17.980 --> 0:00:23.440
Now this became a little bit of a mess because we usually do about three releases a year

4
0:00:23.440 --> 0:00:27.040
and I kind of made up three releases here but there are actually only two.

5
0:00:27.040 --> 0:00:30.920
I just mixed up our own product naming so that was a good one.

6
0:00:30.920 --> 0:00:37.160
I hope nobody is confused but we'll simplify it going forward.

7
0:00:37.160 --> 0:00:41.800
So I will simply go over the products and what's new.

8
0:00:41.800 --> 0:00:45.720
As I said I can't talk about all the features because this is just what's new which is already

9
0:00:45.720 --> 0:00:49.760
as I said 84 slides although we're already on the third so we'll get there don't worry.

10
0:00:49.760 --> 0:00:51.560
I'll do my best at least.

11
0:00:51.560 --> 0:00:55.440
So Nextcloud Hub 2 there was somewhere in March, April.

12
0:00:55.440 --> 0:00:59.720
We introduced user migration that's the first thing I'm going to show.

13
0:00:59.720 --> 0:01:04.880
File locking, automated file locking, load database load, always performance that's always

14
0:01:04.880 --> 0:01:07.160
important I think.

15
0:01:07.160 --> 0:01:12.680
Improvements in talk, desktop integration and a couple of improvements in the group

16
0:01:12.680 --> 0:01:13.920
ware app.

17
0:01:13.920 --> 0:01:16.800
Now I'm going to try and show a couple of these things but there's not a lot to show

18
0:01:16.800 --> 0:01:21.240
or of user migration it basically does what the name suggests.

19
0:01:21.240 --> 0:01:24.280
You can export your account.

20
0:01:24.280 --> 0:01:27.760
This depends a little bit on what the app supports so we have support in a couple of

21
0:01:27.760 --> 0:01:32.240
the important apps like for example files and it'll of course not just export your files

22
0:01:32.240 --> 0:01:36.800
but also the comments on the files, activity history, what your favorite files are so these

23
0:01:36.800 --> 0:01:38.280
metadata gets exported.

24
0:01:38.280 --> 0:01:43.160
Of course your account itself gets exported so you know your profile name and picture

25
0:01:43.160 --> 0:01:47.520
and date all this stuff and the idea is that you can export your account and then go to

26
0:01:47.520 --> 0:01:50.360
another Nextcloud server and import it there.

27
0:01:50.360 --> 0:01:54.800
Nextcloud is hosted by tons of companies as well as on your own and if you say look my

28
0:01:54.800 --> 0:01:58.920
Raspberry Pi isn't pulling it anymore I need something a little faster then you can move

29
0:01:58.920 --> 0:02:01.080
to something bigger.

30
0:02:01.080 --> 0:02:07.400
So yeah apps need to support this so it has some limitations but you can just choose what

31
0:02:07.400 --> 0:02:12.600
you want to turn on so you can say okay export only my files or export files and my email

32
0:02:12.600 --> 0:02:16.000
configuration export this don't export that.

33
0:02:16.000 --> 0:02:20.120
It's fairly simple just download to a zip file.

34
0:02:20.120 --> 0:02:24.600
So what else is new in Nextcloud files we worked a ton on performance I'll get to that

35
0:02:24.600 --> 0:02:25.680
in a minute.

36
0:02:25.680 --> 0:02:30.280
We introduced a search API for indexing that's basically an API for an external indexing

37
0:02:30.280 --> 0:02:35.200
tool like Elasticsearch that can then index the content on Nextcloud and show it to you.

38
0:02:35.200 --> 0:02:40.120
Somebody for open project there looked very happy excellent and we introduced kind of

39
0:02:40.120 --> 0:02:44.040
a little thing but if you share something by mail you can then give it a password and

40
0:02:44.040 --> 0:02:48.280
then email them the password but of course well they already have something kind of unique

41
0:02:48.280 --> 0:02:52.760
which is their email address so we now have a token option that they can simply say hey

42
0:02:52.760 --> 0:02:56.760
I have this email address they will receive a timed token and then they can log in you

43
0:02:56.760 --> 0:03:00.480
don't need to give them a password or something like that.

44
0:03:00.480 --> 0:03:04.960
So I mentioned performance and there are tons of things basically too much to talk about

45
0:03:04.960 --> 0:03:08.960
so I have a couple of details that are just semi randomly picked out.

46
0:03:08.960 --> 0:03:16.880
If you view a folder in this release we got the number of database queries down by 75%.

47
0:03:16.880 --> 0:03:22.520
You can configure cron jobs so you have this background jobs that are running and you know

48
0:03:22.520 --> 0:03:29.200
if you have a very busy server and the cron job hits just at your most busy time that

49
0:03:29.200 --> 0:03:32.600
might not be helpful so these background jobs you can now configure a little bit that you

50
0:03:32.600 --> 0:03:37.800
say hey this is a very heavy task please don't do this at like 11 o'clock or at 9 o'clock

51
0:03:37.800 --> 0:03:40.400
when all the employees log in for example.

52
0:03:40.400 --> 0:03:45.280
So there's a bit more configurability there and it also turned out that our server was

53
0:03:45.280 --> 0:03:50.920
very busy generating avatars in different sizes like one application for next cloud

54
0:03:50.920 --> 0:03:55.640
set can I have it at 65 by 65 pixels the next one wanted 66 by 66.

55
0:03:55.640 --> 0:04:00.600
This is actually a ton of work so we now just offer it in a few sizes and then you know

56
0:04:00.600 --> 0:04:04.560
you can resize it in the browser I mean that works fine and that made quite a difference

57
0:04:04.560 --> 0:04:06.640
you'd be surprised.

58
0:04:06.640 --> 0:04:11.760
What we also did is we separated image preview generation so if you have you know 100,000

59
0:04:11.760 --> 0:04:17.400
photos and you want to scroll in that folder then the next cloud server gets very very

60
0:04:17.400 --> 0:04:22.640
busy generating about 100,000 previews in of course multiple sizes if you do that in

61
0:04:22.640 --> 0:04:27.800
advance that's very nice but then that means your server is simply busy at another time

62
0:04:27.800 --> 0:04:32.480
so what you can do now is you can have an external service that does this so it runs

63
0:04:32.480 --> 0:04:36.280
on a separate server it doesn't bug down your primary next cloud server.

64
0:04:36.280 --> 0:04:41.240
It's little things makes quite a difference now I mentioned file permissions so one thing

65
0:04:41.240 --> 0:04:46.200
we also did is just we made the permissions a little more well advanced and you can very

66
0:04:46.200 --> 0:04:51.440
specifically pick out if you don't just give edit rights but you can say I want you give

67
0:04:51.440 --> 0:04:57.560
the ability to upload but not edit or not delete etc.

68
0:04:57.560 --> 0:05:02.040
Other improvements were like searching for files by the tag of the file, improved group

69
0:05:02.040 --> 0:05:08.120
folders you can now use the viewer app on public links so you share somebody a PDF or

70
0:05:08.120 --> 0:05:13.280
an image and then they can use our internal viewer app on that public link and lots of

71
0:05:13.280 --> 0:05:16.320
other little things there.

72
0:05:16.320 --> 0:05:22.120
So the next step in X.Hub 2 was groupware we did just a couple of features a lot of

73
0:05:22.120 --> 0:05:27.760
under the hood work the features are just a few one is accept and decline directly in

74
0:05:27.760 --> 0:05:31.040
the calendar app that just makes a little quicker you already then see the calendar

75
0:05:31.040 --> 0:05:33.440
item you can just accept it and decline it.

76
0:05:33.440 --> 0:05:38.720
What we did in the mail app is we introduced the ability to send an email later and to

77
0:05:38.720 --> 0:05:43.520
undo send so you have 30 seconds to realize that well you were a little too quick with

78
0:05:43.520 --> 0:05:45.920
that email.

79
0:05:45.920 --> 0:05:52.120
In talk we did again under the hood work also introducing reactions which is of course always

80
0:05:52.120 --> 0:05:58.880
nice to zoom into then we did a media tab and we integrate in the desktop client so

81
0:05:58.880 --> 0:06:02.720
when you get you know talk notification you can click there and the latest version of

82
0:06:02.720 --> 0:06:07.280
the desktop client is even better because if you get like this operating system notification

83
0:06:07.280 --> 0:06:10.880
you can just click reply there and then right there already answer.

84
0:06:10.880 --> 0:06:16.120
Lisa works on Mac OS and think on Windows I'm not sure if Linux has that feature maybe

85
0:06:16.120 --> 0:06:21.840
not yet but it's kind of cool and well here's the obligatory zoom in.

86
0:06:21.840 --> 0:06:02.720
With this release we introduce a new user interface in Next

87
0:06:24.240 --> 0:06:29.000
Out Office so well things fairly obvious we tried to make a little more familiar for

88
0:06:29.000 --> 0:06:33.720
people who are migrating from certain other office applications it's optional you can

89
0:06:33.720 --> 0:06:38.480
configure it as user but I think this yeah just makes it nicer.

90
0:06:38.480 --> 0:06:44.240
Honestly I like the UI a bit more myself I use it now so the last menus to search through.

91
0:06:44.240 --> 0:06:47.840
And the nice thing is we introduced file locking already a while ago so if you're working with

92
0:06:47.840 --> 0:06:51.960
somebody else and it's like not a file you can edit the next file but it's a Photoshop

93
0:06:51.960 --> 0:06:56.280
file for example you need to download it edit it I'll get back to how we made that easier

94
0:06:56.280 --> 0:07:00.920
to later but with this release we made file locking automatic so if you're in Next Out

95
0:07:00.920 --> 0:07:04.840
Office you edit the file then it gets locked so that your colleague isn't on the desktop

96
0:07:04.840 --> 0:07:10.440
client locally editing it at the same time and creating conflicts but instead desktop

97
0:07:10.440 --> 0:07:15.240
client will then say this file is being edited online please don't edit it locally.

98
0:07:15.240 --> 0:07:18.160
Depends a bit on the operating system whether a desktop client can enforce this or only

99
0:07:18.160 --> 0:07:23.960
give warnings because on Windows it's impossible to edit a file which is open on Linux this

100
0:07:23.960 --> 0:07:29.600
is not a problem because it's a proper operating system but it gives you a warning then so

101
0:07:29.600 --> 0:07:33.680
at least you know that you're breaking something and then you can of course also right click

102
0:07:33.680 --> 0:07:38.320
on the file on desktop client and lock the file it shows you who has locked the file

103
0:07:38.320 --> 0:07:43.320
if it's locked by an application it'll not say the name of whoever it was but it'll

104
0:07:43.320 --> 0:07:47.080
say the name of the application so you can see on Next Out Text is locking this file

105
0:07:47.080 --> 0:07:51.160
so people are editing it on the browser now of course in desktop client can just right

106
0:07:51.160 --> 0:07:55.720
click and say open in the browser then it just opens the browser window with that file

107
0:07:55.720 --> 0:08:00.120
and meet the editing so you can just join the editing session so it shouldn't block

108
0:08:00.120 --> 0:08:04.680
you for anything that was already up too I'm gonna get to the next one this has a few more

109
0:08:04.680 --> 0:08:09.480
slides than the other one and also a lot more features well you can read I'm just gonna

110
0:08:09.480 --> 0:08:15.400
show it to you so first thing we did actually was to introduce a new design so well it's

111
0:08:15.400 --> 0:08:20.720
more rounded and it also shows you your wallpaper through so people can you know pick a favorite

112
0:08:20.720 --> 0:08:28.680
wallpaper and then you can see through this wallpaper another benefit let me see yeah

113
0:08:28.680 --> 0:08:34.160
we're back another thing is we also worked a lot on accessibility so you have a nicer

114
0:08:34.160 --> 0:08:41.520
even nicer dark mode you can also set forms for people who have problems with while reading

115
0:08:41.520 --> 0:08:48.060
this lecture yeah dark mode can also switch automatically now and a whole ton of other

116
0:08:48.060 --> 0:08:52.800
changes if you use a different background well I can show you some more screenshots

117
0:08:52.800 --> 0:08:57.560
if you like it bubbly maybe you like a little darker you know that's for the real hackers

118
0:08:57.560 --> 0:09:03.000
dark mode with a dark background I now realize that even though I'm not a hacker I do run

119
0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:09.640
this background by default I like it either way well we also did is once again performance

120
0:09:09.640 --> 0:09:13.760
I can once again of course go in all the details but let me quickly first cover security which

121
0:09:13.760 --> 0:09:20.680
we also work on for every release if you use a server side encryption we allow you to

122
0:09:20.680 --> 0:09:27.160
encrypt S3 based primary storage object storage encrypt encryption that works with group folders

123
0:09:27.160 --> 0:09:32.960
which are used a lot and it takes 33% less storage so it used to be there encryption

124
0:09:32.960 --> 0:09:37.560
algorithm really blew up the size of the files by about a third and now well that's gone

125
0:09:37.560 --> 0:09:43.200
so it gets smaller again and a couple of occ commands to manage the encryption on the client

126
0:09:43.200 --> 0:09:46.800
side we also made a bunch of improvements with user end-to-end encryption in the in

127
0:09:46.800 --> 0:09:51.640
the desktop client and the mobile clients it's faster that was very helpful other people

128
0:09:51.640 --> 0:09:55.960
complained with a lot of files it was slow which it was we also made key management a

129
0:09:55.960 --> 0:10:00.860
little nicer so you can also in the browser reset your keys that also means you lose access

130
0:10:00.860 --> 0:10:05.560
to all your files if you forgot your password but you can start over if you made a mistake

131
0:10:05.560 --> 0:10:11.600
or forgot your password and administrative administrators can then say groups of users

132
0:10:11.600 --> 0:10:15.280
or individual users can give them access to the end-to-end encryption or not so it can

133
0:10:15.280 --> 0:10:20.800
be controlled as well I mentioned performance there was tons of stuff I think in core alone

134
0:10:20.800 --> 0:10:25.120
we did 33 separate improvements I'm not going to show all of them I'm just going to pick

135
0:10:25.120 --> 0:10:33.880
out a few of them otherwise it gets a little crazy so sorting of files went a ton faster

136
0:10:33.880 --> 0:10:38.240
because we only sort the recently changed files it's a little thing but if you're in

137
0:10:38.240 --> 0:10:42.880
a folder with tons of files and you want to sort all of them why would you do that if

138
0:10:42.880 --> 0:10:47.640
you just need to sort the newest on top only look at the newer files it's little things

139
0:10:47.640 --> 0:10:54.360
but it gets a lot faster search became about seven times faster and all these things they

140
0:10:54.360 --> 0:10:59.040
add up because by now if you do a prop find which is kind of operation that a client checks

141
0:10:59.040 --> 0:11:05.040
hey has anything changed on the server that is now about 30% faster so you know it's it's

142
0:11:05.040 --> 0:11:08.640
really common operations they don't get of course a seven time speed up but all these

143
0:11:08.640 --> 0:11:14.680
seven times and little things they add up to well 20 30% if you upgrade to this release

144
0:11:14.680 --> 0:11:18.560
you should really notice it because pages load about a third faster and I think that's

145
0:11:18.560 --> 0:11:24.840
kind of where you notice a difference yourself so anyway that's really good stuff there now

146
0:11:24.840 --> 0:11:30.360
let's talk about the features next I'll talk so we introduced pulse I mean that's really

147
0:11:30.360 --> 0:11:36.200
nice also a couple of other things for example you now have what we call widgets if you can

148
0:11:36.200 --> 0:11:40.400
share if you share a deck card you can then see the information of the deck card this

149
0:11:40.400 --> 0:11:44.720
also works with github tickets it works with youtube videos it works with tons of other

150
0:11:44.720 --> 0:11:51.600
stuff even maps locations and such and that also shows in the media bar on the site that

151
0:11:51.600 --> 0:11:57.360
we introduced in the previous release so I think that's really quite nice we introduced

152
0:11:57.360 --> 0:12:02.600
the ability to basically start a call but not send a notification to everybody so if

153
0:12:02.600 --> 0:12:07.200
you're in a big group and you want to have a call with only three members you can start

154
0:12:07.200 --> 0:12:11.460
a call but then not for 60 people their phones are ringing that might be a little annoying

155
0:12:11.460 --> 0:12:15.160
you can do the same with sending messages so you can send the message but if you do

156
0:12:15.160 --> 0:12:19.240
this Saturday night you shouldn't bother your entire team they all get a ping on their phone

157
0:12:19.240 --> 0:12:23.400
because it's bloody weekend why do you do this maybe shouldn't be working but if you

158
0:12:23.400 --> 0:12:28.280
do then at least you can send it without generating notifications of course in next round you

159
0:12:28.280 --> 0:12:33.440
can also configure your availability and just say outside of these hours please put me

160
0:12:33.440 --> 0:12:38.840
out to medically and do not disturb that also helps but still you can control this but then

161
0:12:38.840 --> 0:12:42.040
of course you might actually want to send somebody call notification because you're

162
0:12:42.040 --> 0:12:45.080
in the call with three people you want number four then you can actually ring their phone

163
0:12:45.080 --> 0:12:53.800
this way directly so all the way around we also introduce message expiration the widgets

164
0:12:53.800 --> 0:12:58.800
that I just already mentioned also works then with YouTube we can also directly now create

165
0:12:58.800 --> 0:13:03.480
files and a ton of different ones the poll I already mentioned but also create a new

166
0:13:03.480 --> 0:13:07.600
document and then it just opens up as immediately shared with everybody can immediately start

167
0:13:07.600 --> 0:13:14.320
editing your office document or whatever you created so that's nice and in a classroom

168
0:13:14.320 --> 0:13:19.920
or a webinar you might sometimes want to stop people from talking and we expended the access

169
0:13:19.920 --> 0:13:24.800
rights with this as well so you can now say okay you know you can't post messages you

170
0:13:24.800 --> 0:13:32.480
cannot react you know no talking until well it's time to open that we also work for scalability

171
0:13:32.480 --> 0:13:36.720
quite a bit we introduce clustering to the high performance back end so for bigger calls

172
0:13:36.720 --> 0:13:42.360
but honestly we don't use clustering ourselves we're now using it for webinars we had 350

173
0:13:42.360 --> 0:13:46.520
people couple weeks ago so that works still on one server but there is of course a point

174
0:13:46.520 --> 0:13:50.320
that you want to have a call with even more people and then you need clustering and that's

175
0:13:50.320 --> 0:13:56.440
helpful all right let's talk about group fare for a minute there's always makes for nice

176
0:13:56.440 --> 0:14:02.440
screenshots so we introduced a nice org chart in our contacts app you just define who is

177
0:14:02.440 --> 0:14:06.200
the boss of who and then it creates a graph that you can zoom in and out and all this

178
0:14:06.200 --> 0:14:11.480
stuff very simple but it's nice was done by a community projects was supported by the

179
0:14:11.480 --> 0:14:20.840
EU so yay for our EU overlords here in Brussels yeah the mail app also got a nice overhaul

180
0:14:20.840 --> 0:14:26.120
mostly UI improvements I'll get to a couple of features in a minute well that's actually

181
0:14:26.120 --> 0:14:32.680
right now so less than a minute you can have now images in your signatures you can configure

182
0:14:32.680 --> 0:14:38.040
an outer responder directly in next cloud and we made the UI of the appointment booking

183
0:14:38.040 --> 0:14:43.560
so this is kind of like Calendly I guess that's been a feature in except for a while and we

184
0:14:43.560 --> 0:14:47.640
improved the UI a little so you can create certain dates and times that people can book

185
0:14:47.640 --> 0:14:52.840
meetings with you also updated the create new account wizard attachment viewer is now

186
0:14:52.840 --> 0:14:58.600
right in mail so if you have a PDF just click it you can view it IMAP invite support so

187
0:14:58.600 --> 0:15:02.640
in an email you get an invitation for the calendar you just click accept and then you're

188
0:15:02.640 --> 0:15:08.000
in there etc so all good stuff let's get to office as I have less than 10 minutes left

189
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:13.480
I know it's terrible so what did we do yeah you can upload custom fonts that's actually

190
0:15:13.480 --> 0:15:18.360
super helpful because half the documents that looks yet in a clever online slash next at

191
0:15:18.360 --> 0:15:22.480
office just look bad because of the fonts it's very simple in many cases that's the

192
0:15:22.480 --> 0:15:26.960
problem with it and well you can now easily out your fonts in the UI what you can also

193
0:15:26.960 --> 0:15:32.400
do is if a document still looks bad or if it uses like really weird features that require

194
0:15:32.400 --> 0:15:36.760
like local data connections between documents and this stuff there's now a button on the

195
0:15:36.760 --> 0:15:42.480
top left that says open locally you click on it it said are you sure you say yes if

196
0:15:42.480 --> 0:15:48.900
you are and then it'll just lock the file open it on your desktop in Microsoft Office

197
0:15:48.900 --> 0:15:53.760
for example or LibreOffice on your desktop you edit it you close it syncs it back to

198
0:15:53.760 --> 0:15:58.540
the server and unlocks the file this is awesome perfect compatibility because whatever you

199
0:15:58.540 --> 0:16:02.680
run locally works obviously this also works for your Photoshop files so you just go and

200
0:16:02.680 --> 0:16:07.360
next out you look up the file you click the three dot menu you click open locally Photoshop

201
0:16:07.360 --> 0:16:11.840
opens when you're done you close it it unlocks the file again and your colleagues can work

202
0:16:11.840 --> 0:16:16.960
again with it too so fairly simple the button is like the one that next to the save button

203
0:16:16.960 --> 0:16:24.760
the third one top left right we also have this app called collectives it's a knowledge

204
0:16:24.760 --> 0:16:31.120
base application we introduced a whole bunch of improvements like an outline that you see

205
0:16:31.120 --> 0:16:36.520
on the left here and tons of other stuff honestly I need to speed up a little bit so I will

206
0:16:36.520 --> 0:16:40.240
skip through most of this but it's a lot of good stuff believe me you can add mentioned

207
0:16:40.240 --> 0:16:44.720
colleagues you can search for the content of these things in Universal search and the

208
0:16:44.720 --> 0:16:49.960
widgets work as well so you can if you have a link to a github issue or to a youtube video

209
0:16:49.960 --> 0:16:55.160
then it just shows you right there the content and here are the fonts by the way I just mentioned

210
0:16:55.160 --> 0:17:01.120
so you can upload them nice and easy next up photos really cool we introduced photo

211
0:17:01.120 --> 0:17:05.520
albums so you can create a photo album and put photos in there without having to you

212
0:17:05.520 --> 0:17:11.360
know actually move them around you can invite other people to it and share them with them

213
0:17:11.360 --> 0:17:16.440
then we introduced image recognition so there's an AI neural network thingy no we're not

214
0:17:16.440 --> 0:17:21.000
sending it to Google it's running local on your server and it'll recognize different

215
0:17:21.000 --> 0:17:27.080
objects it'll recognize different faces different people text them and then you can find them

216
0:17:27.080 --> 0:17:31.320
by text I'll show you a bit more screenshots later super cool also introduce the photo

217
0:17:31.320 --> 0:17:35.280
editor so you can rotate crop and you know some filters all the basic stuff for your

218
0:17:35.280 --> 0:17:44.040
photos so you know Google killed photos so you can move over now I was trying to well

219
0:17:44.040 --> 0:17:48.640
I have lots of more zoom instincts but you have a nice uploader now that shows you here

220
0:17:48.640 --> 0:17:52.840
are the faces that it automatically recognized and then you can click one and then you go

221
0:17:52.840 --> 0:17:57.920
well and you see all the pictures of that person yeah it's fairly simple can even recognize

222
0:17:57.920 --> 0:18:03.120
music genres obviously not in the photos app but in the music app to be clear but it's

223
0:18:03.120 --> 0:18:07.840
really cool and again it's not using a database it's using machine learning so it really looks

224
0:18:07.840 --> 0:18:12.620
well listens in this case and figures out the genre I don't know how good it is I've

225
0:18:12.620 --> 0:18:17.640
heard it's actually surprisingly good so you know really cool and again all this is on

226
0:18:17.640 --> 0:18:23.680
your server no data is sent anywhere else unlike the big clouds even works on the Raspberry

227
0:18:23.680 --> 0:18:30.400
Pi so that's pretty cool I think on the clients we really did a ton of work for this release

228
0:18:30.400 --> 0:18:34.640
you can of course edit files also on your tablet right next to the office will work

229
0:18:34.640 --> 0:18:42.800
on your tablet or your phone etc but we also introduced widgets so you have these widgets

230
0:18:42.800 --> 0:18:47.160
when you open next cloud you have the dashboard these widgets are now also on your tablets

231
0:18:47.160 --> 0:18:51.880
and on your phone if you want them they use the native widgets iOS widgets so you have

232
0:18:51.880 --> 0:18:56.680
these widgets on iOS where you can have next cloud widgets from your dashboard on your

233
0:18:56.680 --> 0:19:02.920
phone on your tablet etc really cool I think I think I have some examples here exactly

234
0:19:02.920 --> 0:19:13.000
so your files notifications changes files shared with you etc on Windows you now get

235
0:19:13.000 --> 0:19:18.000
this so if you have a virtual file system on Windows so you're not syncing all the files

236
0:19:18.000 --> 0:19:21.520
but you view them and when you click them they get synced but at least you get previews

237
0:19:21.520 --> 0:19:29.000
in the meantime that's new as well quite nice androids few improvements iOS improvements

238
0:19:29.000 --> 0:19:33.680
as well I will not go into details because we are really getting there yeah those were

239
0:19:33.680 --> 0:19:42.360
the widgets two other nice things in the last two minutes I think I have left we made it

240
0:19:42.360 --> 0:19:46.960
a lot easier to get next cloud so there has been a docker image for next cloud for a long

241
0:19:46.960 --> 0:19:53.400
time and this was a kind of IKEA inspired docker image I would say you had to bring your

242
0:19:53.400 --> 0:19:57.800
own database and your own file system and your own you know so you're really setting

243
0:19:57.800 --> 0:20:01.720
up like a bunch of docker images it's very nice if you're really into Kubernetes and

244
0:20:01.720 --> 0:20:05.760
this stuff if you've never heard of Kubernetes like most people we now have an all-in-one

245
0:20:05.760 --> 0:20:10.920
docker image you just download this one docker image and well it'll give you a nice overview

246
0:20:10.920 --> 0:20:16.480
it runs all the other containers in there it's super easy to use we even did a because

247
0:20:16.480 --> 0:20:21.440
we made a VM version of it just VM we've done this docker image running in it on Ubuntu

248
0:20:21.440 --> 0:20:25.560
I think which you can then run on Windows if you want so now suddenly next cloud is

249
0:20:25.560 --> 0:20:32.320
available for Windows Server if you so wish it's still running Linux obviously right it's

250
0:20:32.320 --> 0:20:38.200
not going crazy here but even as backup by the way built in bork backup there is by the

251
0:20:38.200 --> 0:20:42.600
way next out backup app but that's using something completely different that allows you to back

252
0:20:42.600 --> 0:20:48.200
up to another next cloud server times up I have to tell you by the way that you can this

253
0:20:48.200 --> 0:20:53.040
deploy this all-in-one container with one click on these platforms so if you really

254
0:20:53.040 --> 0:20:57.100
love the clouds but you want a little more control you can still run next cloud on any

255
0:20:57.100 --> 0:21:00.880
of these with one two clicks and then you have a deployed there so we're in their app

256
0:21:00.880 --> 0:21:06.920
stores basically not all of them are fully finished yet but we're working on it we'll

257
0:21:06.920 --> 0:21:13.120
get there anyway questions sorry only a few seconds over time it's not so bad questions

258
0:21:13.120 --> 0:21:20.320
come on yeah sorry co-authoring co-authoring of a document so you mean collaborative editing

259
0:21:20.320 --> 0:21:24.920
yes absolutely so in next art office but also next attacks are note-taking and also the

260
0:21:24.920 --> 0:21:29.000
knowledge base so if you're editing a knowledge base document you can do it with 20 people

261
0:21:29.000 --> 0:21:38.000
if you like I mean I don't know why you would so well on iOS and the Android and iOS apps

262
0:21:38.000 --> 0:21:42.160
they do it but on the desktop client not that would open in a browser so you do right click

263
0:21:42.160 --> 0:21:48.440
you say add a document and it opens a browser window and then you're in there yeah does

264
0:21:48.440 --> 0:21:53.680
it support does the noise base support markdown yes it is markdown it dreams markdown it lives

265
0:21:53.680 --> 0:21:58.200
markdown everything is marked down while they're in the next at office but it's an extra text

266
0:21:58.200 --> 0:22:02.960
but then in a different way so it has these widgets all the other stuff just like text

267
0:22:02.960 --> 0:22:08.160
they're basically I don't know it's like text but then with a sidebar that lets you search

268
0:22:08.160 --> 0:22:17.200
and you know choose and link to other documents it's just text and steroids yes can you talk

269
0:22:17.200 --> 0:22:21.800
about our service yes multiple ways but next I'll have a federation feature so you can

270
0:22:21.800 --> 0:22:27.700
share a file to the server of your friend yeah so next I'll talk no at the moment talk

271
0:22:27.700 --> 0:22:43.200
is not federated it's something we want to do but I don't have an eta for you next the

272
0:22:43.200 --> 0:22:49.840
photos app is the default photos app with the recognition everything yes yeah yeah for

273
0:22:49.840 --> 0:22:56.560
the recognition of faces because you need to download a gigantic you know AI thing

274
0:22:56.560 --> 0:23:01.680
file there you need to separately install the recognize app and that's about I don't

275
0:23:01.680 --> 0:23:04.720
know I think it's a gigabyte plus because it needs to download this network that can

276
0:23:04.720 --> 0:23:12.000
recognize your pictures or your server it has arm and x86 which should work most places

277
0:23:12.000 --> 0:23:21.040
but this is a separate action but the photos app itself is there yes collect this you mean

278
0:23:21.040 --> 0:23:25.560
the what do you mean with local content you mean you can insert a file in there yes you

279
0:23:25.560 --> 0:23:29.960
can yes enter file document files from next cloud of course if it's not on next cloud

280
0:23:29.960 --> 0:23:43.400
it'll upload it and put it in a same folder yes no not yet but that's something we would

281
0:23:43.400 --> 0:23:48.160
want to do so the forms app you have next out forms apps like Google forms but then

282
0:23:48.160 --> 0:23:56.360
you're not giving all your data to evil America company yeah and the question was can multiple

283
0:23:56.360 --> 0:24:00.960
people see and manage the same form and there's unfortunately not yet possible so the person

284
0:24:00.960 --> 0:24:06.240
who creates the form they can export the data in a spreadsheet but they can currently not

285
0:24:06.240 --> 0:24:16.200
yet give management to other people we'll get there yes yeah yeah

286
0:24:16.200 --> 0:24:23.800
no how many people can see each other so you can control access rights and if you have

287
0:24:23.800 --> 0:24:29.000
infinite network bandwidth and everybody can see everybody in the real world no and it's

288
0:24:29.000 --> 0:24:38.240
purely depends on your network bandwidth here I think the grid view goes to 20 people or

289
0:24:38.240 --> 0:24:43.600
so beyond that you start to scroll to the next page next page but I believe it scales

290
0:24:43.600 --> 0:24:48.800
with the size of your monitor if I have a gigantic monitor on a high resolution again

291
0:24:48.800 --> 0:24:54.720
no it's open source and it's self hosted you are always the limiting factor believe me

292
0:24:54.720 --> 0:25:08.840
it's anything else local talk clients no so we've Android and iOS client for talk at

293
0:25:08.840 --> 0:25:18.440
the moment but stay tuned that's it awesome thank you for being here everybody

294
0:25:18.440 --> 0:25:42.560
always the limiting factor
