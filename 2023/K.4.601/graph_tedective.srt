1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
I'm Linus from the Sustaq Foundation in Europe.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:02.000
I'm a

3
0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:15.000
developer there and I also work with other projects like Detective, which we want to

4
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:22.000
be an open source solution to make European public tendering data, procurement data,

5
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:27.000
explorable for people who don't know that much about procurement data.

6
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:31.000
So I want to do a couple of things in this talk.

7
0:00:31.000 --> 0:00:39.000
First I want to describe why procurement data is interesting, why we should take a look at it.

8
0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:48.000
And I want to discuss some problems of how this data in EU context is currently accessible.

9
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:54.000
And then I want to show you our project of alleviating some of these problems with Detective.

10
0:00:54.000 --> 0:00:59.000
And then I want to show you how you can actually contribute to the project if you find it useful.

11
0:00:59.000 --> 0:01:02.000
Still very much in the early stages and just getting going.

12
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:16.000
We love the opportunity to show this now so people can actually contribute even in the earlier phase of the project.

13
0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:21.000
So what's TAT? TAT's in the name. And what's TAT?

14
0:01:21.000 --> 0:01:25.000
So TAT stands for Tenders European Daily.

15
0:01:25.000 --> 0:01:32.000
And it's basically a data set that's published by the EU Publications Office.

16
0:01:32.000 --> 0:01:36.000
And they published this data for a long time.

17
0:01:36.000 --> 0:01:38.000
They've been publishing this for a long time.

18
0:01:38.000 --> 0:01:43.000
Since 2015 actually they've been providing this freely on the internet.

19
0:01:43.000 --> 0:01:54.000
And it's data about basically who buys what from whom. Like which public institutions do you buy what or what tries from which organizations.

20
0:01:54.000 --> 0:01:58.000
So it's really data about the relationship between business and government.

21
0:01:58.000 --> 0:02:09.000
And if, so for example your local school or some ministry in your country in the EU wants to buy something that's above a certain threshold.

22
0:02:09.000 --> 0:02:15.000
They're defined in EU legislation. You can look them up in the link here. I will publish the slides afterwards.

23
0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:19.000
It needs to go into TAT. And it will be in this data set.

24
0:02:19.000 --> 0:02:28.000
And there's at least $670 billion per year in value that's kind of encapsulated in this data.

25
0:02:28.000 --> 0:02:36.000
And there's more than 700,000 notices that they publish each year.

26
0:02:36.000 --> 0:02:43.000
That describe this entire process of probably for sure in the EU.

27
0:02:43.000 --> 0:02:51.000
Sorry Greg, that's something you wanted to...

28
0:02:51.000 --> 0:02:58.000
So you could think, well Greg, publish it. So what's the problem with that?

29
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:03.000
I mean the way this data is read accessible is via this UI.

30
0:03:03.000 --> 0:03:11.000
One funny thing is, this button statistics mode, I still haven't found out what that does.

31
0:03:11.000 --> 0:03:16.000
Let me show you from the view. You can illuminate.

32
0:03:16.000 --> 0:03:23.000
But basically you have to really know what you're searching for in the first place in order to be able to use this kind of interface.

33
0:03:23.000 --> 0:03:29.000
And there's also a lot of other problems with accessing this data.

34
0:03:29.000 --> 0:03:33.000
For example, you can't really search by organization, which would be interesting.

35
0:03:33.000 --> 0:03:38.000
I mean it's about the relationship between government and business in follow the money terms.

36
0:03:38.000 --> 0:03:43.000
So why is there no option to search for organizations that I'm interested in?

37
0:03:43.000 --> 0:03:49.000
I can only really do a full text search over these huge XML files, which are really complex.

38
0:03:49.000 --> 0:03:53.000
And I can do some other stuff, but there's no type of tolerance, for example.

39
0:03:53.000 --> 0:03:58.000
None of the really nice search features that we've been used to.

40
0:03:58.000 --> 0:04:05.000
And most importantly, there's no ability at all to readily visualize the results that I get.

41
0:04:05.000 --> 0:04:12.000
Like if I type something in here in a search mask, I get back a list of HTML,

42
0:04:12.000 --> 0:04:18.000
basically just an HTML list of notices that I need to understand what's a notice

43
0:04:18.000 --> 0:04:20.000
and what are the different types of notices that I'm interested in.

44
0:04:20.000 --> 0:04:23.000
So it's really hard.

45
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:28.000
It makes a test right now because accessibility is really bad with this data.

46
0:04:28.000 --> 0:04:30.000
So why is the data needed?

47
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:34.000
In the past, there have been a number of attempts to look at this data

48
0:04:34.000 --> 0:04:39.000
and transform it into a more manageable or readily analyzable format.

49
0:04:39.000 --> 0:04:46.000
And we weren't really able to identify a single, freely available solution

50
0:04:46.000 --> 0:04:51.000
that was published under a free software license that allows you to explore this data

51
0:04:51.000 --> 0:04:55.000
even if you don't have domain expertise or data science expertise.

52
0:04:55.000 --> 0:05:01.000
And you kind of need both now to be able to make some sense of this data.

53
0:05:01.000 --> 0:05:03.000
And we thought this would be interesting.

54
0:05:03.000 --> 0:05:06.000
So why isn't this more readily available?

55
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:11.000
So we applied to last year's EU data form with this idea, basically,

56
0:05:11.000 --> 0:05:13.000
to make this data more accessible.

57
0:05:13.000 --> 0:05:15.000
And this is what we told them.

58
0:05:15.000 --> 0:05:20.000
So we have, as any type of, let's say we have a public servant

59
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:26.000
who finds out who buys what from within Germany or within their state,

60
0:05:26.000 --> 0:05:29.000
who buys from Microsoft, Georgia,

61
0:05:29.000 --> 0:05:35.000
and how much they spend on free software from this company.

62
0:05:35.000 --> 0:05:40.000
And yes, maybe make the case of how much they can save if they use free software.

63
0:05:40.000 --> 0:05:45.000
Or let's say you're a journalist who wants to investigate

64
0:05:45.000 --> 0:05:50.000
some of the recent purchases made by a foreign authority.

65
0:05:50.000 --> 0:05:53.000
You could do that now with a tap interface,

66
0:05:53.000 --> 0:05:55.000
but very, very difficult.

67
0:05:55.000 --> 0:05:58.000
And you can jump a lot of hurdles to get there.

68
0:05:58.000 --> 0:06:03.000
So we want to take it as to be an application that you use,

69
0:06:03.000 --> 0:06:07.000
which lowers the barrier of entry to analyze.

70
0:06:07.000 --> 0:06:13.000
So we thought let's present the publications of this concept

71
0:06:13.000 --> 0:06:17.000
with free software, and it's giving it very simple.

72
0:06:17.000 --> 0:06:21.000
So we built something roughly with this architecture.

73
0:06:21.000 --> 0:06:23.000
So you have this XML file,

74
0:06:23.000 --> 0:06:28.000
and this was very quickly built just for this data.

75
0:06:28.000 --> 0:06:30.000
So I'll go through it quickly.

76
0:06:30.000 --> 0:06:32.000
So we had this XML file.

77
0:06:32.000 --> 0:06:34.000
I transformed it to JSON for whatever reason,

78
0:06:34.000 --> 0:06:36.000
which was a very bad idea.

79
0:06:36.000 --> 0:06:40.000
And then I parsed it in Python and put it in some ad hoc schema in Postgres.

80
0:06:40.000 --> 0:06:45.000
And then I used the Neo4j ETL tool to put it to a Neo4j database.

81
0:06:45.000 --> 0:06:47.000
The data I was interested in was relational data

82
0:06:47.000 --> 0:06:52.000
between the chosen relationship between business and government.

83
0:06:52.000 --> 0:06:55.000
And then I used NeoDash to visualize that.

84
0:06:55.000 --> 0:07:00.000
And that actually already gave people a few days

85
0:07:00.000 --> 0:07:06.000
a chance to see what might be possible if you open up this data.

86
0:07:06.000 --> 0:07:12.000
So I'll show you a little demo of how that looked.

87
0:07:12.000 --> 0:07:14.000
So basically this is just an overview.

88
0:07:14.000 --> 0:07:17.000
I parsed the data for roughly three years, or two and a half years.

89
0:07:17.000 --> 0:07:21.000
This shows you the activity per country.

90
0:07:21.000 --> 0:07:23.000
This is just some general overviews,

91
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:26.000
like roughly a million vendors.

92
0:07:26.000 --> 0:07:30.000
And then it's not optimized yet.

93
0:07:30.000 --> 0:07:33.000
You get a, basically you search for Microsoft Germany,

94
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:35.000
and then you have this graph.

95
0:07:35.000 --> 0:07:38.000
You have a geographical distribution of commercial activity

96
0:07:38.000 --> 0:07:41.000
that's related to Microsoft.

97
0:07:41.000 --> 0:07:44.000
And you get this nice graph of relationships

98
0:07:44.000 --> 0:07:50.000
between Microsoft Germany here in the center as an entity.

99
0:07:50.000 --> 0:07:53.000
And then the yellow or red ones are tenders.

100
0:07:53.000 --> 0:07:59.000
So here they sold something to some institution of German government,

101
0:07:59.000 --> 0:08:01.000
in this case here.

102
0:08:01.000 --> 0:08:04.000
Mostly because Microsoft, Deutschland, mostly sells to the German government.

103
0:08:04.000 --> 0:08:09.000
And the red ones are tenders above one million euro.

104
0:08:09.000 --> 0:08:14.000
And that gave you a very quick overview

105
0:08:14.000 --> 0:08:17.000
of the commercial activity and the relationship

106
0:08:17.000 --> 0:08:20.000
between government entities and business entities.

107
0:08:20.000 --> 0:08:27.000
I do the same with, you get more information here.

108
0:08:27.000 --> 0:08:30.000
You can actually go to the Deutsch website to see the notice

109
0:08:30.000 --> 0:08:34.000
that was analyzed.

110
0:08:34.000 --> 0:08:35.000
Yeah.

111
0:08:35.000 --> 0:08:37.000
A short question.

112
0:08:37.000 --> 0:08:39.000
You search now for Microsoft,

113
0:08:39.000 --> 0:08:42.000
but usually they work with might be server providers

114
0:08:42.000 --> 0:08:46.000
that help to their direct relationship.

115
0:08:46.000 --> 0:08:49.000
Is that something you've been there?

116
0:08:49.000 --> 0:08:50.000
Yeah.

117
0:08:50.000 --> 0:08:53.000
Can we go back to the challenges that we face

118
0:08:53.000 --> 0:08:56.000
that you can all help us overcome?

119
0:08:56.000 --> 0:08:58.000
But that's certainly one.

120
0:08:58.000 --> 0:09:02.000
So again, I do the same with the Polish order authority.

121
0:09:02.000 --> 0:09:06.000
Here's more like who does an entity buy from

122
0:09:06.000 --> 0:09:08.000
over the past two and a half years.

123
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:13.000
You can see what kind of like fence and weapon and ammunition stuff they bought.

124
0:09:13.000 --> 0:09:17.000
I mean, I'll have to get through this because,

125
0:09:17.000 --> 0:09:20.000
yeah, this is actually another problem that I'll talk about

126
0:09:20.000 --> 0:09:22.000
towards the end of the talk.

127
0:09:22.000 --> 0:09:24.000
It's deduplication.

128
0:09:24.000 --> 0:09:26.000
So in TAD data, as it's published in these external files,

129
0:09:26.000 --> 0:09:29.000
there's no deduplication of entities at all.

130
0:09:29.000 --> 0:09:31.000
So you can have Microsoft, Deutschland, DMP,

131
0:09:31.000 --> 0:09:34.000
Microsoft Deutschland, just Microsoft, whatever that is.

132
0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:37.000
And like you can see here, Microsoft Ireland,

133
0:09:37.000 --> 0:09:39.000
like there's all these different.

134
0:09:39.000 --> 0:09:42.000
So I did some very naive deduplication attempt.

135
0:09:42.000 --> 0:09:45.000
I also put that data in the Neo4j graph,

136
0:09:45.000 --> 0:09:48.000
but there's much more to be done on that front.

137
0:09:48.000 --> 0:09:51.000
And it's very interesting problem, I think.

138
0:09:51.000 --> 0:09:55.000
Also because you need to think about it from a policy side as well.

139
0:09:55.000 --> 0:10:00.000
Like is Microsoft Deutschland a different entity from Microsoft Ireland?

140
0:10:00.000 --> 0:10:03.000
And if yes, what does that mean for my data analysis?

141
0:10:03.000 --> 0:10:05.000
Should I analyze them together?

142
0:10:05.000 --> 0:10:07.000
Because they're really operating as one entity.

143
0:10:07.000 --> 0:10:12.000
So there are interesting questions connected to this that are not only technical.

144
0:10:12.000 --> 0:10:16.000
So let's go back to my...

145
0:10:16.000 --> 0:10:29.000
So that was obviously limited in scope because it was really at all.

146
0:10:29.000 --> 0:10:34.000
It was pretty main and there were lots of problems with how I find this data for this implementation.

147
0:10:34.000 --> 0:10:39.000
So now we're at the stage where there's actually a lot of interest in this,

148
0:10:39.000 --> 0:10:41.000
in the MSAP doing this.

149
0:10:41.000 --> 0:10:48.000
I heard from a lot of people that they would be interested in analyzing this data

150
0:10:48.000 --> 0:10:51.000
and being able to explore this data.

151
0:10:51.000 --> 0:10:56.000
So what's next and what's already implemented?

152
0:10:56.000 --> 0:11:00.000
So there's the open contracting data standard,

153
0:11:00.000 --> 0:11:06.000
which is something that actually came after TET was first published.

154
0:11:06.000 --> 0:11:09.000
So I told you already TET was first published in 2015.

155
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:13.000
I think the OCPS started being developed around 2018, 2019, something like that.

156
0:11:13.000 --> 0:11:19.000
And if you now build any kind of public procurement platform,

157
0:11:19.000 --> 0:11:23.000
you use this data standard because it's just a very nice way for people

158
0:11:23.000 --> 0:11:29.000
to put a lot of thought into how can we display this entire process of public procurement?

159
0:11:29.000 --> 0:11:32.000
How can we put this neatly into a data structure?

160
0:11:32.000 --> 0:11:38.000
And so now we're building detectives with this data structure at its core.

161
0:11:38.000 --> 0:11:45.000
And the first task will be to parse this TET XML jungle

162
0:11:45.000 --> 0:11:51.000
into this nicely specified OCPS.

163
0:11:51.000 --> 0:11:57.000
So I built a relational database that roughly captures OCPS.

164
0:11:57.000 --> 0:12:00.000
You see a lot of JSON-B in the process there,

165
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:04.000
because some things I didn't, there were many to many or many to one,

166
0:12:04.000 --> 0:12:09.000
but JSON-B for now makes it much easier.

167
0:12:09.000 --> 0:12:14.000
Otherwise this table would not have been presented to.

168
0:12:14.000 --> 0:12:17.000
And now, I mean, this is the graph system step-through after all.

169
0:12:17.000 --> 0:12:20.000
The next question, because I think analyzing this data,

170
0:12:20.000 --> 0:12:24.000
analyzing public procurement data, analyzing these relationships between business

171
0:12:24.000 --> 0:12:32.000
and government, this really lends itself to being capsulated in a graph database.

172
0:12:32.000 --> 0:12:36.000
So this is really the core of OCPS that's interesting,

173
0:12:36.000 --> 0:12:43.000
and that would be interesting to model in a graph database like Neo4j.

174
0:12:43.000 --> 0:12:47.000
You have these tender, like a tender is basically a company says,

175
0:12:47.000 --> 0:12:52.000
like we're talking about, we go and the public entity says,

176
0:12:52.000 --> 0:12:55.000
we want to buy X or Y amount.

177
0:12:55.000 --> 0:12:59.000
And then an organization, another organization can apply for that.

178
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:03.000
They're usually like something commercial.

179
0:13:03.000 --> 0:13:11.000
They say, look, we can furnish the standard, like we apply for the standard.

180
0:13:11.000 --> 0:13:14.000
And that's interesting data in and of itself,

181
0:13:14.000 --> 0:13:17.000
who applies for which tenders and which regions and stuff like that.

182
0:13:17.000 --> 0:13:18.000
And then there's awards.

183
0:13:18.000 --> 0:13:23.000
That's basically who gets the contract on the wall.

184
0:13:23.000 --> 0:13:27.000
And so that would be a very simple place to start with, with a graph database,

185
0:13:27.000 --> 0:13:32.000
to just have this, have all the tech data going back from F15,

186
0:13:32.000 --> 0:13:37.000
parse it into OCPS, and then take this subset of what's really central

187
0:13:37.000 --> 0:13:42.000
and put it into a graph database and really start exploring this visually.

188
0:13:42.000 --> 0:13:46.000
And that's what we want to do.

189
0:13:46.000 --> 0:13:49.000
And part of it is already done.

190
0:13:49.000 --> 0:13:55.000
So I'm currently working, we are currently working on parsing this data,

191
0:13:55.000 --> 0:13:59.000
this XML, use XML library for that.

192
0:13:59.000 --> 0:14:00.000
It's really nice.

193
0:14:00.000 --> 0:14:05.000
And I punch this into a relational database.

194
0:14:05.000 --> 0:14:10.000
And I specify the OCPS data schema with SQL model,

195
0:14:10.000 --> 0:14:13.000
which is really cool for the library.

196
0:14:13.000 --> 0:14:17.000
Basically gives you high-dentic models and SQL LBB models in the one entity.

197
0:14:17.000 --> 0:14:19.000
It's really cool.

198
0:14:19.000 --> 0:14:21.000
It's really nice to work with.

199
0:14:21.000 --> 0:14:26.000
And then I want to create CSV export to be then able to input that data

200
0:14:26.000 --> 0:14:32.000
and Neo4j, put it back fast if I'm scaffolding around that,

201
0:14:32.000 --> 0:14:36.000
and then also build some UI, which we are currently researching,

202
0:14:36.000 --> 0:14:41.000
which framework to use, and I'm also here to find out which one would be the coolest one.

203
0:14:41.000 --> 0:14:46.000
So I'll stay here, because I think there will be some problems in the JST.

204
0:14:46.000 --> 0:14:49.000
Yeah, but there's also Reactforce Graph, and yeah,

205
0:14:49.000 --> 0:14:53.000
it's really like a nice UI that's specifically geared towards that use space

206
0:14:53.000 --> 0:14:57.000
of analyzing public procurement data.

207
0:14:57.000 --> 0:15:01.000
And yeah, then, had the back end backed by these two,

208
0:15:01.000 --> 0:15:04.000
like the relational database and the Neo4j database,

209
0:15:04.000 --> 0:15:12.000
and then choose depending on the query which data source you actually use.

210
0:15:12.000 --> 0:15:15.000
I'll go through the rest really quickly,

211
0:15:15.000 --> 0:15:19.000
and then I'll go through the rest of the process.

212
0:15:19.000 --> 0:15:23.000
If you want to get unboarded, the documentation is still up around the edges.

213
0:15:23.000 --> 0:15:29.000
I'll do my best in the next days and weeks to really make the project approachable to new developers.

214
0:15:29.000 --> 0:15:37.000
What we find is interesting is I want to work with me and the MSP on this.

215
0:15:37.000 --> 0:15:44.000
So some key characteristics that we want to really put a focus on with Detective

216
0:15:44.000 --> 0:15:52.000
is reuse compliant, that means like every file has the license header and copyright header,

217
0:15:52.000 --> 0:15:56.000
so that it can really be easily reused.

218
0:15:56.000 --> 0:16:01.000
And we want to make it for the people, so like a lot of my work in the next weeks

219
0:16:01.000 --> 0:16:07.000
will also include speaking to people who analyze public procurement data

220
0:16:07.000 --> 0:16:10.000
and ask them what kind of queries they would,

221
0:16:10.000 --> 0:16:14.000
what kind of questions they would like to ask, because that's really important for the design

222
0:16:14.000 --> 0:16:19.000
of the system that you ask people that are later going to use it.

223
0:16:19.000 --> 0:16:21.000
How could this be helpful?

224
0:16:21.000 --> 0:16:25.000
We have done some of that, but we will do way more of that,

225
0:16:25.000 --> 0:16:30.000
especially now because we start building the UI.

226
0:16:30.000 --> 0:16:34.000
And we want it to be interoperable, so everything that the Detective uses,

227
0:16:34.000 --> 0:16:42.000
every data that it uses will be also published under RBCC 5.0 license

228
0:16:42.000 --> 0:16:47.000
and there will be open API interface, there will be publicly available,

229
0:16:47.000 --> 0:16:53.000
obviously some limits get too crazy, but we will think about that when the problem arrives.

230
0:16:53.000 --> 0:16:56.000
And also we fundamentally believe that link data is more interesting,

231
0:16:56.000 --> 0:16:59.000
because once you have this data in the OCS format,

232
0:16:59.000 --> 0:17:02.000
you can start making it with other data sources based on

233
0:17:02.000 --> 0:17:07.000
if you have an undergrad database, you can start linking it with other data sources.

234
0:17:07.000 --> 0:17:11.000
Things that come to mind would be open corporate data

235
0:17:11.000 --> 0:17:15.000
where you can really enrich the data that you have in organizations

236
0:17:15.000 --> 0:17:19.000
with data that's in this public database of corporate entities.

237
0:17:19.000 --> 0:17:24.000
Open sanctions would then allow you to flag people or companies or entities

238
0:17:24.000 --> 0:17:29.000
that are on some sanction list and stuff like the offshore leaks database

239
0:17:29.000 --> 0:17:32.000
would allow you to highlight things to offshore companies and stuff like that.

240
0:17:32.000 --> 0:17:36.000
That's a basis for your analysis.

241
0:17:36.000 --> 0:17:40.000
So this would be a future possibility that I'm really excited about,

242
0:17:40.000 --> 0:17:45.000
but the first step is obviously to get this into a nice format

243
0:17:45.000 --> 0:17:49.000
and that's to think about extending.

244
0:17:49.000 --> 0:17:53.000
Some of the challenges is re-cleaning this step data,

245
0:17:53.000 --> 0:17:58.000
because some of it is quite old, like if you look at data that was published in 2015

246
0:17:58.000 --> 0:18:04.000
and there's a lot of typos in there and there's huge XML files

247
0:18:04.000 --> 0:18:07.000
that didn't currently do much validation of the forms

248
0:18:07.000 --> 0:18:11.000
that were used to take input this data.

249
0:18:11.000 --> 0:18:16.000
So in some places it's very messy.

250
0:18:16.000 --> 0:18:20.000
And OCS helps a lot actually with starting this data,

251
0:18:20.000 --> 0:18:23.000
because it's very well defined standard and there's a mapping concept

252
0:18:23.000 --> 0:18:27.000
of OCS that some people have published, so it's really cool.

253
0:18:27.000 --> 0:18:31.000
And then the next big problem that we would be dealt with

254
0:18:31.000 --> 0:18:36.000
is depuplication of problem.

255
0:18:36.000 --> 0:18:43.000
Which I already have online, and yes, we're very cool.

256
0:18:43.000 --> 0:18:48.000
If you have good ideas on that, I think that's really good.

257
0:18:48.000 --> 0:18:53.000
Because I think that's really central to take the theme helpful.

258
0:18:53.000 --> 0:18:58.000
So how can you get involved? All the code lives on our git instance.

259
0:18:58.000 --> 0:19:02.000
At the moment you can only really contribute your PR issues

260
0:19:02.000 --> 0:19:06.000
if you make an account and I'll get this free.

261
0:19:06.000 --> 0:19:10.000
It's just a couple of weeks, but that's fine.

262
0:19:10.000 --> 0:19:17.000
Nobody manages that and we'll think about mirroring on GitHub.

263
0:19:17.000 --> 0:19:22.000
But let's try this first. Maybe there's federation coming for the...

264
0:19:22.000 --> 0:19:26.000
for the git forges.dariat, as I understand.

265
0:19:26.000 --> 0:19:29.000
There's also websites with the documentation

266
0:19:29.000 --> 0:19:31.000
and then you can also write an e-colon to...

267
0:19:31.000 --> 0:19:34.000
this will always reach the retailers.

268
0:19:34.000 --> 0:19:37.000
So, yeah, I'm looking forward to your questions.

269
0:19:37.000 --> 0:19:39.000
Thank you very much.

270
0:19:39.000 --> 0:19:45.000
APPLAUSE

271
0:19:48.000 --> 0:19:50.000
That's it.

272
0:19:50.000 --> 0:19:56.000
Regarding funding, did you try to icon-text the official European institution

273
0:19:56.000 --> 0:19:59.000
so that you can have funding for this UI

274
0:19:59.000 --> 0:20:03.000
and that it becomes like the default UI for that in Europe?

275
0:20:03.000 --> 0:20:05.000
So I know that...

276
0:20:05.000 --> 0:20:09.000
So the question was whether we asked the publications of this

277
0:20:09.000 --> 0:20:12.000
or funding for this.

278
0:20:12.000 --> 0:20:15.000
Not specifically yet.

279
0:20:15.000 --> 0:20:18.000
I know that they are working themselves on a huge reform

280
0:20:18.000 --> 0:20:20.000
of the entire ecosystem.

281
0:20:20.000 --> 0:20:23.000
So they do this, what they call e-forms now,

282
0:20:23.000 --> 0:20:28.000
which is supposed to substitute what used to be TED.

283
0:20:28.000 --> 0:20:30.000
But e-forms still isn't OSPS.

284
0:20:30.000 --> 0:20:34.000
There's discussions around that that I fully understand all the time.

285
0:20:34.000 --> 0:20:37.000
And they're also rebuilding the TED website.

286
0:20:37.000 --> 0:20:39.000
We should get the complex with them.

287
0:20:39.000 --> 0:20:43.000
I have the complex because we won this data bomb

288
0:20:43.000 --> 0:20:46.000
and we have the... I have taken some context there.

289
0:20:46.000 --> 0:20:48.000
We should make use of it.

290
0:20:48.000 --> 0:21:16.000
And this will happen.

291
0:21:16.000 --> 0:21:20.000
It will be all in OSPS format.

292
0:21:20.000 --> 0:21:24.000
Honestly, I don't think anything else makes sense.

293
0:21:24.000 --> 0:21:27.000
So it's just data that...

294
0:21:27.000 --> 0:21:30.000
We will republish this OSPS.

295
0:21:30.000 --> 0:21:34.000
There's some place like Open Tender, which was a component project

296
0:21:34.000 --> 0:21:39.000
which also does this republishing of the data that is OSPS.

297
0:21:39.000 --> 0:21:44.000
But it's not consistent in how it's regularly uploaded.

298
0:21:44.000 --> 0:21:47.000
It's not a complex database.

299
0:21:47.000 --> 0:21:53.000
It doesn't seem very active in any time.

300
0:21:53.000 --> 0:21:55.000
I have a question.

301
0:21:55.000 --> 0:21:58.000
When you look at these headers and the companies involved,

302
0:21:58.000 --> 0:22:01.000
are you also able to extract what the action tender is about?

303
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:03.000
So is there an analyzed structure?

304
0:22:03.000 --> 0:22:06.000
This is about, I don't know, classroom, furniture,

305
0:22:06.000 --> 0:22:08.000
and this is about military equipment.

306
0:22:08.000 --> 0:22:11.000
So that you can correlate, or by item,

307
0:22:11.000 --> 0:22:15.000
or by contract project?

308
0:22:15.000 --> 0:22:16.000
Yes.

309
0:22:16.000 --> 0:22:19.000
Should I repeat the question?

310
0:22:19.000 --> 0:22:21.000
So the question was whether there's also data about

311
0:22:21.000 --> 0:22:25.000
what is being procured and details about what's being procured

312
0:22:25.000 --> 0:22:27.000
by public institutions.

313
0:22:27.000 --> 0:22:28.000
And the answer is yes.

314
0:22:28.000 --> 0:22:31.000
There's usually a title that's fairly descriptive.

315
0:22:31.000 --> 0:22:37.000
And a description, sometimes in English, sometimes in other words.

316
0:22:37.000 --> 0:22:42.000
And then there's CPD codes, which is a common procurement vocabulary

317
0:22:42.000 --> 0:22:48.000
that specifies what kind of category this procurement is in.

318
0:22:48.000 --> 0:22:52.000
But some stuff is excluded by this legislation.

319
0:22:52.000 --> 0:22:57.000
For example, like military personnel is not published in this data.

320
0:22:57.000 --> 0:23:01.000
Sorry, can't talk about open procurement in the context yet

321
0:23:01.000 --> 0:23:05.000
because there's still lots of sensitive data

322
0:23:05.000 --> 0:23:08.000
that's not being included in that.

323
0:23:08.000 --> 0:23:10.000
Do you plan to host it publicly?

324
0:23:10.000 --> 0:23:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

325
0:23:11.000 --> 0:23:13.000
Do we plan to host it publicly?

326
0:23:13.000 --> 0:23:16.000
Yes, yes, absolutely.

327
0:23:16.000 --> 0:23:19.000
It's just at the moment the API is down because I re-vector it.

328
0:23:19.000 --> 0:23:20.000
So many things.

329
0:23:20.000 --> 0:23:23.000
But it will be.

330
0:23:23.000 --> 0:23:25.000
It will be after again.

331
0:23:25.000 --> 0:23:27.000
Yeah, of course it will be publicly available,

332
0:23:27.000 --> 0:23:30.000
but if everything crashes because there's so much interest in it,

333
0:23:30.000 --> 0:23:33.000
then we'll have to think about limiting it somehow.

334
0:23:33.000 --> 0:23:35.000
But there's a system.

335
0:23:35.000 --> 0:23:38.000
Exactly, yeah.

336
0:23:38.000 --> 0:23:44.000
So we'll see, you know, if there's really that much interest.

337
0:23:44.000 --> 0:23:45.000
I have a question.

338
0:23:45.000 --> 0:23:48.000
What have been the biggest challenges you've had

339
0:23:48.000 --> 0:23:52.000
when you did a new university?

340
0:23:52.000 --> 0:23:58.000
So what was the biggest challenge in cleaning the data?

341
0:23:58.000 --> 0:24:05.000
So I would say one is just finding if there is an English translation available,

342
0:24:05.000 --> 0:24:09.000
finding that for the specific, because we really lay out in this XML file

343
0:24:09.000 --> 0:24:14.000
that we can translate around and where is, if a translation exists,

344
0:24:14.000 --> 0:24:16.000
like where is it in XML?

345
0:24:16.000 --> 0:24:21.000
Like what other, like what does it apply to?

346
0:24:21.000 --> 0:24:29.000
Another one was languages that I didn't know the alphabet of,

347
0:24:29.000 --> 0:24:33.000
the hard to parse, and yeah, that just in general,

348
0:24:33.000 --> 0:24:37.000
that company names that they didn't have for a long time,

349
0:24:37.000 --> 0:24:42.000
I mean any validation on what you could put in there,

350
0:24:42.000 --> 0:24:44.000
which makes it really hard.

351
0:24:44.000 --> 0:24:47.000
It would have been very easy to implement upstream,

352
0:24:47.000 --> 0:24:54.000
but now it's because you found space.

353
0:24:54.000 --> 0:25:01.000
Thank you.

354
0:25:01.000 --> 0:25:19.000
.
