1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.240
All good. I don't know if this is working, but it's green.

2
0:00:07.240 --> 0:00:13.320
Ah, look at you. Crikey. Thank you for coming. Look at this. Excitable people. Collaboration.

3
0:00:13.320 --> 0:00:20.280
Well, so here we are with Collabora. I hope this is what you want to hear. One of my concerns

4
0:00:20.280 --> 0:00:24.600
is that I've given similar talks in the past. So maybe we have lots of time for questions

5
0:00:24.600 --> 0:00:33.280
at the end. So I tried to do some different things this time. So one thing that we're

6
0:00:33.280 --> 0:00:38.080
really eager to do is to get Collabora Online reused in lots of different places. And lots

7
0:00:38.080 --> 0:00:42.720
of innovation going on out there. And lots of people have great ideas of how to use documents

8
0:00:42.720 --> 0:00:47.840
and make them look better on the web. And we would love to integrate with you to do

9
0:00:47.840 --> 0:00:56.080
that. So one of the things that we are really useful for is converting documents to different

10
0:00:56.080 --> 0:01:03.400
formats, which seems like an easy thing to do. But it's really tough. And to wrap that

11
0:01:03.400 --> 0:01:08.280
up nicely for you, we have this beautiful REST endpoint. And it looks so simple. You

12
0:01:08.280 --> 0:01:12.880
just do the skill command. Brilliant. And you ignore certificates, so you should remove

13
0:01:12.880 --> 0:01:18.720
that in deployment. And out of it, you get, well, what do you get? You get your text file

14
0:01:18.720 --> 0:01:25.720
turned into a Doc X. That's an easy one. But imagine you wanted to convert a PDF or a PPTX

15
0:01:25.720 --> 0:01:33.400
into a PDF. Or a very common request is converting PPTX into animated SVG. So we can do that

16
0:01:33.400 --> 0:01:37.480
very nicely. We can produce XHTML out of it. You can run in your browser. That's actually

17
0:01:37.480 --> 0:01:41.880
how Collabora Online does its presentation thing. So you can get animations and presentations.

18
0:01:41.880 --> 0:01:48.720
You can understand the structure of your arbitrarily horrible, say, binary PowerPoint file. And

19
0:01:48.720 --> 0:01:52.520
you can dump that into something you can parse and read and interpret and mash up and do

20
0:01:52.520 --> 0:01:57.480
cool stuff with. And the good news about that is that, well, see, people do this already

21
0:01:57.480 --> 0:02:04.040
in lots of horrible ways. So I will pick on someone. I don't know. Is there any, who do

22
0:02:04.040 --> 0:02:10.360
we have in the room? OK, let me think. What integration do I particularly like? So there

23
0:02:10.360 --> 0:02:14.960
is an unnamed open source project. And when it tries to convert its files to show them

24
0:02:14.960 --> 0:02:21.800
in its jitsy-like, remarkably jitsy-like video, no, not jitsy. I forget. One of these video

25
0:02:21.800 --> 0:02:26.280
conferencing systems, big blue button, let's call it. It essentially has a shell script.

26
0:02:26.280 --> 0:02:32.360
And all of the good, beautiful software architecture stops at the point you want to convert a document.

27
0:02:32.360 --> 0:02:36.560
And it launches a shell script which starts a Docker image, which then launches another

28
0:02:36.560 --> 0:02:40.680
shell script in the Docker image that copies a file into it with some horrible command

29
0:02:40.680 --> 0:02:45.560
that then converts it via another shell script that launches an office suite that sits and

30
0:02:45.560 --> 0:02:52.440
talks to a RPC. And then it's just absolute horror. And if any of this hangs or dies or

31
0:02:52.440 --> 0:02:57.640
crashes or burns or uses more CPU or finds that one document that has a real problem,

32
0:02:57.640 --> 0:03:02.680
you're just doomed. You have to write all of this lifecycle management nightmare. And

33
0:03:02.680 --> 0:03:07.120
the good news is, with our beautiful API, you don't need to care about any of that. Deploy

34
0:03:07.120 --> 0:03:10.880
the Docker image. Job done. If it's too big, we'll time out. If it's too horrible, we'll

35
0:03:10.880 --> 0:03:15.920
tell you. And it's all done for you. So that's kind of good if you want the whole document.

36
0:03:15.920 --> 0:03:20.800
Often, though, people have enterprise files they can share. They want to see their documents.

37
0:03:20.800 --> 0:03:26.160
You know, they're fed up of seeing an icon. They want to see what's inside it. So again,

38
0:03:26.160 --> 0:03:30.840
we can convert your document to an easy thumbnail, very trivially. Nice big image. You can shrink

39
0:03:30.840 --> 0:03:36.800
it down to whatever size you like. And that's pretty good. So we're really eager that people

40
0:03:36.800 --> 0:03:41.320
use it everywhere. And so we've written most of the work for you already. So you can use

41
0:03:41.320 --> 0:03:46.160
it. I think it's a patchy license. I'm a really liberal, you know. I'm more of a copy left

42
0:03:46.160 --> 0:03:50.600
guy. But at least I understand. Some other people aren't. So, you know, in the language

43
0:03:50.600 --> 0:03:56.240
of choice, we probably missed our Ruby. I'm going to get in trouble with, you know, Neil

44
0:03:56.240 --> 0:04:01.160
later. But there you go. And we've done a whole lot of features recently. So one of

45
0:04:01.160 --> 0:04:06.160
them I was really surprised and encouraged. I was talking to someone from a European office

46
0:04:06.160 --> 0:04:10.920
full of lawyers earlier. And you wouldn't believe it, but they really love citations.

47
0:04:10.920 --> 0:04:15.240
That's, you know, they're all court cases, of course. I always think academic citations.

48
0:04:15.240 --> 0:04:20.560
But, you know, referring to other legal cases, it's this massive, world wide web of knowledge

49
0:04:20.560 --> 0:04:24.640
about what's fair, you know. And anyway, so we've done lots of things with Zotero. So

50
0:04:24.640 --> 0:04:28.440
one of the things that you can do if you have a collaborative online integration now is

51
0:04:28.440 --> 0:04:35.720
to just to push, you know, we added all this citation stuff in the tool bar here. And NextCloud

52
0:04:35.720 --> 0:04:39.480
implemented this. And all you need to do is provide a box somewhere that you can set this

53
0:04:39.480 --> 0:04:46.480
API key. So Zotero have a very nice REST API. And then we plug into that and you send us

54
0:04:46.480 --> 0:04:52.320
this, we have this user private info. So you have a user info which has things like avatars

55
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:56.320
and extended information about users that we send to everyone in the UI. We thought it

56
0:04:56.320 --> 0:05:01.800
was best not to send your private key to everyone. So we added this extra tag, user private info.

57
0:05:01.800 --> 0:05:06.560
And so when you connect to collaborative online and embed it in your iFrame, you need three

58
0:05:06.560 --> 0:05:12.920
methods. Get, so we can get the file and show it and render it. And then a post so we can

59
0:05:12.920 --> 0:05:16.660
send it back again when we've edited it. So that's the save. And then there's a check

60
0:05:16.660 --> 0:05:21.400
file info. And that basically tells us about you. So who is this person? You know, we've

61
0:05:21.400 --> 0:05:27.880
got a path thing, a URL for the document. And we've got a opaque identification password

62
0:05:27.880 --> 0:05:32.280
to token. But what's their name? Tell me their name. Tell me their, you know, what they look

63
0:05:32.280 --> 0:05:36.480
like, their avatar and this sort of thing. And so you just send this back there and bingo.

64
0:05:36.480 --> 0:05:41.880
Suddenly you have beautiful integration with all of your citation libraries. You don't

65
0:05:41.880 --> 0:05:47.280
need to run a Java wrap on the side and then talk. It just works really nicely. And updates

66
0:05:47.280 --> 0:05:53.080
all of your citations beautifully with a familiar interface. So that's kind of nice. That's a

67
0:05:53.080 --> 0:05:58.720
way of integrating sort of two things together through a very, very simple REST API into

68
0:05:58.720 --> 0:06:06.200
a nice UI. Yeah. So language tool is something else I love. I don't know if Daniel, Daniel's,

69
0:06:06.200 --> 0:06:11.560
he's probably a rich man. Grammarly, you know, has set a price point for, does anyone get

70
0:06:11.560 --> 0:06:16.880
Grammarly adverts? Has anyone watched YouTube? Has been plagued by, yeah. So, you know, there

71
0:06:16.880 --> 0:06:20.360
are many ways to create value in the world. You know, one of them is, of course, to create

72
0:06:20.360 --> 0:06:25.160
value. The other is to tell people you've created value. And, you know, and I think

73
0:06:25.160 --> 0:06:28.520
often as engineers we forget to tell people that we've created the value. You know, that's

74
0:06:28.520 --> 0:06:32.840
the problem. We do it all and then there's no marketing. I think Grammarly is probably

75
0:06:32.840 --> 0:06:38.720
the extreme example of, you know, marketing versus value. But anyway, so they can sell

76
0:06:38.720 --> 0:06:44.520
somehow for 30 bucks a month, 50 bucks a month, something like that, a subscription to their

77
0:06:44.520 --> 0:06:50.520
web grammar checker that sends all your information to someone else and sends it back, you know,

78
0:06:50.520 --> 0:06:55.360
with grammar checking, which is great. But because they've set the price point, there's

79
0:06:55.360 --> 0:06:59.360
a great company in Germany, I think based in Potsdam, that make, well, they already

80
0:06:59.360 --> 0:07:03.960
made an open source grammar checker. They've done the whole create the value bit. And so,

81
0:07:03.960 --> 0:07:07.680
but they now sell these lovely plug-ins to people and you can, you know, for much less

82
0:07:07.680 --> 0:07:12.520
money, get a better open source product and they have some of those nice AI things in

83
0:07:12.520 --> 0:07:18.200
there, you know. And AI is cool. Of course, for checking an ISBN is valid, probably not

84
0:07:18.200 --> 0:07:23.160
the best use of AI, I might argue. But on the other hand, sentence structure and human

85
0:07:23.160 --> 0:07:29.120
language, you know, that can be pretty cool. So, they're taking on Grammarly. And the nice

86
0:07:29.120 --> 0:07:31.960
thing about that, of course, is you can get a Docker image and you can deploy that in

87
0:07:31.960 --> 0:07:37.040
your Kubernetes, you know, whatever and connect it up to Collabora Online. So, all of your

88
0:07:37.040 --> 0:07:42.920
grammar checking stays in-house. So, you get the benefit of all of that goodness. And,

89
0:07:42.920 --> 0:07:46.920
you know, from a European free software company, I love it. And they're doing well and they're

90
0:07:46.920 --> 0:07:53.360
growing really nicely. So, nice to see that happen. Very easy to set up. And they even

91
0:07:53.360 --> 0:07:57.680
document the API nicely, which is kind of cool. So, you can see all of the, you know,

92
0:07:57.680 --> 0:08:03.840
number of features exposed in some of the JSON API they have for that URL. Again, very

93
0:08:03.840 --> 0:08:07.480
simple endpoints. You know, you just send your stuff to check and you get some answers

94
0:08:07.480 --> 0:08:12.080
back and we show it. And then, of course, you can configure that as you like. And they

95
0:08:12.080 --> 0:08:15.780
have a web service. I mean, another example of just sending text and getting text back

96
0:08:15.780 --> 0:08:23.040
is our DeepL integration. So, another easy thing there that's often useful for people.

97
0:08:23.040 --> 0:08:29.800
And yeah, it's a bit interesting this. So, obviously, they want to try and retain formatting,

98
0:08:29.800 --> 0:08:35.840
which is probably one of the big advantages over pasting it into your web browser. But

99
0:08:35.840 --> 0:08:38.680
you can buy an enterprise key for DeepL and use that, but you're not going to have it

100
0:08:38.680 --> 0:08:44.800
on premise, I guess. And then, trying to really get styles through HTML and map them back

101
0:08:44.800 --> 0:08:48.960
properly is more challenging than you might imagine. And we haven't done a very good job

102
0:08:48.960 --> 0:08:52.560
of it. So, if anyone wants to improve that, they're very welcome to, you know, to come

103
0:08:52.560 --> 0:08:57.280
and contribute. But I think this idea of, you know, ask the computer to improve my document

104
0:08:57.280 --> 0:09:02.360
and stuff, that interaction thing is there and working nicely. And there's lots of easy,

105
0:09:02.360 --> 0:09:09.480
low-hanging fruit if people want to help do cool stuff. So, one of the other things we

106
0:09:09.480 --> 0:09:14.640
try and do is we try and integrate outside the iframe. It's interesting. So, you create

107
0:09:14.640 --> 0:09:18.520
virtualization, for example. And almost all of the interesting thing about virtualization

108
0:09:18.520 --> 0:09:21.840
is the bit that isn't virtualized, you know, the bit where you can punch through the magic

109
0:09:21.840 --> 0:09:27.840
to not virtualize something and, you know, run the command inside the, anyway. So, similarly

110
0:09:27.840 --> 0:09:33.560
with us, you know, the integration is probably the most interesting bit around the edge.

111
0:09:33.560 --> 0:09:37.840
And it's much the best if you can do that. So, we've written a huge SDK so that you're,

112
0:09:37.840 --> 0:09:43.440
it's easy to do, which you can see online. And so, when you save as, it seems easy to

113
0:09:43.440 --> 0:09:46.560
save as, right? But I just explained to you how it works. You know, you do a get and you

114
0:09:46.560 --> 0:09:51.400
do a post and that's kind of easy for us. But if you want to save it as something else,

115
0:09:51.400 --> 0:09:56.280
it's more tricky. So, but yet people kind of want that if they're editing a document.

116
0:09:56.280 --> 0:10:00.600
They, you know, often people load a document and they continually save it as through its

117
0:10:00.600 --> 0:10:06.820
lifetime. So, the document you get actually started in 1995, you know? And it's been saved

118
0:10:06.820 --> 0:10:12.280
as ever since, you know, with a nice template and the WMF preview of Windows Metafire in

119
0:10:12.280 --> 0:10:16.200
the top right corner and all of that good stuff. And often we see the macros in it.

120
0:10:16.200 --> 0:10:21.040
I mean, we're analyzing government macros and we routinely see, like, the Windows, the

121
0:10:21.040 --> 0:10:27.400
Office 95 macro API had a compatibility when Office 97 arrived. And we're still seeing

122
0:10:27.400 --> 0:10:33.040
that in macros, you know, the word basic dot something thing. Just extraordinary. Anyway,

123
0:10:33.040 --> 0:10:37.880
save as is used. So, we should do that. I talk very quickly. Who has got lost? Does

124
0:10:37.880 --> 0:10:42.880
anyone, you know, know, you're, I'm sorry. Okay. So, we need a file picker. So, how are

125
0:10:42.880 --> 0:10:47.640
we going to get that? Well, I mentioned this check file info thing that tells us what you

126
0:10:47.640 --> 0:10:52.240
can cope with. And if you say, well, we can do insert remote image and we can do this

127
0:10:52.240 --> 0:10:56.600
right relative thing, then we'll send you a post message when you click save as. We

128
0:10:56.600 --> 0:11:00.920
send a post message outside the frame saying, hey, we want a graphic from somewhere, you

129
0:11:00.920 --> 0:11:06.520
know? And then you can do what you like. You pop up your nice file picker, come arbitrary

130
0:11:06.520 --> 0:11:11.560
image creator, ASCII art, you know, whatever thing. We don't care. And when you're done,

131
0:11:11.560 --> 0:11:15.360
send us this action insert graphic and just a URL to it and we'll put it in the document.

132
0:11:15.360 --> 0:11:22.120
That's kind of cool. Or we'll save as and reload and, you know, create a window for

133
0:11:22.120 --> 0:11:27.080
the new document. So, that's really useful and easy to do. And we're using, I think,

134
0:11:27.080 --> 0:11:31.520
the same hooks for our new export stuff. So, there's a whole lot of work in accessible

135
0:11:31.520 --> 0:11:36.600
PDF creation and PDF UA. And I mean, look at all these options. I mean, I hate options.

136
0:11:36.600 --> 0:11:41.480
But, you know, apparently you need all of these. So, we've added loads of them recently

137
0:11:41.480 --> 0:11:45.480
and you'll be pleased. And, of course, repub, it's very, very useful for accessibility.

138
0:11:45.480 --> 0:11:51.000
It's kind of an extended HTML dialect. So, you know, you can integrate easily and get

139
0:11:51.000 --> 0:11:56.760
all of this richness suddenly. One of our problems, of course, is that interoperability

140
0:11:56.760 --> 0:12:03.680
is really, really key in what we're doing. And people really care about that. And one

141
0:12:03.680 --> 0:12:09.960
of the challenges we have at the moment is our competition really is not great at interoperability.

142
0:12:09.960 --> 0:12:15.840
They're spoiled by interoperating with themselves a whole lot, which is easier. And so, when

143
0:12:15.840 --> 0:12:19.680
we save, I mean, we love ODF, right? But if you save in an ODF file, and hey, Neil, it's

144
0:12:19.680 --> 0:12:23.960
good to see you. And then you sort of download it somewhere else and give it to someone on

145
0:12:23.960 --> 0:12:28.280
a Windows machine, like it's not, they'll load it in Word. And it will completely mangle

146
0:12:28.280 --> 0:12:32.480
the document. You know, they even have a big list of the things they break. You know, there's

147
0:12:32.480 --> 0:12:36.760
a, I don't know if it's a thousand pages. It's a very large document that explains all the

148
0:12:36.760 --> 0:12:41.680
things they don't do, you know, change tracking. I mean, why would you want that? You know,

149
0:12:41.680 --> 0:12:45.000
what kind of features? Anyway, so, so lots of it is dropped on the floor, which would

150
0:12:45.000 --> 0:12:50.280
be fine, because obviously that product is awful. But it's sad to be blamed. You know,

151
0:12:50.280 --> 0:12:53.960
for someone, I mean, like, you know, the user perception is your product doesn't interoperate.

152
0:12:53.960 --> 0:12:58.040
You're like, are you sure it's me? You know, like, I don't know. So, of course, if you use,

153
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:02.640
if you use the doc X file format tragically, you know, we can interoperate better with

154
0:13:02.640 --> 0:13:06.040
the other, other world, which is a shame. But the good news is you shouldn't need to

155
0:13:06.040 --> 0:13:10.520
do that. You can use it all online in the browser and you can feel happy and relaxed,

156
0:13:10.520 --> 0:13:15.880
knowing it's an ODF format on your server and you have a full feature experience. But

157
0:13:15.880 --> 0:13:20.120
anyway, I was distracted. Remote font management. So, so that's all very good. But if you've

158
0:13:20.120 --> 0:13:23.840
ever written slides, what you'll notice is that, you know, that you change the wording

159
0:13:23.840 --> 0:13:28.840
of this, this line here until it just about fits in and doesn't wrap horribly, you know.

160
0:13:28.840 --> 0:13:33.480
And that's great. But of course, it's highly dependent on the font being used. And if you

161
0:13:33.480 --> 0:13:37.800
change the font, be it ever so slightly, you know, the text can grow and then everything

162
0:13:37.800 --> 0:13:42.400
looks awful. And of course, my slides look awful anyway, just because I'm a hacker. But

163
0:13:42.400 --> 0:13:46.680
other people have beautiful looking slides. And so anyway, we decided it was very useful

164
0:13:46.680 --> 0:13:52.480
to be able to configure fonts and that brings a whole load of interesting problems. But

165
0:13:52.480 --> 0:13:56.920
anyway, to make this even easier, we have remote configuration. So, so one of the things

166
0:13:56.920 --> 0:14:01.320
that's nice is to be able to deploy lots of images on Kubernetes and demand scale and

167
0:14:01.320 --> 0:14:06.400
more and more of these things. But it's a bit of a pain to configure them. And particularly

168
0:14:06.400 --> 0:14:10.280
for a large hoster or something, you know, you have customers that arrive quite regularly

169
0:14:10.280 --> 0:14:13.680
and add things and how you're going to deal with that and do you restart all the note?

170
0:14:13.680 --> 0:14:18.280
What do you do? So, we have this remote configuration endpoint now. So you can cut a whole load of

171
0:14:18.280 --> 0:14:22.680
your config out and collaborative line just go, hey, tell me my config. Oh, has it changed?

172
0:14:22.680 --> 0:14:28.200
And they pull it every minute or so and update a whole subset of those settings to make it

173
0:14:28.200 --> 0:14:32.080
easier. And one of those courses, the font, font setting. So it's easy to have then a

174
0:14:32.080 --> 0:14:36.120
path to font. So if you have a file sync and share thing and you can manage files, you

175
0:14:36.120 --> 0:14:40.800
know, just create a folder and drop loads of fonts in it and then we'll notice. And,

176
0:14:40.800 --> 0:14:46.240
you know, we just get this kind of JSON come out of that font endpoint, this thing we can

177
0:14:46.240 --> 0:14:51.120
figure in that tells us where they are and ideally some time stamps so we don't, you

178
0:14:51.120 --> 0:14:55.040
know, continually fetch them. And then we can just build a whole set of fonts. And in

179
0:14:55.040 --> 0:15:00.440
the background it's very funky because we have a fork hit. So you can't fork if you

180
0:15:00.440 --> 0:15:05.080
have threads and it's kind of useful to have threads. So we initialize LibreOffice in what

181
0:15:05.080 --> 0:15:09.800
we call the fork hit whose job is just to fork. And we pre-initialize everything, load

182
0:15:09.800 --> 0:15:15.080
our configuration and then we fork and copy on writes huge amounts of our static data.

183
0:15:15.080 --> 0:15:18.480
So if you started LibreOffice and thought, well, it took several seconds, what am I going

184
0:15:18.480 --> 0:15:22.600
to do online? Because that's the instant we fork within, you know, milliseconds and we

185
0:15:22.600 --> 0:15:26.760
have a document there ready to load and open. But the problem is it really needs all the

186
0:15:26.760 --> 0:15:30.280
fonts and we really don't want to handle all of those fonts to the child processes and

187
0:15:30.280 --> 0:15:35.120
we really control this very carefully from a security perspective. So anyway, after lots

188
0:15:35.120 --> 0:15:41.960
of work we now restart this, respawn, load files and pass them in and patch lots of infrastructure.

189
0:15:41.960 --> 0:15:45.400
I was actually just talking to Leonard and a few minutes ago about, he was telling me,

190
0:15:45.400 --> 0:15:48.120
oh, you've got to mount proc, you have to mount proc, you'll get screwed over, you have

191
0:15:48.120 --> 0:15:52.080
to mount devices. Otherwise, something will go wrong in your stack somewhere and we're

192
0:15:52.080 --> 0:15:56.600
like, yeah, well, you know, we tested that and we, you know, fixed and we patched around

193
0:15:56.600 --> 0:16:00.960
those things so that actually, you know, our jails have almost nothing in them. No proc,

194
0:16:00.960 --> 0:16:06.400
only two devices in slash dev, no shell, you know, they're pretty well locked down. So

195
0:16:06.400 --> 0:16:10.000
we like that. Oh, and then I've got a few minutes so I'll just show you a whole load

196
0:16:10.000 --> 0:16:15.240
of gratuitous features we've added just in case you like features. The users do, it turns

197
0:16:15.240 --> 0:16:22.400
out. So I'm a big hater of the blockchain but Devdow actually sponsored some of this

198
0:16:22.400 --> 0:16:28.000
work, so we like that. And the European Commission as well, so getting our columns into our spreadsheets,

199
0:16:28.000 --> 0:16:32.160
lots of them, has been happening and it's got rid of this very annoying dialogue that

200
0:16:32.160 --> 0:16:36.840
played lots of users for a long time, so that's really cool. Oh, and there's even the proper

201
0:16:36.840 --> 0:16:41.080
credit for the NGIA Dapsey. So the European Union Horizon Research Program is actually

202
0:16:41.080 --> 0:16:47.720
really cool and anyone who's not knows about it, if you have a good idea, the traditional

203
0:16:47.720 --> 0:16:51.920
way of getting funding from the European Union was that if you have a really good idea, you

204
0:16:51.920 --> 0:16:56.840
need to find 15 other people across 27 countries and then try and persuade them all that their

205
0:16:56.840 --> 0:17:01.120
idea is the same thing and then get someone to write the proposal and submit it and then

206
0:17:01.120 --> 0:17:07.640
you don't get it because it's all inconsistent. So the good thing about the NGIA Dapsey, the

207
0:17:07.640 --> 0:17:11.280
Horizon Research thing was that they said, hey, let's do something that's good for Europeans

208
0:17:11.280 --> 0:17:16.840
and so they would just give money to single vision of stuff and our vision was, well,

209
0:17:16.840 --> 0:17:20.440
let's fix interoperability. So we did a lot of that and they paid, which is awesome. Look

210
0:17:20.440 --> 0:17:26.280
at that. That's, yeah, you know, it just makes life so much easier, doesn't it? And probably

211
0:17:26.280 --> 0:17:31.440
good for Europe as well. So anyway, so form controls, creating lots of nice rich text

212
0:17:31.440 --> 0:17:36.680
folders, much better PDF export with creating real editable PDFs actually built into the

213
0:17:36.680 --> 0:17:41.400
product rather than having to layer things over the top afterwards, starting to theme

214
0:17:41.400 --> 0:17:45.840
colors so that you can select different bits of your document and change the theme and

215
0:17:45.840 --> 0:17:49.800
see how that impacts the whole document and we're doing lots of work here to extend that

216
0:17:49.800 --> 0:17:54.240
to writer and calc. Chart data tables, you wouldn't believe it, but these things at the

217
0:17:54.240 --> 0:17:58.760
bottom of charts are very popular in presentations. Some people like lines and other people like

218
0:17:58.760 --> 0:18:03.120
numbers and now you can do both in the same thing. It's a key interoperability thing.

219
0:18:03.120 --> 0:18:07.640
And then also other random interrupt things, you know, precisely anchoring your images

220
0:18:07.640 --> 0:18:13.760
and reflowing your text very nicely in the browser, improving our formula input bar,

221
0:18:13.760 --> 0:18:18.280
accessibility checker to try and find problems in your documents for the visually impaired,

222
0:18:18.280 --> 0:18:22.640
prettier dialogue functionality, so happening in the client side and lots of this is now

223
0:18:22.640 --> 0:18:29.040
JavaScript in the client side to make it more accessible and performance. We completely

224
0:18:29.040 --> 0:18:34.160
reworked the tile serving thing, so instead of sending new tiles when things change, we

225
0:18:34.160 --> 0:18:38.760
send very small deltas of them, so we find the pixels that change and then we Z-standard

226
0:18:38.760 --> 0:18:44.640
compress them, so we switch from big PNGs with like even headers in them and crazy stuff

227
0:18:44.640 --> 0:18:50.960
to much smaller Z-standard compressed things thanks to Facebook. I just need to thank Facebook

228
0:18:50.960 --> 0:18:57.400
for helping us all get digital sovereignty back, you know, that's important, you know.

229
0:18:57.400 --> 0:19:01.520
Good options, so you can put passwords on your files and various attributes, lots I've

230
0:19:01.520 --> 0:19:06.840
mentioned the PDF things, embedded video playbacks if you like, if you like that sort of thing.

231
0:19:06.840 --> 0:19:12.800
And the last silly idea I think in the few seconds I have left. So we've done a bit of

232
0:19:12.800 --> 0:19:16.800
a concept for running Collabor Online in the browser, so when you go through your tunnel

233
0:19:16.800 --> 0:19:22.560
and my hip is that tunnels get better connectivity, but you can then click a button and in theory

234
0:19:22.560 --> 0:19:26.760
run this thing offline. So we have a prototype now of Collabor Online, if you're interested

235
0:19:26.760 --> 0:19:30.720
in that, there will be talks in the LibreOffice track which is I suppose somewhere nearby,

236
0:19:30.720 --> 0:19:35.320
that then allows you to edit offline and there are a whole lot of interesting problems there.

237
0:19:35.320 --> 0:19:41.320
If you like wrestling with massive multi-gigabyte linkages and horrible nightmares, do get involved

238
0:19:41.320 --> 0:19:46.200
with that, but there's a little prototype there that will allow you to work on that and

239
0:19:46.200 --> 0:19:50.120
play with Wasm. So yeah, come hack with us, we have Hackfest. So there's a LibreOffice

240
0:19:50.120 --> 0:19:54.520
Hackfest if you're excited about LibreOffice and you should be. The cool kits are all using

241
0:19:54.520 --> 0:19:58.720
LibreOffice technology. Come to our Hackfest this Monday and Tuesday. We have a community

242
0:19:58.720 --> 0:20:03.360
dinner tonight with Pastor at the Business and Technology Incubator and there's a great

243
0:20:03.360 --> 0:20:07.480
link there. If you take a photo of it, you'll have it for later so you can come along. And

244
0:20:07.480 --> 0:20:13.240
beyond that, we're running our Hackfest in Clarecorage, Cambridge in March 28th and 29th,

245
0:20:13.240 --> 0:20:17.760
which is not only LibreOffice but also Collabor Online and it would be lovely to see you there.

246
0:20:17.760 --> 0:20:21.640
If you want to come and stay in a beautiful Cambridge College and wine and dine at our

247
0:20:21.640 --> 0:20:26.200
expense and have some team building and get stuck into Collabor Online, we'd love to have

248
0:20:26.200 --> 0:20:40.880
you with us. So thank you for your patience. Are there any questions? Yes, sir.

249
0:20:40.880 --> 0:20:44.640
When can we expect a chat GPT integration with Collabora?

250
0:20:44.640 --> 0:20:49.640
Well you know, like I say, yeah, when can we expect chat GPT integration with Collabora?

251
0:20:49.640 --> 0:20:53.160
I'm sorry, I have to repeat the question. Yes, so this is a really good question. I mean,

252
0:20:53.160 --> 0:20:57.560
ultimately, you can select some text and we can send that to you and you can send it back

253
0:20:57.560 --> 0:21:03.720
quite easily. But yeah, I mean, I think AI brings a whole lot of interesting challenges

254
0:21:03.720 --> 0:21:09.440
and I think, I don't know if you've looked at Office 365 and the AI slide improver, which

255
0:21:09.440 --> 0:21:14.800
I obviously should have used, you know. It makes your slides look pretty but the question

256
0:21:14.800 --> 0:21:19.880
is what are pretty slides? And you know, the real problem in AI is of course the training

257
0:21:19.880 --> 0:21:23.000
data. And one of our problems is that we like this digital sovereign world where we don't

258
0:21:23.000 --> 0:21:27.520
spy on people all the time to work out what they're doing to their documents, right? So

259
0:21:27.520 --> 0:21:31.640
Microsoft doesn't have this problem. They have Office 365 and they're constantly watching,

260
0:21:31.640 --> 0:21:35.320
you know. So they know how to make pretty slides just by watching millions of people

261
0:21:35.320 --> 0:21:41.000
go, colors a bit, and also offering you options of different ways to break or improve your

262
0:21:41.000 --> 0:21:48.640
slide and seeing what you choose. So yeah, I mean, how do we build the data sets to let

263
0:21:48.640 --> 0:21:53.920
us do this in an open source way? And I think AI is fantastically interesting and Bradley

264
0:21:53.920 --> 0:22:01.000
no doubt will come up with a Farrow AI license, you know. I'm sure this is happening because

265
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:06.240
the source is banal beyond belief in most AI, you know, things. It's the data and the

266
0:22:06.240 --> 0:22:11.600
training data and the model you build. So yeah, it would suck to be an open source company,

267
0:22:11.600 --> 0:22:15.800
100% open source code. It's just this massive binary blob that not even we understand that

268
0:22:15.800 --> 0:22:20.880
you have to buy, you know, to make it useful. So I don't know. We're working on the problem

269
0:22:20.880 --> 0:22:25.360
and there are a lot of smart minds thinking about putting AI and keeping that sovereign

270
0:22:25.360 --> 0:22:30.720
and on premise, but I don't have a perfect answer. But it's a fantastic question. And

271
0:22:30.720 --> 0:22:35.240
if you want to do a chat GPT, we should talk, you know, come and see me. I did mention we're

272
0:22:35.240 --> 0:22:38.680
hiring people. I'm probably not supposed to, but we love C++ hackers. If you come and see

273
0:22:38.680 --> 0:22:44.440
me, you know, we're growing fast and doing some cool things. Other questions? Anyone

274
0:22:44.440 --> 0:22:52.240
at all? No? More? Yeah? Well, that's very good of you then. Come and see me afterwards

275
0:22:52.240 --> 0:23:05.440
if you want to chat. Please do. Thank you so much.
