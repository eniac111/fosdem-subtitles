1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.800
First session, and I wanted to give you like explain a bit more, give an overview of the

2
0:00:11.800 --> 0:00:15.000
fields rights for those learning.

3
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:16.920
So I'm Nick Vidal.

4
0:00:16.920 --> 0:00:21.920
I'm part of the NRX, Community Manager at NRX.

5
0:00:21.920 --> 0:00:23.920
It's part of the Confidential Computing Consortium.

6
0:00:23.920 --> 0:00:25.720
It's an open source project.

7
0:00:25.720 --> 0:00:31.080
I'm also serving as the chair of the Outreach Committee from the Confidential Computing Consortium,

8
0:00:31.080 --> 0:00:33.800
and it's a pleasure to be here.

9
0:00:33.800 --> 0:00:39.660
So let's start out with talking about the states of data protection.

10
0:00:39.660 --> 0:00:40.920
This is very basic.

11
0:00:40.920 --> 0:00:47.280
I mean, everybody knows about protecting arrests, protecting data arrests, protecting data in

12
0:00:47.280 --> 0:00:50.360
transit, but now protecting EUs.

13
0:00:50.360 --> 0:00:53.680
This is something that is relatively new.

14
0:00:53.680 --> 0:00:56.960
So what exactly is protecting data arrests?

15
0:00:56.960 --> 0:01:04.560
When you have your hard drive encrypted, your laptop, your traveling, you get lost, that

16
0:01:04.560 --> 0:01:11.760
data is safe as long as your hard drive is encrypted and nobody can get in there.

17
0:01:11.760 --> 0:01:18.960
In transit, when you open up your browser and you just type HTTPS and you access some

18
0:01:18.960 --> 0:01:26.280
website, the data that's flowing between your browser and the server, if that's using HTTPS,

19
0:01:26.280 --> 0:01:31.200
that's encrypted and nobody can tamper into that data.

20
0:01:31.200 --> 0:01:32.200
That's secure.

21
0:01:32.200 --> 0:01:40.740
However, there's a third way that the data can also be accessible, and that's directly

22
0:01:40.740 --> 0:01:41.740
on the CPU.

23
0:01:41.740 --> 0:01:52.880
This is something that people mostly are not aware of, developers, even security professionals,

24
0:01:52.880 --> 0:02:01.880
and they are not aware that when you have some type of application or data running at

25
0:02:01.880 --> 0:02:08.520
the CPU in memory, if for some reason that system is compromised, somebody can get access

26
0:02:08.520 --> 0:02:11.240
to that data.

27
0:02:11.240 --> 0:02:16.880
Suppose that there's an exploit, somebody gains root access, they'll be able to see

28
0:02:16.880 --> 0:02:20.680
what's in memory.

29
0:02:20.680 --> 0:02:27.560
Conflash computing allows you to encrypt data while in use, while in the CPU.

30
0:02:27.560 --> 0:02:36.560
Even if somebody gains access, root access to that system, they won't have access to

31
0:02:36.560 --> 0:02:37.640
that data.

32
0:02:37.640 --> 0:02:49.360
Because it's just like the hard drive example, it's just like the data in transit example.

33
0:02:49.360 --> 0:02:57.280
Conflash computing protects data and the codes, both confidentiality and integrity.

34
0:02:57.280 --> 0:03:05.440
Confidentiality means you cannot actually read the data and integrity, you cannot mess

35
0:03:05.440 --> 0:03:11.040
up a tamper with that data or with that code.

36
0:03:11.040 --> 0:03:18.320
For confidential computing to have, to achieve confidential computing, you have to at least

37
0:03:18.320 --> 0:03:25.480
provide data confidentiality, data integrity, and codes integrity.

38
0:03:25.480 --> 0:03:29.680
How about codes confidentiality?

39
0:03:29.680 --> 0:03:34.560
As part of the confidential computing consortium's definition of confidential computing, that's

40
0:03:34.560 --> 0:03:46.000
not necessary, but some projects like the NRX projects, we provide all those protections.

41
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:51.760
This is the official definition by the confidential computing consortium.

42
0:03:51.760 --> 0:03:57.840
Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based,

43
0:03:57.840 --> 0:04:21.840
out-tested, trusted, and managed sensitive and regulated data.

44
0:04:21.840 --> 0:04:30.760
I wanted to read that because the CCC worked, a whole bunch of people worked together during

45
0:04:30.760 --> 0:04:39.240
one year to define this definition and another year to add one word attested.

46
0:04:39.240 --> 0:04:46.280
I wanted to read very clearly to make this definition so I wouldn't make a mistake.

47
0:04:46.280 --> 0:04:51.760
I don't want to memorize it and forget something.

48
0:04:51.760 --> 0:04:53.920
What's confidential computing?

49
0:04:53.920 --> 0:04:55.200
What's the case study?

50
0:04:55.200 --> 0:04:57.560
Where can it be used?

51
0:04:57.560 --> 0:04:59.600
Actually it has many uses.

52
0:04:59.600 --> 0:05:04.240
Right now we have some sectors that are very much regulated.

53
0:05:04.240 --> 0:05:11.760
They have a lot of sensitive data and in fact they cannot use the clouds as of today.

54
0:05:11.760 --> 0:05:15.120
They simply can't.

55
0:05:15.120 --> 0:05:19.480
Policies won't allow them to benefit from the clouds.

56
0:05:19.480 --> 0:05:23.440
So we have, for example, banking, financial services, insurance.

57
0:05:23.440 --> 0:05:27.360
Of course they have a lot of sensitive financial data.

58
0:05:27.360 --> 0:05:30.160
We also have healthcare.

59
0:05:30.160 --> 0:05:33.200
There's the HIPAA, for example, in the US.

60
0:05:33.200 --> 0:05:37.560
It's regulation regarding healthcare.

61
0:05:37.560 --> 0:05:45.560
We have telecom, edge, IOT, governments, a whole bunch of sectors that currently do not

62
0:05:45.560 --> 0:05:51.080
use the clouds because they can't, because they have a lot of sensitive data, because

63
0:05:51.080 --> 0:05:55.000
it's very much regulated by governments, policies.

64
0:05:55.000 --> 0:06:04.760
So confidential computing will open the clouds, the IOT, the edge through these sectors.

65
0:06:04.760 --> 0:06:07.120
They have a lot of sensitive data.

66
0:06:07.120 --> 0:06:12.840
And that's the huge potential of this technology.

67
0:06:12.840 --> 0:06:21.000
If we can open up these, the clouds through these sectors, you'll grow a lot.

68
0:06:21.000 --> 0:06:26.640
That's one of the reasons why cloud service providers are currently, this year and this

69
0:06:26.640 --> 0:06:34.480
past year, they have offered confidential computing and this is going to grow immensely.

70
0:06:34.480 --> 0:06:40.200
So I talked about the confidential computing consortium.

71
0:06:40.200 --> 0:06:42.640
We are part of the Linux Foundation.

72
0:06:42.640 --> 0:06:51.120
We bring together hardware vendors like Intel, AMD, ARM, Nvidia, cloud service providers

73
0:06:51.120 --> 0:07:02.120
like Azure, Google clouds, and so many others, startups as well, and software developers.

74
0:07:02.120 --> 0:07:04.200
We have a whole bunch of members here.

75
0:07:04.200 --> 0:07:11.160
As you can see, all the major players are betting on this because in some ways this

76
0:07:11.160 --> 0:07:17.720
is the future of the clouds in terms of security.

77
0:07:17.720 --> 0:07:21.960
And we have, currently we have seven open source projects.

78
0:07:21.960 --> 0:07:28.320
We invite as many open source projects, if you are working with confidential computing

79
0:07:28.320 --> 0:07:32.680
and you have a nice project, we welcome you to the CCC.

80
0:07:32.680 --> 0:07:39.880
So I work at the Anark, but we have Gramin, we have Veracruz, Veracone, a lot of very

81
0:07:39.880 --> 0:07:45.400
great technology here, which is fully open source.

82
0:07:45.400 --> 0:07:52.160
Now let's step back and look at the Let's Encrypt movement.

83
0:07:52.160 --> 0:07:58.360
Not many people are aware of confidential computing and its importance of protecting

84
0:07:58.360 --> 0:08:01.280
data while in use.

85
0:08:01.280 --> 0:08:08.840
If we go back 10, 15 years ago, that was the same challenge that we had regarding protecting

86
0:08:08.840 --> 0:08:11.680
data in transit.

87
0:08:11.680 --> 0:08:18.160
People were like, hey, I'm not an e-commerce, I'm not like a bank, or why should I use HTTPS,

88
0:08:18.160 --> 0:08:19.520
right?

89
0:08:19.520 --> 0:08:24.400
We kind of left right now, hey, HTTPS is just the default, right?

90
0:08:24.400 --> 0:08:25.400
It's very easy.

91
0:08:25.400 --> 0:08:29.000
Why we shouldn't have this as the default?

92
0:08:29.000 --> 0:08:34.600
Everyone from whatever, you have your own blog, it doesn't have any sensitive data,

93
0:08:34.600 --> 0:08:40.040
so even so, you're going to use HTTPS because it's easy, it's convenient, and it's just

94
0:08:40.040 --> 0:08:41.960
more secure.

95
0:08:41.960 --> 0:08:51.640
This same mindset is what we need to change for people to start really thinking about

96
0:08:51.640 --> 0:08:55.040
data in use, of protecting data in use.

97
0:08:55.040 --> 0:08:58.400
And it will make everything so much secure.

98
0:08:58.400 --> 0:09:07.440
It doesn't matter if your system gets hacked, if everyone has roots access to it, even so,

99
0:09:07.440 --> 0:09:09.320
it's not game over.

100
0:09:09.320 --> 0:09:11.420
Your data is still secure.

101
0:09:11.420 --> 0:09:19.160
We hear in the news all the time about all the vulnerabilities, and this could have been

102
0:09:19.160 --> 0:09:04.540
prevented by using Conf

103
0:09:04.540 --> 0:09:34.320
So, landscape crypt, it was started in 2012 by four people, two from Mozilla, one from

104
0:09:34.320 --> 0:09:38.880
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and from the University of Michigan.

105
0:09:38.880 --> 0:09:42.140
It's the world's largest certificate authority.

106
0:09:42.140 --> 0:09:52.620
It provides free TLS encryption, and the goal is to really make the web safer using HTTPS.

107
0:09:52.620 --> 0:09:56.280
They have a lot of sponsors and partners.

108
0:09:56.280 --> 0:10:00.360
As I mentioned, they're part of the Linux Foundation, the Linux Foundation helps them,

109
0:10:00.360 --> 0:10:04.460
as a partner, also the Mozilla Foundation, EFF.

110
0:10:04.460 --> 0:10:12.700
There's a whole group of people that see the importance of having HTTPS by default today.

111
0:10:12.700 --> 0:10:19.740
And what makes it possible is that they have developed software that's very easy to use,

112
0:10:19.740 --> 0:10:27.880
that makes it just, it's a very easy process to enable HTTPS.

113
0:10:27.880 --> 0:10:38.960
So they have the Acma protocol, and they have those who have provided open up search bots.

114
0:10:38.960 --> 0:10:40.200
You know what that is?

115
0:10:40.200 --> 0:10:46.140
That's the Python application that creates a certificate, right?

116
0:10:46.140 --> 0:10:48.760
And on the server side, they have Boulder.

117
0:10:48.760 --> 0:10:55.840
And these technologies, this software, and this protocol, they make it really easy to

118
0:10:55.840 --> 0:11:00.920
achieve HTTPS by default.

119
0:11:00.920 --> 0:11:04.200
So I'm not sure if you can see really well here.

120
0:11:04.200 --> 0:11:09.240
The contrast is not really good, but you can see the growth here.

121
0:11:09.240 --> 0:11:10.240
So this is the...

122
0:11:10.240 --> 0:11:14.280
It's quite well on the stream if you happen to have the right...

123
0:11:14.280 --> 0:11:19.600
So this is the start of the project.

124
0:11:19.600 --> 0:11:24.720
I can't actually see the ears here.

125
0:11:24.720 --> 0:11:27.120
But as you can see, it's growing, right?

126
0:11:27.120 --> 0:11:29.760
It has grown a lot.

127
0:11:29.760 --> 0:11:37.040
Especially here, I'm not sure what happened here, but this is how many certificates they

128
0:11:37.040 --> 0:11:42.360
have given rights.

129
0:11:42.360 --> 0:11:44.840
And so it's very successful.

130
0:11:44.840 --> 0:11:52.680
Let's Encrypt is one of the most successful achievements to help secure the web.

131
0:11:52.680 --> 0:11:55.900
And how did they accomplish this?

132
0:11:55.900 --> 0:12:02.520
What can the confidential computing community learn from the Let's Encrypt movements?

133
0:12:02.520 --> 0:12:09.160
So here are some key ideas that I thought about, but you can also explore this.

134
0:12:09.160 --> 0:12:12.020
And this can be an open discussion as well.

135
0:12:12.020 --> 0:12:20.720
So first of all, make a campaign that brings this awareness around the importance of encrypting

136
0:12:20.720 --> 0:12:23.480
data while in use.

137
0:12:23.480 --> 0:12:28.720
The same way that Let's Encrypt did this for data in transit.

138
0:12:28.720 --> 0:12:32.200
For us, HTTPS is just the default way.

139
0:12:32.200 --> 0:12:35.200
We can't think of any other way of doing this.

140
0:12:35.200 --> 0:12:39.880
Why would we use HTTP only, right?

141
0:12:39.880 --> 0:12:41.840
Even for a blog or whatever.

142
0:12:41.840 --> 0:12:45.160
It just makes sense.

143
0:12:45.160 --> 0:12:49.920
So adoption by TEs, by cloud service providers.

144
0:12:49.920 --> 0:12:51.960
This is happening right now.

145
0:12:51.960 --> 0:12:59.120
So all the major cloud service providers are really making this generally available.

146
0:12:59.120 --> 0:13:04.800
And they're a bit expensive right now, but they should become more affordable in the

147
0:13:04.800 --> 0:13:06.840
future.

148
0:13:06.840 --> 0:13:13.000
Of course, all the hardware developers, they have made the technologies available.

149
0:13:13.000 --> 0:13:15.320
So Intel, ARM.

150
0:13:15.320 --> 0:13:18.520
ARM is still going to release this.

151
0:13:18.520 --> 0:13:20.560
But you have AMD as well.

152
0:13:20.560 --> 0:13:27.200
They have invested a lot, sometimes even a decade, right, in terms of Intel, SGX.

153
0:13:27.200 --> 0:13:32.000
We have to develop software that makes it really easy to deploy computer computing.

154
0:13:32.000 --> 0:13:36.360
So one of the projects is Enarx.

155
0:13:36.360 --> 0:13:38.240
We make it really easy.

156
0:13:38.240 --> 0:13:42.760
We use WebAssembly to allow developers to deploy applications.

157
0:13:42.760 --> 0:13:47.360
And it's really nice if you want to check that out.

158
0:13:47.360 --> 0:13:50.160
We have to abstract the complexities.

159
0:13:50.160 --> 0:13:52.120
Complex computing is really complex.

160
0:13:52.120 --> 0:13:54.160
You have to know about encryption.

161
0:13:54.160 --> 0:14:02.760
You have to learn about attestation, about the different models that exist to achieve

162
0:14:02.760 --> 0:14:04.480
computational computing.

163
0:14:04.480 --> 0:14:11.640
And the software has to abstract all those complexities if you want to gain market share,

164
0:14:11.640 --> 0:14:12.640
right?

165
0:14:12.640 --> 0:14:15.520
It has to be CSP neutral.

166
0:14:15.520 --> 0:14:19.520
It has to be hardware neutral, preferably.

167
0:14:19.520 --> 0:14:25.640
The developer doesn't have to know if his application is going to run on AMD or Intel

168
0:14:25.640 --> 0:14:26.640
or whatever.

169
0:14:26.640 --> 0:14:28.760
It just should work.

170
0:14:28.760 --> 0:14:33.360
He's going to deploy this application and it will just, complex computing will just,

171
0:14:33.360 --> 0:14:36.120
everything will be encrypted.

172
0:14:36.120 --> 0:14:39.720
And he doesn't have to care about attestation or whatever.

173
0:14:39.720 --> 0:14:41.040
Just works.

174
0:14:41.040 --> 0:14:44.400
Just like Let's Encrypts.

175
0:14:44.400 --> 0:14:45.520
Promotes open source software.

176
0:14:45.520 --> 0:14:48.280
I believe open source plays a very important role here.

177
0:14:48.280 --> 0:14:53.840
And the Confidential Computing Consortium has this as part of its mission to promote

178
0:14:53.840 --> 0:14:55.120
open source software.

179
0:14:55.120 --> 0:14:59.980
That's why we adopted setting open source projects here.

180
0:14:59.980 --> 0:15:02.080
We have to make it affordable.

181
0:15:02.080 --> 0:15:05.360
And right now it's very niche.

182
0:15:05.360 --> 0:15:10.800
But we have to see that maybe in five years, this is just going to be the default way,

183
0:15:10.800 --> 0:15:11.800
right?

184
0:15:11.800 --> 0:15:15.480
Maybe eventually it might even be free.

185
0:15:15.480 --> 0:15:19.800
So we want to commoditize Confidential Computing at some point, right?

186
0:15:19.800 --> 0:15:24.400
To make this a reality by default.

187
0:15:24.400 --> 0:15:30.340
And so with that, I would like to thank you for hearing me.

188
0:15:30.340 --> 0:15:35.680
You can get in touch with us at the Confidential Computing Consortium using this email.

189
0:15:35.680 --> 0:15:38.840
And I invite you to join our tech meetings.

190
0:15:38.840 --> 0:15:41.560
It happens every other week.

191
0:15:41.560 --> 0:15:45.080
And also our outreach meetings.

192
0:15:45.080 --> 0:15:52.720
If you want to really learn or share your technical ideas, I recommend joining the tech

193
0:15:52.720 --> 0:15:59.320
committee and outreach if you want to expand this idea and promote it.

194
0:15:59.320 --> 0:16:00.920
So thank you very much.

195
0:16:00.920 --> 0:16:01.920
And that's it.

196
0:16:01.920 --> 0:16:12.560
Do we have some time for questions?

197
0:16:12.560 --> 0:16:13.560
Yes, we have.

198
0:16:13.560 --> 0:16:14.560
The first block is a little bit cramped.

199
0:16:14.560 --> 0:16:17.560
So there's a little bit less time for questions in the first block.

200
0:16:17.560 --> 0:16:22.080
But can you feel free to ask some?

201
0:16:22.080 --> 0:16:28.120
And I think you're also around the rest of today to answer any questions.

202
0:16:28.120 --> 0:16:33.200
So with TLS, I have the feeling that the infrastructure was already there.

203
0:16:33.200 --> 0:16:37.280
It was just a problem of it was too complicated.

204
0:16:37.280 --> 0:16:42.600
And with Confidential Computing as a developer, I don't really even know where to start.

205
0:16:42.600 --> 0:16:45.120
The infrastructure is coming.

206
0:16:45.120 --> 0:16:50.200
The CSPs, they're really adopting Confidential Computing.

207
0:16:50.200 --> 0:16:56.000
We had heard some announcements, especially last year, of making this technology generally

208
0:16:56.000 --> 0:16:57.640
available.

209
0:16:57.640 --> 0:17:00.440
Really, the prices need to drop.

210
0:17:00.440 --> 0:17:04.280
You must make it really easy for people to adapt this.

211
0:17:04.280 --> 0:17:09.760
I currently can't use it on my laptop, for example.

212
0:17:09.760 --> 0:17:19.360
Confidential Computing is mostly targeted for the server side or the edge or IoT.

213
0:17:19.360 --> 0:17:26.440
There are some, the Intel SGX for the PC or for the laptop.

214
0:17:26.440 --> 0:17:31.360
In fact, they were degraded.

215
0:17:31.360 --> 0:17:34.000
Intel's not supporting this anymore.

216
0:17:34.000 --> 0:17:37.360
But yeah, you're right.

217
0:17:37.360 --> 0:17:38.360
So one second.

218
0:17:38.360 --> 0:17:44.360
Andrew, the next speaker could maybe already set up while we have the next question.

219
0:17:44.360 --> 0:17:46.360
Maybe go ahead.

220
0:17:46.360 --> 0:17:50.360
Thank you for a very nice talk.

221
0:17:50.360 --> 0:17:55.360
So you were talking about this definition of Confidential Computing, that Confidential

222
0:17:55.360 --> 0:18:00.200
Computing Consortium had decided on the kind of mentioned entity.

223
0:18:00.200 --> 0:18:03.200
One year, you had attested this definition.

224
0:18:03.200 --> 0:18:04.200
Why was that?

225
0:18:04.200 --> 0:18:06.280
Why was it there in the first?

226
0:18:06.280 --> 0:18:07.280
Yeah.

227
0:18:07.280 --> 0:18:12.800
So attestation was not part of the first definition.

228
0:18:12.800 --> 0:18:18.080
The reason why is because attestation is really complex and maybe it wasn't given as much

229
0:18:18.080 --> 0:18:26.320
importance as before, but once attestation became a really big discussion after.

230
0:18:26.320 --> 0:18:30.280
In fact, they created a special interest group around attestation.

231
0:18:30.280 --> 0:18:48.800
And that's when they decided to add it.
