WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.520
Okay.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.520
Hello.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.820
I'm Johnny Bradley.

00:27.820 --> 00:36.520
I work on the Tiki project as a developer and have done for about 20 years, I think.

00:36.520 --> 00:42.240
But I'm not going to do the usual, this is the new stuff in Tiki 25 talk because there's

00:42.240 --> 00:48.280
a lot of it and I thought I would concentrate on something more collaborative.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.800
So this is about markdown.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.960
I'm assuming everyone knows what markdown is and uses it.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.320
If not, we can work it out afterwards.

00:58.320 --> 01:02.640
Sorry, there is a microphone because we can hear it.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.920
Yeah, it's a microphone but only for online people.

01:05.920 --> 01:06.920
Okay.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
Yeah, sorry.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.680
I'll try and project.

01:12.680 --> 01:20.960
In the old days, we had BB code starting off which was like HTML with square brackets and

01:20.960 --> 01:26.200
media Wiki obviously everywhere then I found Tiki had its own syntax.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.200
It uses little quote marks instead of asterisk that kind of thing and each time you change

01:31.200 --> 01:35.040
to a different platform, you have to look up in the cheat sheets.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.560
How do I do underline?

01:36.560 --> 01:38.360
Is it underscores?

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Is it asterisk?

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
Whatever.

01:40.360 --> 01:47.720
And more and more in the last few years, we've been finding markdown has appeared more and

01:47.720 --> 01:56.360
more mainly from GitHub and GitLab and the best thing would be if there was just one,

01:56.360 --> 02:01.160
one syntax to rule them all.

02:01.160 --> 02:09.440
In the very olden days, early noughties, there was a project called Wiki Creole which XWiki,

02:09.440 --> 02:11.840
TikiWiki was nearly involved with.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.240
We didn't implement it but XWiki I believe did.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.000
It's based on Wiki Creole.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Right.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Just do that.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay, cool.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.680
TiddlyWiki which I always like the name.

02:24.680 --> 02:32.760
DokiWiki, lots of other friends and yeah, but the project stalled.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.160
It didn't quite make it.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.880
I think apparently because MediaWiki just had too much stuff that they couldn't migrate

02:38.880 --> 02:43.440
to a different syntax so it'll ground to a halt.

02:43.440 --> 02:50.360
There was about the same time there was the PHP pair classes which you could do an interchange

02:50.360 --> 02:56.320
with Wiki Creole to MediaWiki to Tiki.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.480
We still use that even though it's not supported anymore.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.120
Oh yeah.

03:05.120 --> 03:12.600
So we need another standard and Jean-Marc insisted that I should put this cartoon in.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.440
This is the original script.

03:14.440 --> 03:19.120
So let's have one more standard.

03:19.120 --> 03:24.680
Here comes Markdown and this was the reason for the title of this talk is I just had this

03:24.680 --> 03:28.040
idea of Markdown taking over the world.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.240
A bit like Godzilla destroying a city.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.920
Markdown was started in 2004.

03:37.920 --> 03:46.360
It was basically a pearl script I believe and over the years more and more people implemented

03:46.360 --> 03:52.840
different versions of it and it became a bunch of different standards.

03:52.840 --> 04:01.560
So then CommonMark project was initiated about 10 years ago and that seemed to be the best

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
of breed.

04:02.560 --> 04:12.280
It's a Creative Commons definition of how it should work with a test suite and basically

04:12.280 --> 04:17.880
that seems to be the standard adopted by most people.

04:17.880 --> 04:26.000
But obviously it doesn't do everything so many people extended it mainly GitHub so GitHub

04:26.000 --> 04:34.120
flavored Markdown seems to be the generic standard for most places and that is now used

04:34.120 --> 04:41.920
by GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow, People Without Logos, Next Cloud we just heard were

04:41.920 --> 04:43.920
there early on.

04:43.920 --> 04:50.640
Discord, Icon Broken, Bugzilla and now even the proprietary softwares like Facebook and

04:50.640 --> 04:58.400
WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and so on are using it and so we thought Tiki should use it as

04:58.400 --> 04:59.400
well.

04:59.400 --> 05:06.120
So in Tiki 25 we've adopted Markdown, we've always had our own syntax so that carries

05:06.120 --> 05:12.880
on working and now its default is off but you can enable it and it's a little bit alpha

05:12.880 --> 05:15.480
but improving.

05:15.480 --> 05:20.880
The next release hopefully it will become the default syntax and then at some point

05:20.880 --> 05:27.880
in the future Tiki syntax will become read only and will be Markdown like the rest of

05:27.880 --> 05:31.080
the world we assume.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.800
And of course we need our own flavor of it.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.520
One thing was a little surprise to me that you can't do centered text in Markdown that

05:39.520 --> 05:45.440
is outside of the scope of it but all our clients will want to do centered text so we

05:45.440 --> 05:50.560
use, misleadingly in Tiki these are called plugins but you don't have to plug them in

05:50.560 --> 05:51.560
they're just in there.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.360
They're more like WordPress shortcodes I guess.

05:55.360 --> 06:01.880
So yeah you want to center something, you want to do it in a box, formatting tools,

06:01.880 --> 06:03.040
user lists and so on.

06:03.040 --> 06:12.720
I think there's about 250 plugins in Tiki which will carry on working but in Markdown

06:12.720 --> 06:15.840
scope.

06:15.840 --> 06:24.440
We also use CKEditor for our existing WYSIWYG offering.

06:24.440 --> 06:31.680
We decided to review that partly because the licensing changes of CKEditor 5 or 6 is it?

06:31.680 --> 06:35.480
Seems to be a little more challenging.

06:35.480 --> 06:43.800
So we went for ToastUE which is a native Markdown WYSIWYG editor.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.800
Seems very promising.

06:44.800 --> 06:53.280
Again 25.0 it's a little alpha but does the job.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.000
That's about it I'm really under time aren't I?

06:58.000 --> 07:05.040
So yeah you can find out more about our Markdown there Tiki25 which I could go on to.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.760
We have a lot of new stuff in there.

07:08.760 --> 07:17.800
You can play with it on demo.tiki.org and a recap of everything on our wiki page.

07:17.800 --> 07:27.240
I just wanted to say thanks to Mark Laporte who was Tiki leader for a long time and is

07:27.240 --> 07:34.360
still looking after us and he's sort of spearheaded this initiative.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.480
Markdown WYSIWYG editor who did a lot of the backend coding.

07:37.480 --> 07:44.960
I have a MOBA group who initiated the whole thing because they wanted better WYSIWYG and

07:44.960 --> 07:50.640
some mysterious third anonymous benefactor.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.960
That's about it.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.960
Are there any questions?

07:56.960 --> 08:14.640
We have some nice reports that you are most welcome and we have I believe 16 minutes.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.120
16 minutes yeah I should have done more slides.

08:18.120 --> 08:31.080
Yes, yes we have.

08:31.080 --> 08:39.240
So the question was can we can we convert from Tiki Markdown into Markdown Tiki syntax

08:39.240 --> 08:40.920
into Markdown and back again.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.120
Yes we can.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.640
The more you do it the more the page will go weird because there are some things that

08:46.640 --> 08:52.600
are supported in different ways in the different languages but yeah each wiki page has a little

08:52.600 --> 08:59.240
cog icon you get a little dialogue saying do you want it in WYSIWYG or plain editor

08:59.240 --> 09:04.240
and you want it in Tiki or Markdown syntax and it's surprising we weren't expecting

09:04.240 --> 09:05.720
that for Tiki 25.

09:05.720 --> 09:09.640
We're quite pleased that's working already.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.640
Again that will improve.

09:12.640 --> 09:22.600
Yes sir I looked at the common mark specification and basically lacks things which I used from

09:22.600 --> 09:27.600
PHP Markdown extra like tables definition list.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.040
Is there any current Markdown which implements those?

09:33.040 --> 09:40.320
Yes GitHub flavored Markdown sorry yeah repeat the question repeat the question.

09:40.320 --> 09:48.400
So specifically you're asking about tables and other features whether those are supported

09:48.400 --> 09:57.920
in Markdown they're not in the core common mark specification but GitHub flavored Markdown

09:57.920 --> 10:02.240
adds tables and a bunch of other things.

10:02.240 --> 10:08.320
Some things that GitHub do like references to other commits and pull requests and so

10:08.320 --> 10:11.440
on we don't use.

10:11.440 --> 10:18.240
Again Tiki flavored Markdown has our plug-in system so there's another 250 so you can do

10:18.240 --> 10:23.760
search results you can build quite complicated applications.

10:23.760 --> 10:30.800
We're still working out what's missing so I guess we'll get feedback over the next few

10:30.800 --> 10:35.560
months as to what people want to do and still can't.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.560
Yes sir.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.560
First one remark if people are interested we have a converter in XWixi with XWixi rendering

10:42.560 --> 10:46.560
supports many many syntaxes and is able to convert from one to another including from

10:46.560 --> 10:50.560
HTML so if you can convert something to HTML you could actually convert it to any of the

10:50.560 --> 10:57.560
syntaxes that XWixi rendering supports including Markdown common Markdown, GitHub, and many other

10:57.560 --> 10:59.560
like Tiki etc.

10:59.560 --> 11:06.560
I have a question on the did you have a problem for the WYSIWYG with the allowance to do inline

11:06.560 --> 11:15.560
HTML in Markdown to make WYSIWYG go back and forth to come back to the Markdown syntax?

11:15.560 --> 11:22.800
Yes in the Alpha sorry yeah did we have a problem converting from one syntax to the

11:22.800 --> 11:29.320
other where you get little stray bits of HTML creeping into the wiki markup which we obviously

11:29.320 --> 11:32.240
sanitize afterwards.

11:32.240 --> 11:37.800
I think we've nailed all those yes there were some challenges with that in the Alpha stages

11:37.800 --> 11:45.520
and I kept on finding that a bold Markdown tag would then suddenly appear as little HTML

11:45.520 --> 11:48.000
bold tags.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.440
Part of that I think is Toast does some of that.

11:53.440 --> 12:01.880
Then it's the initial release and it's still marked as experimental so yeah I found I don't

12:01.880 --> 12:08.200
know yeah I found Toast community to be a little bit sort of read-only.

12:08.200 --> 12:13.760
I haven't found much of a chat if anyone knows where to talk to the Toast developers better

12:13.760 --> 12:21.440
then I would like to do that and I did the Toast implementation but yes it's something

12:21.440 --> 12:25.840
we're watching out for.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
Yes Sean?

12:26.840 --> 12:34.840
The nice thing with common Mark is that there is an advert for public specification with

12:34.840 --> 12:37.840
tests and all that which is quite tough.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
Is that all leaving?

12:38.840 --> 12:39.840
Are we?

12:39.840 --> 12:40.840
Is it possible that there will be a version 2?

12:40.840 --> 12:53.960
Because we can't be the only people wanting to add good lists and tables.

12:53.960 --> 13:00.840
Yeah the question was is there going to be a common Mark version 2?

13:00.840 --> 13:04.760
I don't know anyone else got any ideas?

13:04.760 --> 13:10.000
It seems to be is designed to be very complete and it's designed to be very simple so possibly

13:10.000 --> 13:17.040
not I guess we have to wait and see.

13:17.040 --> 13:23.520
As an aside I found out the MIDI you know the music interface system that is still version

13:23.520 --> 13:30.480
1.0 and that started in the 80s so maybe it doesn't need upgrading.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
Hello.

13:32.480 --> 13:47.560
I'm just now playing around with myself generating HTML from Markdown.

13:47.560 --> 13:54.040
I was wondering if you have any advice on how to go about it, what tools you can find

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
yourself.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.320
Depends which language you're writing it in.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.320
Oh yeah sorry.

13:58.320 --> 14:06.280
Are there any tools and libraries you're asking to convert Markdown to HTML?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.720
Yes there's a lot.

14:08.720 --> 14:17.760
We're using the PHP League, common Mark because we're a PHP application, which does most of

14:17.760 --> 14:24.640
the Markdown to HTML conversion and I believe the HTML back to Markdown because again we

14:24.640 --> 14:30.640
go via HTML when we're doing conversion process.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
Which language are you in?

14:32.640 --> 14:37.640
I think for me it would be Python.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.520
They're bound to be surely.

14:39.520 --> 14:48.040
I don't know the Python world that well so I'm guessing there'd be a link on probably

14:48.040 --> 14:55.280
on the common Mark website, commonmark.org, you should have a list of all of the libraries

14:55.280 --> 14:57.280
and implementations.

14:57.280 --> 15:11.200
Okay so spend the rest of the half hour as you wish unless there's any more questions.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
I'll leave it to it.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.200
Thank you.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
Thank you.

15:14.200 --> 15:20.960
Indeed we'll have a short break.
