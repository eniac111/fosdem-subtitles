1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:25.520
Okay.

2
0:00:25.520 --> 0:00:26.520
Hello.

3
0:00:26.520 --> 0:00:27.820
I'm Johnny Bradley.

4
0:00:27.820 --> 0:00:36.520
I work on the Tiki project as a developer and have done for about 20 years, I think.

5
0:00:36.520 --> 0:00:42.240
But I'm not going to do the usual, this is the new stuff in Tiki 25 talk because there's

6
0:00:42.240 --> 0:00:48.280
a lot of it and I thought I would concentrate on something more collaborative.

7
0:00:48.280 --> 0:00:50.800
So this is about markdown.

8
0:00:50.800 --> 0:00:54.960
I'm assuming everyone knows what markdown is and uses it.

9
0:00:54.960 --> 0:00:58.320
If not, we can work it out afterwards.

10
0:00:58.320 --> 0:01:02.640
Sorry, there is a microphone because we can hear it.

11
0:01:02.640 --> 0:01:05.920
Yeah, it's a microphone but only for online people.

12
0:01:05.920 --> 0:01:06.920
Okay.

13
0:01:06.920 --> 0:01:07.920
Yeah, sorry.

14
0:01:07.920 --> 0:01:12.680
I'll try and project.

15
0:01:12.680 --> 0:01:20.960
In the old days, we had BB code starting off which was like HTML with square brackets and

16
0:01:20.960 --> 0:01:26.200
media Wiki obviously everywhere then I found Tiki had its own syntax.

17
0:01:26.200 --> 0:01:31.200
It uses little quote marks instead of asterisk that kind of thing and each time you change

18
0:01:31.200 --> 0:01:35.040
to a different platform, you have to look up in the cheat sheets.

19
0:01:35.040 --> 0:01:36.560
How do I do underline?

20
0:01:36.560 --> 0:01:38.360
Is it underscores?

21
0:01:38.360 --> 0:01:39.360
Is it asterisk?

22
0:01:39.360 --> 0:01:40.360
Whatever.

23
0:01:40.360 --> 0:01:47.720
And more and more in the last few years, we've been finding markdown has appeared more and

24
0:01:47.720 --> 0:01:56.360
more mainly from GitHub and GitLab and the best thing would be if there was just one,

25
0:01:56.360 --> 0:02:01.160
one syntax to rule them all.

26
0:02:01.160 --> 0:02:09.440
In the very olden days, early noughties, there was a project called Wiki Creole which XWiki,

27
0:02:09.440 --> 0:02:11.840
TikiWiki was nearly involved with.

28
0:02:11.840 --> 0:02:15.240
We didn't implement it but XWiki I believe did.

29
0:02:15.240 --> 0:02:18.000
It's based on Wiki Creole.

30
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:19.000
Right.

31
0:02:19.000 --> 0:02:20.000
Just do that.

32
0:02:20.000 --> 0:02:21.000
Okay, cool.

33
0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:24.680
TiddlyWiki which I always like the name.

34
0:02:24.680 --> 0:02:32.760
DokiWiki, lots of other friends and yeah, but the project stalled.

35
0:02:32.760 --> 0:02:34.160
It didn't quite make it.

36
0:02:34.160 --> 0:02:38.880
I think apparently because MediaWiki just had too much stuff that they couldn't migrate

37
0:02:38.880 --> 0:02:43.440
to a different syntax so it'll ground to a halt.

38
0:02:43.440 --> 0:02:50.360
There was about the same time there was the PHP pair classes which you could do an interchange

39
0:02:50.360 --> 0:02:56.320
with Wiki Creole to MediaWiki to Tiki.

40
0:02:56.320 --> 0:03:00.480
We still use that even though it's not supported anymore.

41
0:03:00.480 --> 0:03:05.120
Oh yeah.

42
0:03:05.120 --> 0:03:12.600
So we need another standard and Jean-Marc insisted that I should put this cartoon in.

43
0:03:12.600 --> 0:03:14.440
This is the original script.

44
0:03:14.440 --> 0:03:19.120
So let's have one more standard.

45
0:03:19.120 --> 0:03:24.680
Here comes Markdown and this was the reason for the title of this talk is I just had this

46
0:03:24.680 --> 0:03:28.040
idea of Markdown taking over the world.

47
0:03:28.040 --> 0:03:33.240
A bit like Godzilla destroying a city.

48
0:03:33.240 --> 0:03:37.920
Markdown was started in 2004.

49
0:03:37.920 --> 0:03:46.360
It was basically a pearl script I believe and over the years more and more people implemented

50
0:03:46.360 --> 0:03:52.840
different versions of it and it became a bunch of different standards.

51
0:03:52.840 --> 0:04:01.560
So then CommonMark project was initiated about 10 years ago and that seemed to be the best

52
0:04:01.560 --> 0:04:02.560
of breed.

53
0:04:02.560 --> 0:04:12.280
It's a Creative Commons definition of how it should work with a test suite and basically

54
0:04:12.280 --> 0:04:17.880
that seems to be the standard adopted by most people.

55
0:04:17.880 --> 0:04:26.000
But obviously it doesn't do everything so many people extended it mainly GitHub so GitHub

56
0:04:26.000 --> 0:04:34.120
flavored Markdown seems to be the generic standard for most places and that is now used

57
0:04:34.120 --> 0:04:41.920
by GitHub, GitLab, Stack Overflow, People Without Logos, Next Cloud we just heard were

58
0:04:41.920 --> 0:04:43.920
there early on.

59
0:04:43.920 --> 0:04:50.640
Discord, Icon Broken, Bugzilla and now even the proprietary softwares like Facebook and

60
0:04:50.640 --> 0:04:58.400
WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and so on are using it and so we thought Tiki should use it as

61
0:04:58.400 --> 0:04:59.400
well.

62
0:04:59.400 --> 0:05:06.120
So in Tiki 25 we've adopted Markdown, we've always had our own syntax so that carries

63
0:05:06.120 --> 0:05:12.880
on working and now its default is off but you can enable it and it's a little bit alpha

64
0:05:12.880 --> 0:05:15.480
but improving.

65
0:05:15.480 --> 0:05:20.880
The next release hopefully it will become the default syntax and then at some point

66
0:05:20.880 --> 0:05:27.880
in the future Tiki syntax will become read only and will be Markdown like the rest of

67
0:05:27.880 --> 0:05:31.080
the world we assume.

68
0:05:31.080 --> 0:05:34.800
And of course we need our own flavor of it.

69
0:05:34.800 --> 0:05:39.520
One thing was a little surprise to me that you can't do centered text in Markdown that

70
0:05:39.520 --> 0:05:45.440
is outside of the scope of it but all our clients will want to do centered text so we

71
0:05:45.440 --> 0:05:50.560
use, misleadingly in Tiki these are called plugins but you don't have to plug them in

72
0:05:50.560 --> 0:05:51.560
they're just in there.

73
0:05:51.560 --> 0:05:55.360
They're more like WordPress shortcodes I guess.

74
0:05:55.360 --> 0:06:01.880
So yeah you want to center something, you want to do it in a box, formatting tools,

75
0:06:01.880 --> 0:06:03.040
user lists and so on.

76
0:06:03.040 --> 0:06:12.720
I think there's about 250 plugins in Tiki which will carry on working but in Markdown

77
0:06:12.720 --> 0:06:15.840
scope.

78
0:06:15.840 --> 0:06:24.440
We also use CKEditor for our existing WYSIWYG offering.

79
0:06:24.440 --> 0:06:31.680
We decided to review that partly because the licensing changes of CKEditor 5 or 6 is it?

80
0:06:31.680 --> 0:06:35.480
Seems to be a little more challenging.

81
0:06:35.480 --> 0:06:43.800
So we went for ToastUE which is a native Markdown WYSIWYG editor.

82
0:06:43.800 --> 0:06:44.800
Seems very promising.

83
0:06:44.800 --> 0:06:53.280
Again 25.0 it's a little alpha but does the job.

84
0:06:53.280 --> 0:06:58.000
That's about it I'm really under time aren't I?

85
0:06:58.000 --> 0:07:05.040
So yeah you can find out more about our Markdown there Tiki25 which I could go on to.

86
0:07:05.040 --> 0:07:08.760
We have a lot of new stuff in there.

87
0:07:08.760 --> 0:07:17.800
You can play with it on demo.tiki.org and a recap of everything on our wiki page.

88
0:07:17.800 --> 0:07:27.240
I just wanted to say thanks to Mark Laporte who was Tiki leader for a long time and is

89
0:07:27.240 --> 0:07:34.360
still looking after us and he's sort of spearheaded this initiative.

90
0:07:34.360 --> 0:07:37.480
Markdown WYSIWYG editor who did a lot of the backend coding.

91
0:07:37.480 --> 0:07:44.960
I have a MOBA group who initiated the whole thing because they wanted better WYSIWYG and

92
0:07:44.960 --> 0:07:50.640
some mysterious third anonymous benefactor.

93
0:07:50.640 --> 0:07:53.960
That's about it.

94
0:07:53.960 --> 0:07:56.960
Are there any questions?

95
0:07:56.960 --> 0:08:14.640
We have some nice reports that you are most welcome and we have I believe 16 minutes.

96
0:08:14.640 --> 0:08:18.120
16 minutes yeah I should have done more slides.

97
0:08:18.120 --> 0:08:31.080
Yes, yes we have.

98
0:08:31.080 --> 0:08:39.240
So the question was can we can we convert from Tiki Markdown into Markdown Tiki syntax

99
0:08:39.240 --> 0:08:40.920
into Markdown and back again.

100
0:08:40.920 --> 0:08:42.120
Yes we can.

101
0:08:42.120 --> 0:08:46.640
The more you do it the more the page will go weird because there are some things that

102
0:08:46.640 --> 0:08:52.600
are supported in different ways in the different languages but yeah each wiki page has a little

103
0:08:52.600 --> 0:08:59.240
cog icon you get a little dialogue saying do you want it in WYSIWYG or plain editor

104
0:08:59.240 --> 0:09:04.240
and you want it in Tiki or Markdown syntax and it's surprising we weren't expecting

105
0:09:04.240 --> 0:09:05.720
that for Tiki 25.

106
0:09:05.720 --> 0:09:09.640
We're quite pleased that's working already.

107
0:09:09.640 --> 0:09:12.640
Again that will improve.

108
0:09:12.640 --> 0:09:22.600
Yes sir I looked at the common mark specification and basically lacks things which I used from

109
0:09:22.600 --> 0:09:27.600
PHP Markdown extra like tables definition list.

110
0:09:27.600 --> 0:09:33.040
Is there any current Markdown which implements those?

111
0:09:33.040 --> 0:09:40.320
Yes GitHub flavored Markdown sorry yeah repeat the question repeat the question.

112
0:09:40.320 --> 0:09:48.400
So specifically you're asking about tables and other features whether those are supported

113
0:09:48.400 --> 0:09:57.920
in Markdown they're not in the core common mark specification but GitHub flavored Markdown

114
0:09:57.920 --> 0:10:02.240
adds tables and a bunch of other things.

115
0:10:02.240 --> 0:10:08.320
Some things that GitHub do like references to other commits and pull requests and so

116
0:10:08.320 --> 0:10:11.440
on we don't use.

117
0:10:11.440 --> 0:10:18.240
Again Tiki flavored Markdown has our plug-in system so there's another 250 so you can do

118
0:10:18.240 --> 0:10:23.760
search results you can build quite complicated applications.

119
0:10:23.760 --> 0:10:30.800
We're still working out what's missing so I guess we'll get feedback over the next few

120
0:10:30.800 --> 0:10:35.560
months as to what people want to do and still can't.

121
0:10:35.560 --> 0:10:38.560
Yes sir.

122
0:10:38.560 --> 0:10:42.560
First one remark if people are interested we have a converter in XWixi with XWixi rendering

123
0:10:42.560 --> 0:10:46.560
supports many many syntaxes and is able to convert from one to another including from

124
0:10:46.560 --> 0:10:50.560
HTML so if you can convert something to HTML you could actually convert it to any of the

125
0:10:50.560 --> 0:10:57.560
syntaxes that XWixi rendering supports including Markdown common Markdown, GitHub, and many other

126
0:10:57.560 --> 0:10:59.560
like Tiki etc.

127
0:10:59.560 --> 0:11:06.560
I have a question on the did you have a problem for the WYSIWYG with the allowance to do inline

128
0:11:06.560 --> 0:11:15.560
HTML in Markdown to make WYSIWYG go back and forth to come back to the Markdown syntax?

129
0:11:15.560 --> 0:11:22.800
Yes in the Alpha sorry yeah did we have a problem converting from one syntax to the

130
0:11:22.800 --> 0:11:29.320
other where you get little stray bits of HTML creeping into the wiki markup which we obviously

131
0:11:29.320 --> 0:11:32.240
sanitize afterwards.

132
0:11:32.240 --> 0:11:37.800
I think we've nailed all those yes there were some challenges with that in the Alpha stages

133
0:11:37.800 --> 0:11:45.520
and I kept on finding that a bold Markdown tag would then suddenly appear as little HTML

134
0:11:45.520 --> 0:11:48.000
bold tags.

135
0:11:48.000 --> 0:11:53.440
Part of that I think is Toast does some of that.

136
0:11:53.440 --> 0:12:01.880
Then it's the initial release and it's still marked as experimental so yeah I found I don't

137
0:12:01.880 --> 0:12:08.200
know yeah I found Toast community to be a little bit sort of read-only.

138
0:12:08.200 --> 0:12:13.760
I haven't found much of a chat if anyone knows where to talk to the Toast developers better

139
0:12:13.760 --> 0:12:21.440
then I would like to do that and I did the Toast implementation but yes it's something

140
0:12:21.440 --> 0:12:25.840
we're watching out for.

141
0:12:25.840 --> 0:12:26.840
Yes Sean?

142
0:12:26.840 --> 0:12:34.840
The nice thing with common Mark is that there is an advert for public specification with

143
0:12:34.840 --> 0:12:37.840
tests and all that which is quite tough.

144
0:12:37.840 --> 0:12:38.840
Is that all leaving?

145
0:12:38.840 --> 0:12:39.840
Are we?

146
0:12:39.840 --> 0:12:40.840
Is it possible that there will be a version 2?

147
0:12:40.840 --> 0:12:53.960
Because we can't be the only people wanting to add good lists and tables.

148
0:12:53.960 --> 0:13:00.840
Yeah the question was is there going to be a common Mark version 2?

149
0:13:00.840 --> 0:13:04.760
I don't know anyone else got any ideas?

150
0:13:04.760 --> 0:13:10.000
It seems to be is designed to be very complete and it's designed to be very simple so possibly

151
0:13:10.000 --> 0:13:17.040
not I guess we have to wait and see.

152
0:13:17.040 --> 0:13:23.520
As an aside I found out the MIDI you know the music interface system that is still version

153
0:13:23.520 --> 0:13:30.480
1.0 and that started in the 80s so maybe it doesn't need upgrading.

154
0:13:30.480 --> 0:13:32.480
Hello.

155
0:13:32.480 --> 0:13:47.560
I'm just now playing around with myself generating HTML from Markdown.

156
0:13:47.560 --> 0:13:54.040
I was wondering if you have any advice on how to go about it, what tools you can find

157
0:13:54.040 --> 0:13:55.040
yourself.

158
0:13:55.040 --> 0:13:56.320
Depends which language you're writing it in.

159
0:13:56.320 --> 0:13:58.320
Oh yeah sorry.

160
0:13:58.320 --> 0:14:06.280
Are there any tools and libraries you're asking to convert Markdown to HTML?

161
0:14:06.280 --> 0:14:08.720
Yes there's a lot.

162
0:14:08.720 --> 0:14:17.760
We're using the PHP League, common Mark because we're a PHP application, which does most of

163
0:14:17.760 --> 0:14:24.640
the Markdown to HTML conversion and I believe the HTML back to Markdown because again we

164
0:14:24.640 --> 0:14:30.640
go via HTML when we're doing conversion process.

165
0:14:30.640 --> 0:14:32.640
Which language are you in?

166
0:14:32.640 --> 0:14:37.640
I think for me it would be Python.

167
0:14:37.640 --> 0:14:39.520
They're bound to be surely.

168
0:14:39.520 --> 0:14:48.040
I don't know the Python world that well so I'm guessing there'd be a link on probably

169
0:14:48.040 --> 0:14:55.280
on the common Mark website, commonmark.org, you should have a list of all of the libraries

170
0:14:55.280 --> 0:14:57.280
and implementations.

171
0:14:57.280 --> 0:15:11.200
Okay so spend the rest of the half hour as you wish unless there's any more questions.

172
0:15:11.200 --> 0:15:12.200
I'll leave it to it.

173
0:15:12.200 --> 0:15:13.200
Thank you.

174
0:15:13.200 --> 0:15:14.200
Thank you.
