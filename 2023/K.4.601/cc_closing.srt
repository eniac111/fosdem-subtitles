0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.880
All right. So people, thank you all for being here. We're not going to keep it long. Maybe

2
0:00:12.880 --> 0:00:16.800
just a couple of words to wrap up. This was the fourth edition, and we are very happy

3
0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:24.320
that it was again physically. It's a hugely different experience. And I think we are doing

4
0:00:24.320 --> 0:00:28.160
very well as a community, as an open source community on just execution. I think we are

5
0:00:28.160 --> 0:00:34.080
doing well, and that's something to celebrate together. There's only two things you can do

6
0:00:34.080 --> 0:00:38.960
with computing. One is to restrict the user to things like digital restrictions management,

7
0:00:38.960 --> 0:00:45.200
DRM, and the other I think, and that's the future, is how can we secure user data. And

8
0:00:45.200 --> 0:00:51.200
to do that, I think the only way forward is open source and free software. So let's keep

9
0:00:51.200 --> 0:00:55.960
the pace up together as a community, and hopefully we gather again here in Brussels next year.

10
0:00:55.960 --> 0:01:02.080
And I think Fitz also wants to say something. Yeah, I just want to wrap up and saying thank

11
0:01:02.080 --> 0:01:06.560
you to everyone to join. Thank you for the nice questions. I think it was nicer than

12
0:01:06.560 --> 0:01:13.160
the last years. Please send us feedback. Send us words about what you think about also the

13
0:01:13.160 --> 0:01:17.080
online part of it, because we're not sure if we want to keep this hybrid version of

14
0:01:17.080 --> 0:01:21.040
it for the next year. So please send us any thoughts of whether you think the online part

15
0:01:21.040 --> 0:01:25.040
was actually worthwhile. I think this part will always be livestreamed by FOSDEM, but

16
0:01:25.040 --> 0:01:28.640
we're not sure whether we actually keep it in hybrid. So please send us any thoughts

17
0:01:28.640 --> 0:01:33.800
you have, and please also reach out to us if you want changes made for next year's.

18
0:01:33.800 --> 0:01:38.680
We really want to make this more of a community event, and maybe also get a full day next

19
0:01:38.680 --> 0:01:42.120
year. So thank you a lot to everyone, and have a great evening. Thank you for being

20
0:01:42.120 --> 0:02:05.240
here.
