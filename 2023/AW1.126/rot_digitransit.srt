1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:24.360
So to have enough time for our last routing specialist now from Finland, we would start

2
0:00:24.360 --> 0:00:25.760
on time.

3
0:00:25.760 --> 0:00:26.760
Yes.

4
0:00:26.760 --> 0:00:32.200
Please, no, it's not working because it's for the camera.

5
0:00:32.200 --> 0:00:36.280
I'm screaming because we don't have an audience here.

6
0:00:36.280 --> 0:00:39.120
Yeah, it's not a microphone.

7
0:00:39.120 --> 0:00:44.400
But let's welcome our last speaker from Finland.

8
0:00:44.400 --> 0:00:45.680
It's Gerald Lapallain.

9
0:00:45.680 --> 0:00:48.160
I hope I speak your name well.

10
0:00:48.160 --> 0:00:50.360
And yeah, we are really glad to have you with us.

11
0:00:50.360 --> 0:00:56.320
Introducing Diki Transits to us from Finland, we expect a lot because you are already known

12
0:00:56.320 --> 0:00:58.360
for great mobility solutions.

13
0:00:58.360 --> 0:01:04.240
And yeah, let's give him the chance to explain Diki Transits to us and highlight the really

14
0:01:04.240 --> 0:01:05.640
interesting components.

15
0:01:05.640 --> 0:01:06.640
Thank you, Gerald.

16
0:01:06.640 --> 0:01:26.880
Okay.

17
0:01:26.880 --> 0:01:31.320
Hello.

18
0:01:31.320 --> 0:01:33.800
Hopefully you can hear me well.

19
0:01:33.800 --> 0:01:35.240
My name is Gerald Lapallain.

20
0:01:35.240 --> 0:01:40.880
I'm from Finland, a set, and I work as a developer on the open trip planner and the Diki Transit

21
0:01:40.880 --> 0:01:41.880
projects.

22
0:01:41.880 --> 0:01:45.640
And today I'm here to talk about the Diki Transit project.

23
0:01:45.640 --> 0:01:47.600
So what is Diki Transit?

24
0:01:47.600 --> 0:01:55.080
It's an open source project that does multi-modal public transportation journey planning.

25
0:01:55.080 --> 0:01:59.200
It was founded in Finland around 2014 or 15.

26
0:01:59.200 --> 0:02:04.520
I have personally been working on the project since 2017.

27
0:02:04.520 --> 0:02:10.320
The goal of the project was to replace existing legacy propriety journey planners.

28
0:02:10.320 --> 0:02:17.600
And the project is funded by three transportation authorities or sort of authorities in Finland.

29
0:02:17.600 --> 0:02:22.200
The project has, or the components of the projects have since been used elsewhere, for

30
0:02:22.200 --> 0:02:25.120
example, in Germany.

31
0:02:25.120 --> 0:02:32.240
The project consists of user interfaces, which I'm going to talk more about in this presentation,

32
0:02:32.240 --> 0:02:35.800
Open Packend Services and Open APIs.

33
0:02:35.800 --> 0:02:39.840
So first, a bit about the pack and services.

34
0:02:39.840 --> 0:02:44.640
So for routing and much more, we are using open trip planner.

35
0:02:44.640 --> 0:02:47.000
Hans will have a presentation next about open trip planners.

36
0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:50.560
I'm not going to go too much into it now.

37
0:02:50.560 --> 0:02:56.040
For geocoding, we are using Pelya's that we have further improved.

38
0:02:56.040 --> 0:03:00.440
So it deals with GTFS data and so on.

39
0:03:00.440 --> 0:03:06.600
And for maps, we are using this project called HSL map server, which uses dialogue GL and

40
0:03:06.600 --> 0:03:08.640
OpenStreetMap.

41
0:03:08.640 --> 0:03:13.360
And we also use OpenStreetMap for the geocoding as well.

42
0:03:13.360 --> 0:03:15.440
So now for the user interfaces.

43
0:03:15.440 --> 0:03:20.520
So first, this is the digit transit user interface.

44
0:03:20.520 --> 0:03:25.080
It's written in JavaScript and uses React.

45
0:03:25.080 --> 0:03:27.040
It's responsive.

46
0:03:27.040 --> 0:03:30.200
Most of our users are on mobile devices.

47
0:03:30.200 --> 0:03:40.920
It's browser based and it's also meant to be so you can use it with screen readers and

48
0:03:40.920 --> 0:03:44.520
so on.

49
0:03:44.520 --> 0:03:45.520
It's configurable.

50
0:03:45.520 --> 0:03:47.680
You can have different themes.

51
0:03:47.680 --> 0:03:52.120
My screenshots will be from different sites, so they will have different configurations

52
0:03:52.120 --> 0:03:53.760
and themes.

53
0:03:53.760 --> 0:03:56.600
So this is the front page on desktop.

54
0:03:56.600 --> 0:03:58.960
Here you can start the it in a research.

55
0:03:58.960 --> 0:04:04.040
You can enter origin and destination, which can be like addresses or stops or whatever.

56
0:04:04.040 --> 0:04:08.240
And you can add some favorites or use favorites for locations.

57
0:04:08.240 --> 0:04:11.080
And then you can enter these stops near you pages.

58
0:04:11.080 --> 0:04:14.240
I will display later on what this means.

59
0:04:14.240 --> 0:04:21.360
And then you have this search box for stops and routes and bike rental station and bike

60
0:04:21.360 --> 0:04:23.160
and car parks and so on.

61
0:04:23.160 --> 0:04:28.400
I won't show those views now because the time is a bit limited.

62
0:04:28.400 --> 0:04:31.680
And on the map, if I would have tuned in a bit more, there would have been more.

63
0:04:31.680 --> 0:04:36.560
So now it's just showing some stations.

64
0:04:36.560 --> 0:04:40.920
So these are the itineraries on mobile.

65
0:04:40.920 --> 0:04:47.080
The view on the left, it's showing the summary of the found results.

66
0:04:47.080 --> 0:04:51.560
It's showing multiple itineraries in this view and just like a summary of those.

67
0:04:51.560 --> 0:04:55.560
The length of the legs is based on the duration of the leg.

68
0:04:55.560 --> 0:04:58.480
And that's like we support real time data.

69
0:04:58.480 --> 0:05:02.240
So those three numbers are real time estimates.

70
0:05:02.240 --> 0:05:04.000
And this is more the model.

71
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:09.200
So in this such instance, there's buses, trains, metros, walking.

72
0:05:09.200 --> 0:05:11.040
There could be bike rental.

73
0:05:11.040 --> 0:05:16.880
And then we have like this model also speed into separate such as this on the top.

74
0:05:16.880 --> 0:05:17.880
There's like cycling.

75
0:05:17.880 --> 0:05:23.560
There could be just walking, combining cycling with public transportation or combining cars

76
0:05:23.560 --> 0:05:26.360
with public transportation.

77
0:05:26.360 --> 0:05:31.080
And on the right, the view is shown when you click open some such as then.

78
0:05:31.080 --> 0:05:33.760
It shows more details about the such as then.

79
0:05:33.760 --> 0:05:35.200
And it shows the map.

80
0:05:35.200 --> 0:05:40.560
If the trip was happening right now, we could display the relevant vehicle on map for the

81
0:05:40.560 --> 0:05:42.760
such as thens.

82
0:05:42.760 --> 0:05:48.360
And yeah, there's more details here.

83
0:05:48.360 --> 0:05:52.560
This view is the stop near you page that I mentioned earlier.

84
0:05:52.560 --> 0:05:58.120
So we did some design and discussed with real users.

85
0:05:58.120 --> 0:06:00.560
And they found this view to be useful.

86
0:06:00.560 --> 0:06:03.560
So we have split this into like different modes.

87
0:06:03.560 --> 0:06:06.520
It shows the next departures for buses in this view.

88
0:06:06.520 --> 0:06:12.200
But there's another view that shows for trains or metro or whatever is available in the city.

89
0:06:12.200 --> 0:06:20.200
And there's also one view that shows the departures for your ferret stops.

90
0:06:20.200 --> 0:06:25.360
And these stops are the stops that are near you or select a location.

91
0:06:25.360 --> 0:06:30.480
And on the map, it will show the vehicles that travel through the stops and also the

92
0:06:30.480 --> 0:06:37.160
bus lines.

93
0:06:37.160 --> 0:06:42.560
So here's an example how this digit transit UI can be integrated into different website.

94
0:06:42.560 --> 0:06:46.600
This is the front page for the Helsinki Regional Transportation Authority.

95
0:06:46.600 --> 0:06:50.960
On the left side, we have the same components we had in the front page from the digit transit

96
0:06:50.960 --> 0:06:52.000
UI.

97
0:06:52.000 --> 0:06:55.400
This is done through shared components.

98
0:06:55.400 --> 0:06:57.740
So this only acts like an entry point.

99
0:06:57.740 --> 0:07:06.040
So once user does select locations here, he or she will be redirected into the digit transit

100
0:07:06.040 --> 0:07:10.860
user interface.

101
0:07:10.860 --> 0:07:14.900
And here's another example how digit transit UI can be integrated.

102
0:07:14.900 --> 0:07:18.760
This is done through an iframe widget.

103
0:07:18.760 --> 0:07:24.320
There's a view which can be used to generate this iframe snippets.

104
0:07:24.320 --> 0:07:29.320
And this is for like general routing, but it's also possible to have only like this

105
0:07:29.320 --> 0:07:31.240
for like walking or cycling.

106
0:07:31.240 --> 0:07:39.040
So the user will be redirected to the correct view.

107
0:07:39.040 --> 0:07:42.640
This is another project, another user interface.

108
0:07:42.640 --> 0:07:47.800
Previously, we called it virtual monitor, but it's now, now there's more called stop

109
0:07:47.800 --> 0:07:50.720
monitor, which kind of describes it better.

110
0:07:50.720 --> 0:07:58.520
So this stop monitor is meant for like businesses or private persons or public transportation

111
0:07:58.520 --> 0:07:59.520
authorities.

112
0:07:59.520 --> 0:08:06.160
So they can have the screen somewhere which displays the departures for the stops near

113
0:08:06.160 --> 0:08:07.760
that location.

114
0:08:07.760 --> 0:08:13.080
So this view is for, I should also mention that this is written with TypeScript and also

115
0:08:13.080 --> 0:08:15.200
used Vect.

116
0:08:15.200 --> 0:08:21.200
This view is for generating this view, the stop monitor view.

117
0:08:21.200 --> 0:08:25.880
In this you can have multiple stops on the same view, and you can have multiple views

118
0:08:25.880 --> 0:08:28.880
that can rotate based on some time frames.

119
0:08:28.880 --> 0:08:33.400
So for every five seconds it will change which view is shown.

120
0:08:33.400 --> 0:08:39.280
And there's many options for layouts here.

121
0:08:39.280 --> 0:08:41.200
Here is just an example entry result.

122
0:08:41.200 --> 0:08:46.640
You can have like this speed view where there's departures on the left and on the right.

123
0:08:46.640 --> 0:08:48.960
This is for airport.

124
0:08:48.960 --> 0:08:53.400
And on the bottom there's relevant alerts for that stop.

125
0:08:53.400 --> 0:08:55.760
And this stop can be modified later on.

126
0:08:55.760 --> 0:08:58.800
So once you have created this, it's not really final.

127
0:08:58.800 --> 0:09:04.520
You can still do modifications.

128
0:09:04.520 --> 0:09:09.040
So what's next in the Digi-Trent project?

129
0:09:09.040 --> 0:09:13.560
We started the project so early on that OpenTree Planner only had version one out.

130
0:09:13.560 --> 0:09:18.000
So we are currently working on improve the support for using OpenTree Planner version

131
0:09:18.000 --> 0:09:19.000
two.

132
0:09:19.000 --> 0:09:22.200
It's already working, but there's some optimizations that can be done.

133
0:09:22.200 --> 0:09:27.880
So the Digi-Trent UI that I showed, it's like version two, and we have version three that

134
0:09:27.880 --> 0:09:31.480
is better optimized for using OpenTree Planner two.

135
0:09:31.480 --> 0:09:36.560
And then we will have a possibility to have a map view on the stop monitor so you can

136
0:09:36.560 --> 0:09:43.520
have display the vehicles that are going to the stop so the user can see, okay, this vehicle

137
0:09:43.520 --> 0:09:44.520
is going here.

138
0:09:44.520 --> 0:09:48.040
Maybe I should start going to the stop.

139
0:09:48.040 --> 0:09:51.880
And then we will improve the support for first and last one services.

140
0:09:51.880 --> 0:09:57.440
So we have already been supporting like bike rental stations and in Germany they have added

141
0:09:57.440 --> 0:10:02.680
support for like scooter rentals, like floating vehicles.

142
0:10:02.680 --> 0:10:07.400
And we will also focus more on like flexible public transportation.

143
0:10:07.400 --> 0:10:12.200
So there's many types of services like that.

144
0:10:12.200 --> 0:10:17.920
And this can include like taxis or stuff like that.

145
0:10:17.920 --> 0:10:23.680
So for more information, you're going to visit digi-trent.fi, which contains some documentation

146
0:10:23.680 --> 0:10:32.000
relevant to the project and the repositories are hosted under this HSL development community

147
0:10:32.000 --> 0:10:33.640
GitHub account.

148
0:10:33.640 --> 0:10:38.480
There's many projects there, some are not Digi-Trent projects, but if you search for

149
0:10:38.480 --> 0:10:41.920
Digi-Trent projects, you will find the relevant ones.

150
0:10:41.920 --> 0:10:49.320
And we have this email address, digi-trent.fi, which if you send message there, I will get

151
0:10:49.320 --> 0:10:51.920
the message.

152
0:10:51.920 --> 0:10:53.600
So thank you, that was the presentation.

153
0:10:53.600 --> 0:10:57.160
Now it's time for questions if you have any.

154
0:10:57.160 --> 0:10:58.160
Yes.

155
0:10:58.160 --> 0:10:59.160
Yes.

156
0:10:59.160 --> 0:11:07.240
For me, it's interesting for your country that I would like to have this kind of information

157
0:11:07.240 --> 0:11:10.240
for Europe, European community first.

158
0:11:10.240 --> 0:11:16.240
And it would be interesting to have the best range to reach a place everywhere in Europe.

159
0:11:16.240 --> 0:11:19.240
And it's not easy for the moment.

160
0:11:19.240 --> 0:11:22.520
You have only national lines.

161
0:11:22.520 --> 0:11:29.760
And so I remember it was 20 years ago when it was SIPRA with regional trains in Germany,

162
0:11:29.760 --> 0:11:33.320
but there was low and high problem with that.

163
0:11:33.320 --> 0:11:41.400
Also I know also to go from Brussels to Firebook in Bridesville in Germany, it was SIPRA by

164
0:11:41.400 --> 0:11:44.480
the train in Germany and so on.

165
0:11:44.480 --> 0:11:50.400
So all this kind of information and you plan to have to extend your project to the European

166
0:11:50.400 --> 0:11:52.520
planet?

167
0:11:52.520 --> 0:11:57.840
So we might expand it to include Estonia for this Finnish project.

168
0:11:57.840 --> 0:12:03.480
There's still some issues with scaling this because if you're using multi-criteria search,

169
0:12:03.480 --> 0:12:09.200
it doesn't scale to this continental scale yet on the machines we are running on.

170
0:12:09.200 --> 0:12:15.200
So there's some optimizations needed to get it work.

171
0:12:15.200 --> 0:12:16.200
Yep.

172
0:12:16.200 --> 0:12:26.200
Are you working on integrating ticketing so you can also buy in your app, the ticket and

173
0:12:26.200 --> 0:12:29.200
APIs on discovering the ticket price?

174
0:12:29.200 --> 0:12:33.680
This might be included in the first and last mile services.

175
0:12:33.680 --> 0:12:35.480
I'm not quite sure on the details yet.

176
0:12:35.480 --> 0:12:40.480
We are still on the design phase on what we will support, but that is an idea that we

177
0:12:40.480 --> 0:12:42.480
have discussed previously.

178
