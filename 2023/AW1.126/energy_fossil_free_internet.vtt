WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.560
Okay, shall I start folks?

00:07.560 --> 00:11.220
I'm afraid I have quite a few slides to go through folks.

00:11.220 --> 00:15.080
So if you, I guess I'll start now then.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.580
Hello folks, welcome to my talk, Getting to a Fossil Free Internet by 2030, before I start.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.280
Can you folks hear me alright?

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
Excellent.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.660
Okay, alright.

00:24.660 --> 00:29.440
As you can see, there's the title, a tour of the tech and policy changes to get us there.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.400
Hello, if you can't see my face here, because you're not in this room, that's what I look

00:34.400 --> 00:35.400
like I suppose.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.440
My name is Chris, I work at an organisation called the Green Web Foundation.

00:40.440 --> 00:46.000
I've spent the last 10 to 15 years working in a series of wacky climate and data themed

00:46.000 --> 00:47.960
start-ups as you can see here.

00:47.960 --> 00:53.360
Loco2 is about locomotion like trains, but also low CO2 and going loco, because you don't

00:53.360 --> 00:55.120
go on holiday, so stuff like that.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.420
And it's just a panzeric thing that I have been working with.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.520
So these days I do most of my time working with the Green Web Foundation.

01:02.520 --> 01:06.080
So we track the transition of the internet away from fossil fuels.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.020
I also run a podcast where I talk all about green software with other people.

01:10.020 --> 01:15.120
And I also work with a larger organisation called the Green Software Foundation, where

01:15.120 --> 01:17.800
we do work on policy specifically.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.440
During the time I have with you today, we're going to cover these three things here.

01:21.440 --> 01:25.920
I'm going to tell you about why I care about a fossil free internet by 2030.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.360
I'm going to share a framework for helping you think about sustainability in the digital

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
realm.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.900
And then I'm going to use this framework to look ahead at some policy and tech changes.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.020
So let's start.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.620
Why a fossil free internet by 2030?

01:41.620 --> 01:45.960
So the main one, it's like, let's be real clear about this.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.600
We're in a climate crisis because we keep burning fossil fuels.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.660
Every single time over the last 30 years, we've had a chance to get off them.

01:52.660 --> 01:53.760
We haven't.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.520
If you want to actually speak to your friends or your boss about why a fossil free internet

01:58.520 --> 02:02.700
is important, these are the ways I think you might explain it to someone.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.320
So first of all, it's achievable.

02:05.320 --> 02:09.600
There are big firms already doing this, but we'll see that small firms can do this, like

02:09.600 --> 02:11.480
climate emergency, carbon savings.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.680
That's another one.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.800
It saves lives because all the kind of stuff that gets put into the sky that it doesn't

02:17.800 --> 02:21.200
heat the world up ends up poisoning lots and lots of people.

02:21.200 --> 02:25.280
That saves money because, as we know, fossil fuels are not cheap if you try heating your

02:25.280 --> 02:26.640
house recently.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.800
And yeah, people like being in green firms.

02:28.800 --> 02:32.840
And yeah, there's a whole geopolitics thing that I think people in Ukraine will be very

02:32.840 --> 02:33.840
aware of.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.600
And as Germans, we also, or as people, Europeans, we're aware of too.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.760
So that's why I'd stay there.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.940
Now a framework to think about this is what we use where I work.

02:43.940 --> 02:49.720
We have a model that we call CID, consumption, intensity and direction, where consumption

02:49.720 --> 02:52.800
is about can I change how much we need.

02:52.800 --> 02:57.280
Intensity is can I change how much harm is done by the things that we have to do.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.760
And direction is about changing where do we want to go, what kind of future do we want

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
to build.

03:01.760 --> 03:08.000
So the first of these is the lenses is consumption, because our society is largely still based

03:08.000 --> 03:13.620
on fossil fuels, using pretty much resources in any way, or create some form of carbon

03:13.620 --> 03:15.240
pollution and waste.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.040
And to start off with, if there are things that we want to do, it's a good idea to try

03:19.040 --> 03:23.320
to minimize the amount of resources we need to do that, no matter what.

03:23.320 --> 03:28.860
So with that in mind, we know that we should be really reducing this, reducing emissions.

03:28.860 --> 03:32.400
What do the trends look like for the last year, right?

03:32.400 --> 03:41.320
This is a chart of historical CO2 emissions created by Dr. Robert Rode at Berkeley Earth,

03:41.320 --> 03:44.560
a kind of environmental data science nonprofit.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.800
You can see your direction we're heading in.

03:46.800 --> 03:53.120
And the good news is that in 2015, almost every single country on Earth agreed at COP

03:53.120 --> 03:57.560
21, a climate conference, that we really should aim to reduce emissions.

03:57.560 --> 04:02.120
And we should go for well below two degrees of warming for this century.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.440
Since then, we've actually found out that we need to be aiming for not just well below

04:05.440 --> 04:12.320
two degrees, but more like well below 1.5 degrees, which is a much more aggressive target.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.600
And that's what you can see.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.920
These are the potential pathways we should be on.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.760
And what does that mean for our sector, the tech sector?

04:19.760 --> 04:24.080
Well, the Paris Agreement will require for the information and communication technology

04:24.080 --> 04:29.400
industry to reduce greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.920
So that's about 7% year on year if we started in 2020.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.160
And I'm not sure it went down the last three years.

04:38.160 --> 04:42.560
So this was actually something that was put together by the Science-Based Targets Institute.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.280
The ITU, which is the International Telecoms Union, I think, and a number of other kind

04:47.280 --> 04:51.040
of official organizations who spent a decent amount of time looking at this.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.360
And this is just for two degrees.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.640
So we need to be doing more than 45%, really.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.560
So how are we doing so far?

04:57.560 --> 05:01.520
Well, there's good news and there's bad news, I suppose.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.600
So the good news is that like two billion people have been connected to the internet

05:05.600 --> 05:07.440
in the last, say, five or six years.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.680
And we've been able to use the internet a lot more, which during the pandemic was very,

05:11.680 --> 05:12.680
very useful.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.640
I really appreciated having access to the internet during the pandemic.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.840
And what I want to draw your attention to here is that while we've increased usage of

05:21.840 --> 05:28.760
digital services, we haven't necessarily increased the usage of energy at the same kind of proportion,

05:28.760 --> 05:34.200
except for cryptocurrencies, which, to be honest, the less said about that, the better.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.320
So I'm not going to really be talking about that too much if that's OK with you folks.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.440
However, and I should ask, why have the figures not been higher?

05:42.440 --> 05:46.840
Well, the simplest answer is that Moore's law has been helping us.

05:46.840 --> 05:51.400
And Moore's law is basically where computer chips have been getting steadily faster and

05:51.400 --> 05:53.480
more power efficient over time.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.800
And as the sector has grown so fast, the average efficiency has increased.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.200
So the thing is, Moore's law is not infinite.

06:01.200 --> 06:06.000
So going forward, improvements in efficiency will likely have to come from new places,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.960
not just the chips themselves.

06:07.960 --> 06:12.040
And this is what this diagram from a paper in Science magazine illustrates.

06:12.040 --> 06:17.120
This paper is called There's Plenty of Room at the Top, What Will Drive Computer Performance

06:17.120 --> 06:18.460
After Moore's Law.

06:18.460 --> 06:19.640
It's a fun read.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.520
And the general argument is that for efficiency gains to keep up with, or keep pace with growth

06:24.520 --> 06:29.000
and really need to be going faster than growth so we don't just stay flat, but actually go

06:29.000 --> 06:33.480
down, we'll need to start applying all these ideas at the top.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
All right.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.600
So that directly means it's going to land on us as developers and designers of digital

06:38.600 --> 06:41.000
services a lot more than it otherwise would have.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.560
We can't just rely on Moore's law doing the work for us.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.100
So that's consumption.

06:47.100 --> 06:53.560
And as Phil Griffiths, the author of Electrify, says, you can't efficiency your way to zero.

06:53.560 --> 06:58.280
If we don't want to be cold and wet and without Wi-Fi, at some point there will be a minimal

06:58.280 --> 07:00.800
amount of resource usage that takes place.

07:00.800 --> 07:05.240
Based with that, we need to think about the harm that occurs as a byproduct for every

07:05.240 --> 07:08.460
unit of usage that we have to make.

07:08.460 --> 07:13.840
So in our framework, we talk about this in terms of intensity because there are multiple

07:13.840 --> 07:20.920
dimensions of intensity from water usage to resource depletion to soil toxicity, air quality.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.040
But for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to focus primarily on carbon pollution.

07:26.040 --> 07:32.880
Now in Germany, where I live, the carbon intensity of electricity is influenced by two main things.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.440
There's a lot of wind and solar for sure.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.120
But there's also the majority of our power comes from burning coal.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.240
And these machines, that's what's powering our data centers.

07:42.240 --> 07:47.840
These machines you can see, they destroy forests, they destroy people's homes just to dig up

07:47.840 --> 07:51.480
coal, which we then burn to heat up water to create steam.

07:51.480 --> 07:56.000
The steam turns a turbine, which generates electricity, which is what we end up using.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.600
Along the way, we lose about two thirds of all the energy through cooling towers, and

08:00.600 --> 08:02.280
we emit a lot of carbon.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.080
So a kilowatt of hour of power is around like a kilogram of CO2.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.080
This isn't the only way.

08:09.080 --> 08:14.320
An alternative approach would be to directly harness the energy around us using either

08:14.320 --> 08:18.320
solar or wind turbines, geothermal and so on.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.640
Now we're not burning fuels in this case.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.520
So we're no longer wasting lots of energy in the form of waste heat that we need to

08:23.520 --> 08:25.680
put into the sky.

08:25.680 --> 08:29.120
And it means that there's no need for the kinds of cooling towers that you frequently

08:29.120 --> 08:30.120
see.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.240
So it looks somewhat different as well.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.840
Also the carbon emissions are much, much, much lower.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.880
Even when you factor in the actual making of the solar panels and disposing of them,

08:38.880 --> 08:44.720
for example, you can see the figure here, it's something like 17 times lower.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.120
So this is why it makes sense to not be running on fossil fuels.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.920
Now globally speaking, about 60% of the electricity we use right now comes from burning fossil

08:52.920 --> 08:53.920
fuels.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.680
So it's a global average in certain parts of the world.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.960
Energy is much cleaner.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.400
In other parts it's much dirtier.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.080
The numbers look tiny on this part.

09:02.080 --> 09:06.960
What you can see is that wind and solar in the top right are growing and they've really

09:06.960 --> 09:10.920
been plummeting in cost over the last 10 years.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
Solar energy is nearly 10 times cheaper than it was 10 years ago.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.760
And something like 90% of all the new energy capacity that comes on stream these days is

09:19.760 --> 09:21.360
coming from renewables.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.880
So there is some hope.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.320
It's not just going to be that awful black line forever.

09:26.320 --> 09:32.280
So because the carbon intensive compute is not uniform, like I said, all around the world,

09:32.280 --> 09:37.680
if you want to reduce the harm done by carbon pollution from the energy usage that powers

09:37.680 --> 09:42.200
your servers or powers any digital services, you have two main options.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.360
You can move work geographically to run things where the energy is cleaner.

09:46.360 --> 09:48.760
So this is like geographic migration.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.160
That's like the Iceland, the Nordics and so on.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.480
But because the energy, the carbon intensity of energy changes based on how much, where

09:56.480 --> 10:00.760
the generation is coming from, you can basically move things through time.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.840
So you can wait to run things at a different time of day, for example.

10:04.840 --> 10:10.520
So you can wait till it's windy or sunny or send it to where it's windy or sunny.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.280
So that's consumption, intensity and direction.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.560
Finally we have direction.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.280
If you care about open source technology and free software, you know, they're very important

10:18.280 --> 10:21.800
ideas that are kind of re-embed into free software.

10:21.800 --> 10:26.040
And this is like you choosing to work on one project over another, you're making one version

10:26.040 --> 10:29.080
of the future more likely to actually happen than another.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.680
And this is the quote that I find really useful.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.360
It's from a guy called Cade DM.

10:32.360 --> 10:36.560
He says, technology is a social, political and environmental accelerant.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.040
I think it's useful because it really kind of gets across the idea that we're making

10:40.040 --> 10:43.640
a deliberate decision about what we're supporting.

10:43.640 --> 10:50.080
And to give you some idea, this is a graph showing the direct emissions from a number

10:50.080 --> 10:56.200
of companies you've heard of in 2019 plus a single contract from Microsoft with Exxon

10:56.200 --> 11:02.360
Mobile, one of the oil companies that recently, like in the last month, announced $150 billion

11:02.360 --> 11:04.280
in profit last year.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
All right.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.440
Basically the consequence of using AI to help Exxon Mobile basically drill for more oil and

11:10.440 --> 11:13.200
gas is basically around 6 million tons.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.960
So that's about a Facebook.

11:15.960 --> 11:21.080
And this is the same figure and this is actually something why I talk about actually thinking

11:21.080 --> 11:26.280
about what you use it for, not just can I make myself efficient, basically.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.600
It's not all bad again.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.920
So Microsoft, they do this, but they've recently been doing more work about actually finding

11:31.920 --> 11:36.520
ways to actually get coal fired power plants off the grid and replacing with other forms

11:36.520 --> 11:39.400
of power like geothermal or nuclear sometimes.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
All right.

11:40.400 --> 11:44.320
And every single time, that's like more than a Facebook, more than a Facebook, more than

11:44.320 --> 11:46.520
a Google is worth every single year coming down.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.160
So this is why it's important to actually be thinking about what you use it for.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.960
So let's use this framework to talk about some of the policy and tech changes ahead

11:53.960 --> 11:56.280
of us.

11:56.280 --> 12:01.360
So remember that chart that I showed you before about emissions going up when they need to

12:01.360 --> 12:03.080
be going down, right?

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
Okay.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.120
For better or worse, this idea of reducing emissions to within safe limits has started

12:08.120 --> 12:10.400
to be referred to as net zero.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.320
And we're finally starting to see some consensus about what it actually means.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.720
Now this is the ISO, the people who set standards.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.240
They've created some guidance about what net zero should really mean.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.280
And the actual guidance is pretty strident.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.720
They basically say net zero claims are no longer considered credible if they are not

12:28.720 --> 12:31.800
halving emissions by 2030 for an organization.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.520
So if your organization doesn't have a net zero target and it's not doing that, not really

12:35.520 --> 12:36.520
credible.

12:36.520 --> 12:41.240
But also say it needs to include the entire supply chain, not just like your own stuff,

12:41.240 --> 12:42.240
basically.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.240
And also you need to have interim targets.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.400
So targets for 2025 or 2026.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.040
And this is because seven years is roughly the typical kind of tenure of a CEO that you

12:52.040 --> 12:54.400
can say, well, we know it's all about 2030.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.520
Leave and then leave it for someone else's job to actually fix.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.720
And this is why it's actually quite important to actually do this because you need to have

13:00.720 --> 13:03.560
something which actually brings action early.

13:03.560 --> 13:08.880
So in Europe, the it's a bit of a mouthful, the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting

13:08.880 --> 13:11.200
Directive in 2024.

13:11.200 --> 13:16.800
That's what organizations above 250 employees now need to be reporting, which means you

13:16.800 --> 13:21.720
need to have started reporting two months ago for 2023 if you haven't already started

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
reporting.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
So this is a thing that's important.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.960
And then finally, the IFRS, they're a bit like the kind of pope of accounting standards.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.680
They basically set a decree that everyone ends up following.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.680
And they've said that, no, if you're going to talk about the carbon footprint of your

13:35.680 --> 13:39.280
organization, you need to talk about not just your organization, but you need to talk about

13:39.280 --> 13:40.760
your supply chain as well.

13:40.760 --> 13:45.720
And that's actually really important because around 90 percent plus is makes up most people's

13:45.720 --> 13:49.360
emissions in the supply chain, not really your own emissions.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.360
So let's use our framework we spoke about consumption and all that.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.680
OK, can I change how much we need?

13:55.680 --> 13:59.200
Joseph did a really good job talking about things like the Blau angle and things like

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
that.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.200
And he's now emerging standards to actually try to label sustainability of digital services.

14:05.200 --> 14:10.280
And as he mentioned, yeah, there is Ocular was the first ever product that got some decent

14:10.280 --> 14:12.720
got actually certified for this.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.640
This is important because people who spend money on digital software, like, say, public

14:17.640 --> 14:21.720
sector or large, large companies, they can they can write these into contract and say

14:21.720 --> 14:26.340
you need to have a blue angle certificate in order to actually for us to spend tens

14:26.340 --> 14:29.240
of millions of euros with you, for example.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.840
If you want to like work with this stuff yourself or work out the environmental footprint of

14:32.840 --> 14:36.560
this, we mentioned before the guy called Arna Tarrara.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.520
He actually demonstrated a really, really cool piece of technology that does this stuff.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.400
If you have a digital service, it will show you it will basically create a system so you

14:44.400 --> 14:46.960
can see this and then it will come up with all these cool charts.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.440
So you can see this is like a chart.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.960
This is the output showing me doing various things and seeing how it creates spikes in

14:52.960 --> 14:53.960
usage.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.260
So that's testing something from the outside.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.320
You can also look at something from the inside.

14:58.320 --> 15:03.120
So the Firefox profiler, that will actually self-report its own information.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.040
So it will tell you I'm using I'm using this much power and this part of my browser is

15:07.040 --> 15:08.200
using this much.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.400
That's really, really, really cool.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.280
And there's a whole talk about that later.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.880
We did some work with them to actually turn some of these into carbon metrics.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.600
So you get an idea of what these figures are from.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.080
And this is the kind of stuff that my organization tends to do.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.760
If you know this, then you can actually figure out, OK, now that I understand there are hotspots

15:25.760 --> 15:28.280
and what I'm doing, what do I do?

15:28.280 --> 15:33.000
And this chart has been shared or this table has been shared quite a few places.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.920
Basically different languages have different kind of memory footprints.

15:36.920 --> 15:41.560
And this might give you the impression that you should just rewrite everything in C or

15:41.560 --> 15:42.600
something like that.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.200
That's not the end of the message you should take away.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.200
But in many cases, it may be that there are certain parts that are already being rewritten

15:50.200 --> 15:51.240
for you.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.480
Or it's worth remembering that you might be using a language for other reasons than just

15:55.480 --> 15:56.720
efficiency.

15:56.720 --> 16:01.840
And if you are building something super efficient that help people dig for more oil and gas,

16:01.840 --> 16:04.120
probably not that useful.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.120
So intensity.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.920
Can I change how much harm is being done?

16:07.920 --> 16:12.520
So as you might be aware, renewable energy from wind turbines and solar panels depends

16:12.520 --> 16:13.520
on the sun and the wind.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.080
And they don't always blow.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.640
Data centers are normally on 24-7, though.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.680
So how do you power something that's on with 24-7 with energy like that?

16:21.680 --> 16:24.960
The truth is that most of the time we rely on averages.

16:24.960 --> 16:30.000
So when Google says and said that they already run on green energy, they're basically saying

16:30.000 --> 16:36.320
they've used the same amount of energy as they've generated the same amount of energy

16:36.320 --> 16:39.520
from green sources as they've used over the year.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.400
That sounds fair.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.080
It's not quite that simple.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.400
Because you know how, say, people say you should get eight hours of sleep a day, more

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
or less.

16:48.400 --> 16:53.280
So over a year, which is maybe 9,000 hours, that means you should probably get 3,000 hours

16:53.280 --> 16:54.280
of sleep.

16:54.280 --> 17:01.160
Now, if I got 3,000 hours of sleep by sleeping from January 1 to April 1, then survived on

17:01.160 --> 17:05.760
Red Bull and chocolate bars for the rest of the year, I mean, it's better than no sleep.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.600
But I'm not sure it's 100% sustainable.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.320
And this is actually one of the things that we'll be talking about later.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.440
So this is the difference between annual and hourly and why it matters.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.680
And as I mentioned before, if you don't have massive solar farms and you can't invest on

17:19.680 --> 17:23.680
all this stuff yourself, some things you might need to do is think about how and when you

17:23.680 --> 17:26.480
run computing jobs or how you do stuff like this.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.800
Now, there was a talk all about this.

17:29.800 --> 17:35.760
And if you've heard of Kubernetes, right, there's basically, you can basically say,

17:35.760 --> 17:40.680
please run this computing job where it's green, where it's sunny, or please run it when it's

17:40.680 --> 17:42.120
when there's lots of energy on the grid.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
All right.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
There's a really good talk about it.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.840
So I'm not going to talk too much about it.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.840
Okay.

17:46.840 --> 17:51.360
So what I will talk about, though, is just going a bit more detail about what our computers

17:51.360 --> 17:53.220
run on, really, I suppose.

17:53.220 --> 17:58.440
So when we think of computers just using energy right now, what we're really using is a mixture

17:58.440 --> 18:02.840
of electricity from different sources, each with slightly different properties.

18:02.840 --> 18:07.440
So if you have some onsite renewables connected to, say, a building, that's one source, it

18:07.440 --> 18:09.160
will be very low carbon.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.720
But you won't have much control over when the power comes on, because it's basically

18:12.720 --> 18:15.000
the wind and the sun that's deciding this.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.640
And you're dependent on the outside environment.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.080
If you've ever used a laptop, you'd use battery storage here.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.480
And like, that means it comes on when you want it to be.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.040
I mean, a laptop that only turns on when it's sunny would not be that useful.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.320
So this is like what you could refer to as dispatchability or things like whether they're

18:30.320 --> 18:31.520
dispatchable or not.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
All right.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.160
But they have limited amounts of power.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.440
Or sometimes, but it's getting a lot better.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.640
Finally, there's the grid energy.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.920
Sometimes it's clean.

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
Sometimes it's dirty.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.280
And you can normally rely on it.

18:43.280 --> 18:49.760
But when, like, awful geopolitical events happen, they kind of change how much it costs,

18:49.760 --> 18:53.040
both in human terms and in actual financial terms.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.800
Now, I apologize for going super nerdy on some of this stuff.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.720
But if you've ever used a virtual machine, you'll understand that what we do with virtual

19:00.720 --> 19:06.400
machines is we take a big server, and then we use virtualization to turn it into a kind

19:06.400 --> 19:12.640
of abstract set of resources like compute, like computing power, network, RAM, and storage.

19:12.640 --> 19:18.000
And once we've got this kind of broken down way of thinking about it, we can then turn

19:18.000 --> 19:20.040
it into a series of smaller machines.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.800
So there might be one virtual machine that has lots of RAM, but only a little bit of

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
storage.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.280
And by doing that, I can basically make much, much more efficient use if I have a set of

19:29.280 --> 19:30.280
computers.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.360
And this idea of breaking things down and breaking them up again, I think is one thing

19:34.360 --> 19:37.400
that you can use when you think about energy as well.

19:37.400 --> 19:42.840
And there's a really cool paper that was published last year about this idea of eco visors.

19:42.840 --> 19:47.800
And the general idea is that you can do the same with power as what we've been doing with

19:47.800 --> 19:49.480
like computing resources.

19:49.480 --> 19:54.840
So if you virtualize the power as a kind of grid made of three different things, then

19:54.840 --> 19:59.360
you can allocate maybe a significant amount of battery for one program that needs to be

19:59.360 --> 20:03.520
on all the time, and maybe less to another, which doesn't need to be on all the time.

20:03.520 --> 20:07.180
So you can basically allocate it in these different ways.

20:07.180 --> 20:10.640
And this allows you to then do something like this.

20:10.640 --> 20:15.800
You could basically create virtual machines with certain amounts of virtualized power

20:15.800 --> 20:17.640
that you can actually work with.

20:17.640 --> 20:23.640
And this is actually something that you can then share visibility of to the machines because

20:23.640 --> 20:26.800
computers generally just aware of them having power.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.040
They don't really know about what the kind of power is like, whether it's green power,

20:31.040 --> 20:32.560
whether it's battery or so on.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.040
But you can make some of this available to people to see.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.920
And there are ways that you can implement like an API.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.880
So a program can be aware of its own power that it's using.

20:42.880 --> 20:48.080
And that allows you to then actually basically design a system so it's aware of this and

20:48.080 --> 20:51.720
can make much, much better use of this or turn things off when it doesn't need or actually

20:51.720 --> 20:55.400
use more when there's an abundance of green energy, for example.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.280
So that's kind of one of the ideas, which I think is super exciting to haven't seen

20:58.280 --> 21:00.240
anywhere else.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.800
You can also do some cool stuff with networking, carbon away networking.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.240
And I've got a few more slides, so I'm going to have to run through this quickly.

21:05.240 --> 21:10.500
But the short version is if I want to visit a website in England, sorry, and the website

21:10.500 --> 21:13.400
and the servers in Poland, that's all the way through here.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.320
Now, every single time there's going to be different kinds of energy that I use.

21:17.320 --> 21:22.000
But if the Internet was aware of the network, I could go I could take different routes,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.520
which are cleaner and greener and some kind of like low carbon trick shot thing.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.560
So this was actually was a this exists right now.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.900
There's a network program called Sion that does something like this already.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.440
There's also a way to extend IPv6 like this.

21:36.440 --> 21:42.280
We shared a paper specifically to this IETF Internet Architecture Board workshop all

21:42.280 --> 21:43.280
about this stuff.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.840
There's 26 papers, 26 papers all about this.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.000
And it's super exciting and interesting in my book.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.760
And funny direction, can I change where we're headed?

21:51.760 --> 21:57.040
So we work on this idea, a fossil free incident by 2030, because we think the Internet should

21:57.040 --> 21:58.640
be a global public good.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.800
And it's healthy for the planet.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.280
And you should be healthy, healthy for people who use it.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.880
And remember, I spoke about the idea of hourly figures like annual versus hourly.

22:05.880 --> 22:11.080
It's Google as one company, they've actually put a lot of time and money behind the idea

22:11.080 --> 22:15.320
of saying, well, we're going to run 24 seven carbon free energy, none of that Red Bull

22:15.320 --> 22:18.520
and chocolate stuff, we're going to do it properly, which is good.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.320
And this is something that we didn't realize was possible.

22:21.320 --> 22:24.520
Microsoft is now doing the same thing as again, but they're coming up with their own words,

22:24.520 --> 22:27.720
because they can't possibly have the same words for some reason.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
Right.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.200
And I thought, wow, this is really, really cool.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.960
And then I found out literally like a month ago that this company, this company here,

22:35.960 --> 22:39.120
Peninsula Clean Energy, they're a small nonprofit organization.

22:39.120 --> 22:43.800
They've said, oh, yeah, we we're already at 99 percent 24 seven matched.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.840
And we reckon we'll do it by 2025.

22:45.840 --> 22:52.040
So this is a small company, 100, maybe that is reaching, say, 100,000 people in California.

22:52.040 --> 22:56.120
They've basically built this into their governance to say, no, this is a priority over share

22:56.120 --> 22:58.880
buybacks, dividends to shareholders, everything like that.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.240
It's about intention.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.520
And they've basically got there.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.080
But what's super cool and for the FOSDEM group is that they've open sourced how they're doing

23:06.080 --> 23:07.080
it.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.780
They've actually shared the model they use to actually figure out where they buy the

23:09.780 --> 23:12.200
power from and the ideas behind this.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.000
And like, I think this is pretty freaking cool.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.600
And it's like, basically why I'm excited about open source and everything like that.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.560
Finally, I've only used American examples so far.

23:20.560 --> 23:25.840
But now I can't say that this was entirely Europe's plan because Nord Stream was kind

23:25.840 --> 23:28.820
of switched off by like Putin and everything like that.

23:28.820 --> 23:30.040
So they've spanned it this way.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.960
They've basically said, well, we've completely got rid of our dependence on Russian fossil

23:33.960 --> 23:34.960
fuels now.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.760
It went much faster than we expected.

23:37.760 --> 23:43.520
So we now have the possibility to redirect the money we would have spent on gas to repower

23:43.520 --> 23:47.400
EU, 250 billion euros to net zero industries.

23:47.400 --> 23:52.380
So this is basically a quarter of a trillion euros to basically talk to deploy the kind

23:52.380 --> 23:56.300
of cool green stuff rather than the bad brown stuff that I think we should be getting away

23:56.300 --> 23:57.880
from.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.100
So that's my recap.

23:59.100 --> 24:04.160
I wanted to share a model with you that I call CID, consumption, intensity and direction.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.580
Can I change how much we need?

24:05.580 --> 24:07.280
Can I change how much harm is done?

24:07.280 --> 24:09.080
Can I change where we're headed?

24:09.080 --> 24:11.800
And I want to tell you about a fossil free internet by 2030.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
It's achievable.

24:12.800 --> 24:17.440
We've seen that big firms do this, but small firms do it and faster and better.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.280
We've seen how it basically saves carbon.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.000
We know that doing this saves lives.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.680
It saves money because we know that fossil fuels are actually really, really expensive.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.440
And I've already done this slide once.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.400
I'm just going to skip it because I'm running out of time.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.920
But folks, I think that's the time I've used.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.840
So if you want to know more, my organisation, the Green Web Foundation, we publish open

24:36.840 --> 24:40.800
source code, we publish open data, and we work with other organisations who are trying

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
to do the same.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.960
We also offer training and consulting.

24:43.960 --> 24:50.020
If I've been speaking too quickly, there is a transcript of this entire talk at that website.

24:50.020 --> 24:55.920
And I'm also online as Mr Chris Adams on Twitter, but less so these days.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.560
And on Macedon social as there.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.360
And also if you use email, I use email too.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.360
Yeah.

25:02.360 --> 25:31.360
Thanks.
