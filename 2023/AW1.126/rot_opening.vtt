WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.280
Yeah, it's great to have a packed room here.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.600
Really good to see you all.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.040
Yeah, welcome again.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.800
Welcome to the Railways and Open Transport Defroom.

00:13.800 --> 00:19.640
We want to show you today something, what we are working on, what you are working on,

00:19.640 --> 00:25.880
what we all are working on, and the co-organizers of this defroom are me.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
I'm Cornelius Schumacher.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.120
I'm working for Deutsche Bahn.

00:29.120 --> 00:34.040
I'm in the open source community for a long time, and I'm really happy to expand my horizon

00:34.040 --> 00:35.040
here.

00:35.040 --> 00:40.080
So, Max Mere, who is also on the picture here, he can't be here with us.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.800
Some of you might know him.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.600
Yeah, but Mahalia is here, so please introduce yourself.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
Thank you, Cornelius.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.320
Yeah, my name is Mahalia Stefan.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.880
I'm from SPB, the Swiss Federal Railways, and I'm responsible for digitalization.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.440
And yeah, for the business driven open source projects, we're just going to explore.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.480
Hi, my name is Simon Clavier.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.720
I'm from the French railway, SNCF.

01:05.720 --> 01:11.840
I'm trying to spread open source in the group for 10 years now.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.200
This is a good result so far.

01:14.200 --> 01:20.160
I mean, I'm very happy to be there, and I'm very happy to meet you.

01:20.160 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, so just a few introductory words, introductory slides to set the stage for what we are doing

01:29.000 --> 01:31.560
today.

01:31.560 --> 01:36.960
We already showed you we are coming from train companies, and we met basically in an initiative

01:36.960 --> 01:40.080
to create an open rail foundation.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.760
So in space for railway companies or companies, organizations in the railway sector to collaborate

01:46.760 --> 01:51.000
via open source, to work on open source, that's a missing piece yet.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.720
There is nothing like that yet, and we are building that.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.160
So we are really happy to do that.

01:57.160 --> 02:03.600
It's not done yet, so we are in the process of creating it, but it will be there soon.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.680
There's a website.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.640
You see the URL on the slide.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.280
There's some more information.

02:08.280 --> 02:12.440
The idea is to really spread open source in the railway, and that's where we all personally

02:12.440 --> 02:17.640
stand behind and what we want to spread, and hopefully some of you who are related to this

02:17.640 --> 02:23.800
topic as well join us in this effort.

02:23.800 --> 02:29.480
While we are doing that, of course, the core of that is the openness, being open, doing

02:29.480 --> 02:30.640
open source software.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.840
That's why we are all here.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.960
That's why an event like Fostem is happening.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.360
For us, it's a little bit more than just the open source license.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.480
It's also about an open collaboration model, so having open governance.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.000
For the Open Rail Foundation specifically, of course, the goal is to enable open collaboration

02:49.000 --> 02:51.640
in the railway sector.

02:51.640 --> 02:57.560
But we don't want to stop at railways, and that's also because transport is more than

02:57.560 --> 02:59.920
just going on a train.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.280
You also have to get through the train and everything.

03:02.280 --> 03:10.440
So an open transport expands the domain, and also, topic-wise, the main topic today is

03:10.440 --> 03:14.720
open source software, but of course also open data, open APIs.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.320
They are very important in this space as well.

03:17.320 --> 03:22.480
So this all comes together in a bigger picture.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.020
We do want to talk about more than just railways.

03:25.020 --> 03:30.100
We also want to cover public transport basically, but want to be open, because in the end it's

03:30.100 --> 03:35.680
about the future of mobility, how do we move around, and how do we do that in a way which

03:35.680 --> 03:38.240
doesn't destroy the planet.

03:38.240 --> 03:43.080
So I think that's one of the underlying motivations for many of us.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.000
It's about sustainable transport.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.740
It's about creating the means of transportation, which will serve us for the next decades and

03:50.740 --> 03:52.160
millennia and whatever.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.760
Yeah, and we can't do that alone, of course.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.760
That's why we do it together, and we want to create things together.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.520
That's why we built the Open Rail Foundation.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.280
That's why we do something like the staff room.

04:04.280 --> 04:10.800
I hope we can get into contact with many people, that we can build bridges, that maybe some

04:10.800 --> 04:14.080
of the bubbles we are all in, we can connect.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.360
And we also would like to follow up with you later.

04:16.360 --> 04:23.360
So if you need anything, if you want to continue a discussion, we are happy to try to facilitate

04:23.360 --> 04:24.540
that.

04:24.540 --> 04:29.560
We don't have a channel for that yet, but we will create one if there's interest, and

04:29.560 --> 04:30.760
we will also support that.

04:30.760 --> 04:37.000
So we want to create together, do open source together, bring the openers into the railway,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.040
into the transport sector, continue with what is happening there, support the people who

04:41.040 --> 04:42.320
are there.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.120
And that's why we are here.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.800
And we are not alone.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.960
We have a great lineup of speakers.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.400
A lot of interesting presentations.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.960
The problem is pretty packed.

04:53.960 --> 05:01.200
So I'm really excited to see what is happening today, and that we see a lot of interesting

05:01.200 --> 05:03.200
content.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.360
Thanks for being here.

05:06.360 --> 05:12.400
I think we will dive in right into the content and start with the first presentation.

05:12.400 --> 05:17.520
So, Eilor, please join me here on the stage.

05:17.520 --> 05:24.520
And we just switch over the laptops, and then we can start with the first presentation.
