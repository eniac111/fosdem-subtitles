1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.040
All right, I think we can begin.

2
0:00:08.040 --> 0:00:09.880
So good afternoon.

3
0:00:09.880 --> 0:00:14.820
Thank you all for being here at the on-campus part of the Energy Dev Room.

4
0:00:14.820 --> 0:00:18.600
And as you might have seen, we kicked off the Energy Dev Room this morning with an online

5
0:00:18.600 --> 0:00:21.360
section and there was quite a bit of interaction.

6
0:00:21.360 --> 0:00:28.440
We had nine great presentations, over 70 people in the chat and, yeah, of course, many, multiple

7
0:00:28.440 --> 0:00:31.200
of that of people actually watching the live stream.

8
0:00:31.200 --> 0:00:34.960
So I was glad that the hybrid forum was working out.

9
0:00:34.960 --> 0:00:40.920
And yeah, we are here with the team that made this Energy Dev Room possible.

10
0:00:40.920 --> 0:00:46.520
Nicholas Hurning, Dan Brown, Anna-Linda Helsen and Kyua Herman.

11
0:00:46.520 --> 0:00:49.960
Some of them will be presenting or have presented already.

12
0:00:49.960 --> 0:00:54.320
My name is Nico Hicke and I've been active in the energy sector and the free and open

13
0:00:54.320 --> 0:00:58.960
source software community for quite a while now.

14
0:00:58.960 --> 0:01:01.040
I will repeat some of the talks I did this morning.

15
0:01:01.040 --> 0:01:07.720
I assume most of you here have not yet seen that talk, that speech.

16
0:01:07.720 --> 0:01:11.720
So in the last couple of years, I've seen free and open source software take over the

17
0:01:11.720 --> 0:01:13.960
energy sector.

18
0:01:13.960 --> 0:01:18.560
And being active in that energy sector, I thought it would be cool to have an Energy

19
0:01:18.560 --> 0:01:20.840
Dev Room here at FOSDAM like this.

20
0:01:20.840 --> 0:01:26.880
And FOSDAM gave us the opportunity after we submitted a proposal and then you responded

21
0:01:26.880 --> 0:01:31.120
with proposals and we were overwhelmed by the amount of proposals we got.

22
0:01:31.120 --> 0:01:37.280
We got submissions that range from home automation to green software and energy system modeling.

23
0:01:37.280 --> 0:01:41.800
And by adding the online section in the morning and shortening the talks, we were able to

24
0:01:41.800 --> 0:01:43.120
accommodate most of them.

25
0:01:43.120 --> 0:01:45.200
But still we have to say no to a couple.

26
0:01:45.200 --> 0:01:48.560
So maybe next year, right?

27
0:01:48.560 --> 0:01:50.760
Energy of course is a timely subject.

28
0:01:50.760 --> 0:01:55.960
Our society runs on cheap and reliable energy and that is something we can no longer take

29
0:01:55.960 --> 0:01:59.080
for granted.

30
0:01:59.080 --> 0:02:04.320
Scientists warn us that we are acting too slowly and need to ramp up the adoption of

31
0:02:04.320 --> 0:02:06.200
renewable energy.

32
0:02:06.200 --> 0:02:10.560
The Russian invasion of Ukraine made matters worse by disrupting supplies and causing a

33
0:02:10.560 --> 0:02:12.600
price hike.

34
0:02:12.600 --> 0:02:17.200
And so it is clear that our energy system is under pressure.

35
0:02:17.200 --> 0:02:24.720
Humans are protesting, businesses are shutting down and so society needs solutions and they

36
0:02:24.720 --> 0:02:26.760
also demand them.

37
0:02:26.760 --> 0:02:32.640
Unfortunately it is not just a matter of installing wind turbines and solar panels because these

38
0:02:32.640 --> 0:02:40.200
new sources of energy are decentralized and they are weather bound by nature and thus

39
0:02:40.200 --> 0:02:44.600
they require changes in energy management and distribution.

40
0:02:44.600 --> 0:02:50.920
While energy generation, consumption and distribution differs per country, we can really speed up

41
0:02:50.920 --> 0:02:57.960
the worldwide energy transition by a tremendous amount if we avoid the usual reinvention of

42
0:02:57.960 --> 0:02:59.840
the digital wheels.

43
0:02:59.840 --> 0:03:04.920
And we think that this is a mission that unites us here today at FOSTAM in this energy dev

44
0:03:04.920 --> 0:03:05.920
room.

45
0:03:05.920 --> 0:03:11.440
Today's presentations you will see or have seen will cover projects that model, manage

46
0:03:11.440 --> 0:03:17.440
and optimize energy and unfortunately these solutions will not be sufficient to solve

47
0:03:17.440 --> 0:03:22.720
the energy crisis or limit climate change by themselves.

48
0:03:22.720 --> 0:03:27.180
More impactful and direct changes will be necessary to achieve those goals but these

49
0:03:27.180 --> 0:03:32.080
projects can be the building blocks of the future energy system.

50
0:03:32.080 --> 0:03:37.240
So the projects presented here today besides being great projects are available under a

51
0:03:37.240 --> 0:03:43.840
free and open source license and this is important because it enables collaboration, mass adoption

52
0:03:43.840 --> 0:03:48.880
and customization to fit specific use cases.

53
0:03:48.880 --> 0:03:54.320
And this really fits the energy system in which everything is in a state of change and

54
0:03:54.320 --> 0:03:59.000
integration is needed to fulfill the purpose.

55
0:03:59.000 --> 0:04:05.320
So I hope you all will take this opportunity today to learn, get inspired and strengthen

56
0:04:05.320 --> 0:04:09.480
the free and open source software energy software community.

57
0:04:09.480 --> 0:04:15.080
So please raise your questions after the presentations in the Q&A or join the online conversation

58
0:04:15.080 --> 0:04:19.200
in the matrix chat room and Alina will keep an eye on that.

59
0:04:19.200 --> 0:04:24.120
And so all of us would like to thank everybody that made this all possible.

60
0:04:24.120 --> 0:04:27.600
So we'd like to thank the FOSTAM organizers and volunteers, the people that put in the

61
0:04:27.600 --> 0:04:33.880
effort to submit proposals, all selected speakers and all of you for participating.

62
0:04:33.880 --> 0:04:35.200
Thank you and have a great conference.
