1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.640
Thank you for coming to my talk.

2
0:00:06.640 --> 0:00:09.080
I'm very glad that the room is so packed.

3
0:00:09.080 --> 0:00:12.880
So I hope that this will be of interest to you.

4
0:00:12.880 --> 0:00:16.160
So my talk is named OpenStreetMap,

5
0:00:16.160 --> 0:00:18.360
one geographic database to rule them all,

6
0:00:18.360 --> 0:00:22.040
mapping the railway network for the public with the public.

7
0:00:22.040 --> 0:00:29.160
I will focus on OpenStreetMap and open data related topics for OSRD,

8
0:00:29.160 --> 0:00:34.000
which is an open source project developed by S&S,

9
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:35.800
the French railway company,

10
0:00:35.800 --> 0:00:38.000
which is part of the OpenRide Foundation.

11
0:00:38.000 --> 0:00:44.800
So there are many information about this here on the panel.

12
0:00:44.800 --> 0:00:51.680
Just a few remembers about why the railway company should invest in open data.

13
0:00:51.680 --> 0:00:57.360
I think you are all convinced that open data is the way to go for other projects.

14
0:00:57.360 --> 0:01:03.520
But inside the railway companies, it's not always that obvious.

15
0:01:03.520 --> 0:01:07.160
So we want long-distance trains across Europe,

16
0:01:07.160 --> 0:01:12.320
so we can construct together the transport network of the future on rails.

17
0:01:12.320 --> 0:01:17.080
We want to do European cooperation because we have

18
0:01:17.080 --> 0:01:21.520
railway infrastructure managers in all European countries that have the same needs,

19
0:01:21.520 --> 0:01:29.400
and yet we are still paying for different software providers for the same tools and the same data.

20
0:01:29.400 --> 0:01:35.920
Of course, we want free competition to prove that all of the train operators we

21
0:01:35.920 --> 0:01:37.880
work with are treated the same.

22
0:01:37.880 --> 0:01:44.080
So if we share the same source code and the same data, we can ensure that.

23
0:01:44.080 --> 0:01:50.360
I will dive into the specific need of OSRD, which is our project.

24
0:01:50.360 --> 0:01:55.320
Of course, you may have different data needs, so I will focus on this.

25
0:01:55.320 --> 0:02:00.440
If any in the room have other experience with other types of data,

26
0:02:00.440 --> 0:02:03.560
we'll be very happy to discuss with you.

27
0:02:03.560 --> 0:02:07.440
So in OSRD, we have four main features.

28
0:02:07.440 --> 0:02:15.160
Path finding or route compatibility check is to find train paths in the European railway network.

29
0:02:15.160 --> 0:02:22.840
Running time calculation is to calculate the time that the train will take to go from point A to point B.

30
0:02:22.840 --> 0:02:29.320
Conflict detection is to ensure that the train will not run into another train during its route.

31
0:02:29.320 --> 0:02:35.880
Short-term train planning is to add a new train into the timetable at the last minute.

32
0:02:35.880 --> 0:02:38.440
Maybe you were lucky to hear my colleague,

33
0:02:38.440 --> 0:02:41.080
Elouard, this morning talk about this topic.

34
0:02:41.080 --> 0:02:45.560
So to do these four features, we need a lot of data, tracks,

35
0:02:45.560 --> 0:02:49.320
geometry and topology at track level and not line level.

36
0:02:49.320 --> 0:02:53.880
Signals, switches, routes and detectors,

37
0:02:53.880 --> 0:02:57.000
which are kind of technical objects.

38
0:02:57.000 --> 0:03:03.560
Electrification of the tracks, loading gauge, speed limits, slopes,

39
0:03:03.560 --> 0:03:10.640
curves, real-time position of trains and stations can be useful for display use.

40
0:03:10.640 --> 0:03:14.200
So I've detailed the needs for each of the features,

41
0:03:14.200 --> 0:03:17.880
but what you can remind is that we need a lot of data,

42
0:03:17.880 --> 0:03:21.640
which is all geographic and in high quality.

43
0:03:21.640 --> 0:03:26.600
So the goal of this study and what I will show with you today is,

44
0:03:26.600 --> 0:03:33.640
we want to find and compare European level open data to choose the best source for our needs at OSRD,

45
0:03:33.640 --> 0:03:39.800
but also maybe for your needs if you're working with the same data needs in your projects.

46
0:03:39.800 --> 0:03:42.560
I've compared four data sources.

47
0:03:42.560 --> 0:03:49.360
The RIMF or Register of Infrastructure is a data source provided by the Agency for

48
0:03:49.360 --> 0:03:51.920
Redways of the European Union.

49
0:03:51.920 --> 0:04:00.040
Inspire is a European directive that's ensured to share geographic data across Europe.

50
0:04:00.040 --> 0:04:04.360
Then we can find open data platforms of infrastructure managers,

51
0:04:04.360 --> 0:04:07.760
but there are one data platform for each company,

52
0:04:07.760 --> 0:04:15.040
so it can be quite confusing to find the good data and of course they all use different formats.

53
0:04:15.040 --> 0:04:18.720
Finally, OpenStreetMap, which is as you all know,

54
0:04:18.720 --> 0:04:32.560
I hope, collaborative database of drug-free data and it fits all of our needs.

55
0:04:32.560 --> 0:04:33.880
We want open data,

56
0:04:33.880 --> 0:04:37.600
we want a data model which is consistent across Europe so that we

57
0:04:37.600 --> 0:04:41.720
don't have to change the parameter of our tool in each country.

58
0:04:41.720 --> 0:04:46.080
We want a data model that can evolve if we want to add a new feature.

59
0:04:46.080 --> 0:04:49.720
Of course, we need English documentation,

60
0:04:49.720 --> 0:04:54.240
easy data access, and wide data perimeter.

61
0:04:54.800 --> 0:04:57.640
Let's try to access some data.

62
0:04:57.640 --> 0:05:00.600
Here I am on the Inspire website.

63
0:05:00.600 --> 0:05:05.600
I can find broken link in a mixed language.

64
0:05:05.600 --> 0:05:12.200
Another example of Inspire data which is supposed to have good metadata.

65
0:05:12.200 --> 0:05:17.520
Here you can see the link to access the data which is in the middle of the page,

66
0:05:17.520 --> 0:05:19.680
so very easy to find.

67
0:05:19.680 --> 0:05:22.040
Finally, another example,

68
0:05:22.040 --> 0:05:24.040
I could go on and on about this,

69
0:05:24.040 --> 0:05:27.080
but this is a page in,

70
0:05:27.080 --> 0:05:33.360
I think, Swedish, but it cannot be translated nor copy and paste in any translator.

71
0:05:33.360 --> 0:05:37.280
So you have to click and download the data, hoping for the best.

72
0:05:37.280 --> 0:05:40.840
This is not to blame the people that have created these pages,

73
0:05:40.840 --> 0:05:48.160
but just to show that finding open data can be very time-consuming and very difficult,

74
0:05:48.160 --> 0:05:50.440
especially if you, as me,

75
0:05:50.440 --> 0:05:54.400
don't talk all the European languages.

76
0:05:54.400 --> 0:05:57.280
Then once you have downloaded the data,

77
0:05:57.280 --> 0:05:59.360
we can try to assess data quality.

78
0:05:59.360 --> 0:06:03.040
For example, this is the railway network in Italy that I've

79
0:06:03.040 --> 0:06:05.520
downloaded from the Inspire dataset.

80
0:06:05.520 --> 0:06:13.280
As you can see, there's supposedly a railway tunnel that links Tivita Vecchia and Sardinia.

81
0:06:13.280 --> 0:06:16.960
So I was very surprised by that.

82
0:06:16.960 --> 0:06:20.760
I checked on the official RFI website,

83
0:06:20.760 --> 0:06:23.720
which is the infrastructure manager for Italy.

84
0:06:23.720 --> 0:06:25.400
In the official website,

85
0:06:25.400 --> 0:06:28.080
we cannot find this underwater tunnel.

86
0:06:28.080 --> 0:06:35.960
So of course, I was not allowed to travel across all Europe to check

87
0:06:35.960 --> 0:06:40.680
all the data quality that I've downloaded. So yes.

88
0:06:40.680 --> 0:06:44.000
It didn't take you to ride you or there is a tunnel between stopping and stopping.

89
0:06:44.000 --> 0:06:46.840
In some places, it is true,

90
0:06:46.840 --> 0:06:49.680
but then there it is not.

91
0:06:50.520 --> 0:06:54.880
So first question we want to ask,

92
0:06:54.880 --> 0:06:58.600
for all the open data sources that I've found,

93
0:06:58.600 --> 0:07:01.560
are they compatible with Open Street Map?

94
0:07:01.560 --> 0:07:04.360
In many cases, this is the case,

95
0:07:04.360 --> 0:07:07.840
but unfortunately for the Creative Commons license,

96
0:07:07.840 --> 0:07:10.320
we must ask the provider if

97
0:07:10.320 --> 0:07:13.960
the attribution in Open Street Map is good enough.

98
0:07:13.960 --> 0:07:23.240
So this can take more time and it's not as easy as other type of licenses.

99
0:07:23.240 --> 0:07:25.000
So if you publish open data,

100
0:07:25.000 --> 0:07:30.120
it's important to check if the license is compatible with OSM.

101
0:07:30.120 --> 0:07:32.440
As you can see, unfortunately,

102
0:07:32.440 --> 0:07:37.320
there are still many European countries where I have found no open data source at all.

103
0:07:37.320 --> 0:07:39.760
So maybe it's because I don't speak the language,

104
0:07:39.760 --> 0:07:42.120
but still it's problematic.

105
0:07:42.120 --> 0:07:47.160
Then I've done a little quantitative comparison of the data I've found.

106
0:07:47.160 --> 0:07:51.800
So this is a comparison of track length total for one country.

107
0:07:51.800 --> 0:07:54.360
So by country and by source.

108
0:07:54.360 --> 0:07:56.840
As you can see, I have found data on

109
0:07:56.840 --> 0:07:59.760
Open Street Map for all of the European countries,

110
0:07:59.760 --> 0:08:05.840
but not an open data source that is not OSM for all countries.

111
0:08:05.840 --> 0:08:10.320
Even more, what we can see on the graph is that in every country,

112
0:08:10.320 --> 0:08:16.040
the Open Street Map data shows more tracks than the open data.

113
0:08:16.040 --> 0:08:20.880
So even if there is open data available,

114
0:08:20.880 --> 0:08:25.080
it seems that the Open Street Map data is more complete.

115
0:08:25.520 --> 0:08:30.000
Then I tried to design an indicator to see if

116
0:08:30.000 --> 0:08:37.640
all the useful data was available for OSR needs.

117
0:08:37.640 --> 0:08:41.680
So here you can see the same data needs that I've presented before,

118
0:08:41.680 --> 0:08:44.840
and I have classified them by necessity.

119
0:08:44.840 --> 0:08:49.240
So we require tracks and signals to make OSR run,

120
0:08:49.240 --> 0:08:52.400
and then the OSR data are optional,

121
0:08:52.400 --> 0:08:53.880
which means if we have them,

122
0:08:53.880 --> 0:08:57.200
this is good and we will have a better result.

123
0:08:57.200 --> 0:08:58.640
But if we don't have them,

124
0:08:58.640 --> 0:09:02.560
we can still run our tool and have a partial results.

125
0:09:02.560 --> 0:09:08.160
So I've designed an indicator which is good if we have the two required data,

126
0:09:08.160 --> 0:09:13.840
and two optional data or more.

127
0:09:13.840 --> 0:09:19.000
Then an okay indicator if we have part of the required data,

128
0:09:19.000 --> 0:09:26.520
the required indicator can be one and a half if we have partial data.

129
0:09:27.280 --> 0:09:29.480
It's quite complicated,

130
0:09:29.480 --> 0:09:33.160
but I have shared the full methodology on the blog,

131
0:09:33.160 --> 0:09:36.080
and I will send you the link after, so don't worry.

132
0:09:36.080 --> 0:09:40.800
What you have to remember is that this indicator will give you

133
0:09:40.800 --> 0:09:46.720
an overview of if the available data can be used for OSR needs.

134
0:09:46.720 --> 0:09:49.360
So what are the results of this study?

135
0:09:49.360 --> 0:09:52.840
First, what we can do is open data.

136
0:09:52.840 --> 0:09:55.360
Unfortunately, as you can see,

137
0:09:55.360 --> 0:09:57.360
the map is not so green.

138
0:09:57.360 --> 0:10:01.320
So there are a few countries where you can do

139
0:10:01.320 --> 0:10:06.440
okay or poor implementation of OSR using open data,

140
0:10:06.440 --> 0:10:08.840
excluding open street map,

141
0:10:08.840 --> 0:10:13.360
and then we can see the map for the open street map data.

142
0:10:13.360 --> 0:10:16.640
It's better. It's not.

143
0:10:16.640 --> 0:10:19.600
That's better, but it's better.

144
0:10:20.320 --> 0:10:26.840
There are many countries that were red in the first map that are now green,

145
0:10:26.840 --> 0:10:31.400
and there are many countries that were gray that are now red.

146
0:10:31.400 --> 0:10:34.440
So it's not that good, but it's better.

147
0:10:34.440 --> 0:10:38.360
What we can see is that open street map is the database we

148
0:10:38.360 --> 0:10:44.560
should use and improve because it's currently the best standard across Europe.

149
0:10:44.560 --> 0:10:47.120
So as I've said,

150
0:10:47.120 --> 0:10:51.520
you can look at the full data and methodology on our blog.

151
0:10:51.520 --> 0:10:56.160
So there is the detailed analysis for each country,

152
0:10:56.160 --> 0:11:00.800
as well as the sources for each open dataset that I found.

153
0:11:00.800 --> 0:11:04.600
So if you're interested in one country specifically,

154
0:11:04.600 --> 0:11:07.240
you can check out this.

155
0:11:07.680 --> 0:11:13.840
I'd like to thank the people that have done the icons for this presentation,

156
0:11:13.840 --> 0:11:19.040
and also a special thanks for the QGIS community that have allowed me to

157
0:11:19.040 --> 0:11:21.400
make the maps and most of the analysis.

158
0:11:21.400 --> 0:11:24.400
So maybe if there are QGIS developers there,

159
0:11:24.400 --> 0:11:26.880
thank you so much for your work.

160
0:11:26.880 --> 0:11:30.160
Finally, if you want to contact us,

161
0:11:30.160 --> 0:11:31.280
there are our emails.

162
0:11:31.280 --> 0:11:34.920
You can learn more about the OSR project on our website.

163
0:11:34.920 --> 0:11:36.160
You can chat with us,

164
0:11:36.160 --> 0:11:37.720
and if you're a railway company,

165
0:11:37.720 --> 0:11:40.560
you might be interested in joining the Open Rail Foundation.

166
0:11:40.560 --> 0:11:42.240
So let us know.

167
0:11:42.240 --> 0:11:44.480
Thank you for listening.
