1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.680
Okay, awesome to see there are so many people here.

2
0:00:10.680 --> 0:00:15.800
Really cool that there's big interest in the energy topic.

3
0:00:15.800 --> 0:00:24.200
My name is Frederik Stuhl and I'm from Aljondur which is a grid operator and I will be talking

4
0:00:24.200 --> 0:00:27.200
about Open Staff today.

5
0:00:27.200 --> 0:00:35.200
First of all, I put here in the graph, this is a load profile.

6
0:00:35.200 --> 0:00:43.400
So the energy load somewhere in the grid and you can see how it fluctuates over time.

7
0:00:43.400 --> 0:00:46.760
Sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's negative.

8
0:00:46.760 --> 0:00:52.000
This means whether there's netto production or netto consumption.

9
0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:58.800
And now the question is, or you could ask, if we are at the red line right now, what

10
0:00:58.800 --> 0:01:03.960
will be the load in the future?

11
0:01:03.960 --> 0:01:09.400
And that's what we want to predict and if you're interested in that then you can use

12
0:01:09.400 --> 0:01:14.560
Open Staff because Open Staff means short-term energy forecasting.

13
0:01:14.560 --> 0:01:22.000
Okay, let's zoom out a bit first and before I go into a bit more detail about what Open

14
0:01:22.000 --> 0:01:29.920
Staff does, first I want to talk about, I gave a short introduction about why this is relevant.

15
0:01:29.920 --> 0:01:36.400
I don't have hours so I have to keep it short but there's a lot to talk about here.

16
0:01:36.400 --> 0:01:42.640
But I want to start out with this picture and it's actually quite cool because I think

17
0:01:42.640 --> 0:01:51.800
the last presentation talked about flexible energy that consumers can use and this is

18
0:01:51.800 --> 0:01:56.400
one of the many things that are changing in the energy sector.

19
0:01:56.400 --> 0:02:02.400
So consumers have flexible products that also start producing.

20
0:02:02.400 --> 0:02:04.480
Consumers also have solar panels.

21
0:02:04.480 --> 0:02:07.760
Your local farmer might have a wind turbine somewhere.

22
0:02:07.760 --> 0:02:10.520
We have big wind parks on the sea.

23
0:02:10.520 --> 0:02:15.960
So there's all kinds of developments going on right now that make it harder for grid

24
0:02:15.960 --> 0:02:24.920
operators to forecast what's going to happen tomorrow or even the day after tomorrow.

25
0:02:24.920 --> 0:02:32.080
And I'll put this picture here because all the things that I mentioned you can see right

26
0:02:32.080 --> 0:02:39.560
there and probably in the future it's only going to get harder and harder.

27
0:02:39.560 --> 0:02:47.480
We're now going to focus on the renewable energy part because it's also quite impactful.

28
0:02:47.480 --> 0:02:53.440
As you can see on this graph here, this is for the Netherlands, the percentage of renewable

29
0:02:53.440 --> 0:02:55.360
energy production.

30
0:02:55.360 --> 0:03:00.360
And you can see that in just a couple of years, like five years, it has more than doubled

31
0:03:00.360 --> 0:03:05.400
the electricity percentage that has been produced by renewable sources.

32
0:03:05.400 --> 0:03:10.320
And renewable sources don't produce at a constant load, of course, they change all the time

33
0:03:10.320 --> 0:03:12.280
depending on weather.

34
0:03:12.280 --> 0:03:17.360
And this means it's harder to forecast.

35
0:03:17.360 --> 0:03:21.240
And to put that into perspective, I have another slide here.

36
0:03:21.240 --> 0:03:24.120
And this is a typical consumption profile.

37
0:03:24.120 --> 0:03:29.640
If you have your local neighborhood, then this is what the energy load will often look

38
0:03:29.640 --> 0:03:30.640
like.

39
0:03:30.640 --> 0:03:34.920
So you have the five peaks, which means it's a peak for every day and then in the weekend

40
0:03:34.920 --> 0:03:36.400
it's a bit lower.

41
0:03:36.400 --> 0:03:42.680
You can see the dips, these dips in the middle of the day, that's because there's a couple

42
0:03:42.680 --> 0:03:46.400
of solar panels on some roofs.

43
0:03:46.400 --> 0:03:48.920
It still looks easy to predict.

44
0:03:48.920 --> 0:03:57.480
If you go to other places where there's way more renewable energy, you can see these energy

45
0:03:57.480 --> 0:03:59.760
profiles change dramatically.

46
0:03:59.760 --> 0:04:06.720
So here you can see a profile for a big solar park.

47
0:04:06.720 --> 0:04:11.120
You can see these huge negative peaks, which on some days are there and some days they

48
0:04:11.120 --> 0:04:12.120
are not.

49
0:04:12.120 --> 0:04:17.800
Probably that's a cloudy day, so there's no or less energy generated.

50
0:04:17.800 --> 0:04:25.680
And this is an energy profile for a big wind farm, which you can see is, well, seems hard

51
0:04:25.680 --> 0:04:28.400
to predict because there seems no real...

52
0:04:28.400 --> 0:04:31.560
Why are you always negative?

53
0:04:31.560 --> 0:04:42.800
Yeah, so a negative energy means that the consumer or the customer is giving back to

54
0:04:42.800 --> 0:04:43.800
the grid.

55
0:04:43.800 --> 0:04:46.320
So then it's negative for us.

56
0:04:46.320 --> 0:04:47.320
If it's positive, it means...

57
0:04:47.320 --> 0:04:48.320
It means the negative number.

58
0:04:48.320 --> 0:04:49.320
Sorry?

59
0:04:49.320 --> 0:04:51.320
Our sunny day is the negative number.

60
0:04:51.320 --> 0:04:52.320
Yeah, exactly.

61
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:58.960
So if it means a big negative peak, it means the customer is producing a lot of energy.

62
0:04:58.960 --> 0:05:00.160
So it's just a convention.

63
0:05:00.160 --> 0:05:03.840
You could also switch the sign, but you have to choose one convention.

64
0:05:03.840 --> 0:05:06.160
It's power, not energy.

65
0:05:06.160 --> 0:05:07.160
Megawatts?

66
0:05:07.160 --> 0:05:08.160
Yeah, power.

67
0:05:08.160 --> 0:05:09.160
Yeah.

68
0:05:09.160 --> 0:05:13.360
So is this a site which uses electricity and also has solar?

69
0:05:13.360 --> 0:05:16.120
Because otherwise, how can it be using power?

70
0:05:16.120 --> 0:05:18.520
Yeah, so it's not just one site.

71
0:05:18.520 --> 0:05:23.160
It's more like a general profile for...

72
0:05:23.160 --> 0:05:29.440
Like a substation for the grid operator, but connected to it is a lot of solar.

73
0:05:29.440 --> 0:05:34.440
Okay, so there's load and there's also production.

74
0:05:34.440 --> 0:05:35.440
Yeah, exactly.

75
0:05:35.440 --> 0:05:38.640
So on all of these, there's load and production.

76
0:05:38.640 --> 0:05:45.360
But yeah, I just wanted to share this feeling.

77
0:05:45.360 --> 0:05:48.480
So this can be difficult.

78
0:05:48.480 --> 0:05:52.200
And this also leads to problems.

79
0:05:52.200 --> 0:05:59.320
And this is two maps of the Netherlands and the colored areas are the areas where Aleander

80
0:05:59.320 --> 0:06:01.200
is currently active.

81
0:06:01.200 --> 0:06:06.680
And on the left is energy consumption and on the right is energy production.

82
0:06:06.680 --> 0:06:11.880
And this map shows if you're a new customer and you want to be connected to the grid,

83
0:06:11.880 --> 0:06:17.200
if it's red, it's probably difficult because there's no more room.

84
0:06:17.200 --> 0:06:24.840
According to the Dirge law, the energy grid is full over there.

85
0:06:24.840 --> 0:06:31.040
And you can see that this is for huge areas in the Netherlands and also large areas on

86
0:06:31.040 --> 0:06:33.080
the consumption side.

87
0:06:33.080 --> 0:06:38.280
And of course, Aleander is doing everything they can to solve this by building new cables

88
0:06:38.280 --> 0:06:42.920
and new substations, but this takes time, a lot of time.

89
0:06:42.920 --> 0:06:47.080
And we don't have the time, as you can see in the graph before.

90
0:06:47.080 --> 0:06:56.920
So I don't have that one.

91
0:06:56.920 --> 0:07:04.680
But I assume it's very similar because we're not the only one who are having these issues.

92
0:07:04.680 --> 0:07:05.960
So how can we solve this?

93
0:07:05.960 --> 0:07:11.640
Well, one important thing is that we need grid insight.

94
0:07:11.640 --> 0:07:16.760
And therefore, this also includes forecasts.

95
0:07:16.760 --> 0:07:19.680
So transmission forecasts.

96
0:07:19.680 --> 0:07:25.440
And these are important for all three parts in electrical grid.

97
0:07:25.440 --> 0:07:27.520
So all three parties.

98
0:07:27.520 --> 0:07:37.400
So for customers, for DSOs, such as Aleander, and for TSOs, such as Tenet, which control

99
0:07:37.400 --> 0:07:43.960
the high voltage grid.

100
0:07:43.960 --> 0:07:51.040
Using these forecasts, operators can try to maintain grid safety and grid balance and

101
0:07:51.040 --> 0:07:59.040
can give customers as much electricity as they want and as they need because the need

102
0:07:59.040 --> 0:08:03.200
is high.

103
0:08:03.200 --> 0:08:07.040
With these forecasts, we can also enable smart solutions.

104
0:08:07.040 --> 0:08:16.120
And I put here two brochure pictures of those solutions.

105
0:08:16.120 --> 0:08:24.680
One of them is a pilot flex power, which was in Amsterdam, which was about charging electrical

106
0:08:24.680 --> 0:08:31.800
vehicles and charging them faster if it's possible and not charging them as fast if

107
0:08:31.800 --> 0:08:34.200
it's not possible.

108
0:08:34.200 --> 0:08:40.240
We at Aleander supplied forecasts for this project.

109
0:08:40.240 --> 0:08:46.400
And another platform is the GOPAX platform, which is like a trading platform for electricity

110
0:08:46.400 --> 0:08:56.640
where customers can trade with operators to either consume or to produce energy flexibly.

111
0:08:56.640 --> 0:09:02.400
And this is also being used right now at Aleander and we also provide a forecast for that.

112
0:09:02.400 --> 0:09:08.560
So it's no longer working.

113
0:09:08.560 --> 0:09:17.440
So let's use.

114
0:09:17.440 --> 0:09:22.400
So now let's talk about OpenStuff again, because that's why I'm here.

115
0:09:22.400 --> 0:09:26.800
I'm going to give a short introduction to OpenStuff and then I'm just going to give

116
0:09:26.800 --> 0:09:31.520
a short demo about OpenStuff, how you can make a forecast.

117
0:09:31.520 --> 0:09:38.200
And also want to talk a bit about using OpenStuff in operational settings.

118
0:09:38.200 --> 0:09:44.400
So first of all, the primary thing OpenStuff can help you with is that it's just a complete

119
0:09:44.400 --> 0:09:46.680
machine learning pipeline.

120
0:09:46.680 --> 0:09:53.200
So I'm just going to give a short list of what it can do.

121
0:09:53.200 --> 0:10:00.800
It handles input validation, such as like checking whether your data is complete.

122
0:10:00.800 --> 0:10:03.200
It has feature engineering.

123
0:10:03.200 --> 0:10:11.520
So it automatically calculates for you lag features or other features that are based

124
0:10:11.520 --> 0:10:13.120
on input features.

125
0:10:13.120 --> 0:10:20.120
So for example, if you input it with wind speed, it can calculate wind turbine power

126
0:10:20.120 --> 0:10:30.000
output for you, or the same for direct normal irradiance.

127
0:10:30.000 --> 0:10:39.720
Next it is some kind of intelligent train validation split of the time series.

128
0:10:39.720 --> 0:10:43.560
It has support for multiple types of regressors.

129
0:10:43.560 --> 0:10:49.560
So right now we have, for example, XGBoost, which is at Alejandro, the most commonly used

130
0:10:49.560 --> 0:10:50.560
one.

131
0:10:50.560 --> 0:10:56.580
But we also had a collaboration with Sonyo, which added Proloft to OpenStuff.

132
0:10:56.580 --> 0:10:58.920
And we also have support for probabilistic forecasts.

133
0:10:58.920 --> 0:11:05.560
So that means not just one line, but quantiles.

134
0:11:05.560 --> 0:11:12.880
And unless it has integrated the model and artifact storage using MLflow.

135
0:11:12.880 --> 0:11:14.920
So what does this all mean then?

136
0:11:14.920 --> 0:11:19.520
Let's go to an actual demo.

137
0:11:19.520 --> 0:11:24.880
So on this up here.

138
0:11:24.880 --> 0:11:29.320
That's a low resolution.

139
0:11:29.320 --> 0:11:33.120
Let's zoom out.

140
0:11:33.120 --> 0:11:37.600
It's a bit too much.

141
0:11:37.600 --> 0:11:39.600
Okay.

142
0:11:39.600 --> 0:11:44.480
So I'm just going to walk you through an example or how you could make a forecast.

143
0:11:44.480 --> 0:11:51.040
So first we need to make some kind of compare object that's just what you have to feed OpenStuff.

144
0:11:51.040 --> 0:11:53.780
Let's close this.

145
0:11:53.780 --> 0:11:57.160
So let's run this line.

146
0:11:57.160 --> 0:12:07.800
Next I put some example input in this project so we can load it.

147
0:12:07.800 --> 0:12:11.480
And we can visualize it.

148
0:12:11.480 --> 0:12:16.720
So as you can see here, well, this is upon a state of frame.

149
0:12:16.720 --> 0:12:22.160
And here we have the load and we have a lot of predictors.

150
0:12:22.160 --> 0:12:26.280
Well, some of these, well, the names should make sense.

151
0:12:26.280 --> 0:12:34.680
So for example, the amount of variation predicted by the K nearby or the temperature of these

152
0:12:34.680 --> 0:12:38.920
predictors are already in this example data.

153
0:12:38.920 --> 0:12:44.880
So if we have this, I can also plot it for you.

154
0:12:44.880 --> 0:12:52.480
You can see, well, this is another power profile.

155
0:12:52.480 --> 0:12:54.280
Okay.

156
0:12:54.280 --> 0:12:59.920
So now imagine you have this and you want to know, well, what's next?

157
0:12:59.920 --> 0:13:02.560
Then first we need to train a model.

158
0:13:02.560 --> 0:13:08.240
So OpenStuff has a train model pipeline which basically this, all those things I just mentioned.

159
0:13:08.240 --> 0:13:16.480
So we can just call the pipeline and let's hope the live demo does not fill me.

160
0:13:16.480 --> 0:13:22.760
It will take about 15 seconds, I think, to train the model and store it.

161
0:13:22.760 --> 0:13:30.480
So you can see some info about what it's doing.

162
0:13:30.480 --> 0:13:31.780
And it's stored.

163
0:13:31.780 --> 0:13:34.600
So let's have a look.

164
0:13:34.600 --> 0:13:48.840
Digital flow comes with an interface so we can directly see that we train a model.

165
0:13:48.840 --> 0:13:53.520
So right here, this was the run.

166
0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:55.960
Let's hope this works.

167
0:13:55.960 --> 0:13:59.920
I see that my internet is no longer working.

168
0:13:59.920 --> 0:14:02.360
So apparently this, then this figure doesn't work.

169
0:14:02.360 --> 0:14:15.240
All right, I'm not showing it.

170
0:14:15.240 --> 0:14:20.120
This is the MLflow interface and you can see that we just trained a model.

171
0:14:20.120 --> 0:14:24.240
You can also click on the model on the train run.

172
0:14:24.240 --> 0:14:30.200
This is just MLflow and you can see a bit more information about what happened during

173
0:14:30.200 --> 0:14:32.960
the training.

174
0:14:32.960 --> 0:14:38.280
Next, of course, we want to make a prediction.

175
0:14:38.280 --> 0:14:46.120
So again, OpenStuff has a pipeline for that so we can just say, okay, I want a prediction.

176
0:14:46.120 --> 0:14:53.120
So it's loading the model and using data to create a prediction and then we can visualize

177
0:14:53.120 --> 0:14:56.400
that as well.

178
0:14:56.400 --> 0:14:58.560
And then we have a graph right here.

179
0:14:58.560 --> 0:15:03.200
So this is the forecast that it made for the next.

180
0:15:03.200 --> 0:15:12.120
Well, this was in some example data in 2021, but about 48 hours of forecast.

181
0:15:12.120 --> 0:15:14.600
That's OpenStuff in practice.

182
0:15:14.600 --> 0:15:20.800
Let's go back to the presentation.

183
0:15:20.800 --> 0:15:23.640
To this slide.

184
0:15:23.640 --> 0:15:32.680
Yeah, so well, this flow has been a manual flow, but of course in reality, at least for

185
0:15:32.680 --> 0:15:37.120
if you're a grid operator, you want to do this in an operational setting.

186
0:15:37.120 --> 0:15:43.120
So this means that you want to do daily forecasts for a lot of different locations with all

187
0:15:43.120 --> 0:15:45.080
kinds of configurations.

188
0:15:45.080 --> 0:15:51.120
And OpenStuff also comes with a so-called reference implementation about how you could

189
0:15:51.120 --> 0:15:53.540
do this.

190
0:15:53.540 --> 0:15:58.440
So this is a picture of what you would have to do.

191
0:15:58.440 --> 0:16:02.920
So we have OpenStuff right here, which is basically I just showed you the training and

192
0:16:02.920 --> 0:16:05.840
forecasting pipeline.

193
0:16:05.840 --> 0:16:12.400
Then we have another package, which is called OpenStuff DBC database connector, which can

194
0:16:12.400 --> 0:16:15.680
connect to a database.

195
0:16:15.680 --> 0:16:26.480
And we use MySQL and InfluxDB to store all the data required to run it operationally.

196
0:16:26.480 --> 0:16:32.720
And we also have a Hafana dashboard built upon this database stack, so we can also see

197
0:16:32.720 --> 0:16:35.000
what's going on.

198
0:16:35.000 --> 0:16:39.760
And again, as I already have shown, you can use MLflow to keep track of all the models

199
0:16:39.760 --> 0:16:44.120
and all the runs that are being done to see what's going on.

200
0:16:44.120 --> 0:16:53.800
So I want to show this dashboard as well.

201
0:16:53.800 --> 0:16:57.080
So let's put it up here.

202
0:16:57.080 --> 0:17:00.560
Maybe some other ones.

203
0:17:00.560 --> 0:17:05.520
So this dashboard is just example data, so it's not our real dashboard.

204
0:17:05.520 --> 0:17:15.880
But here you can, for example, see some load that was there on the system.

205
0:17:15.880 --> 0:17:24.200
And you can also see that, for example, this is not just one area, but it has a sum of

206
0:17:24.200 --> 0:17:30.840
two systems, which is quite common in electrical grid that you have a lot of measurement points

207
0:17:30.840 --> 0:17:35.800
that you have to add together with different signs.

208
0:17:35.800 --> 0:17:46.360
And you can see, for example, here's then a live forecast of this location as well.

209
0:17:46.360 --> 0:17:55.800
You can also see plots of the feature importance that are obtained during training of the model.

210
0:17:55.800 --> 0:18:01.080
You can see which data the model has been trained over here.

211
0:18:01.080 --> 0:18:04.360
These plots are really small.

212
0:18:04.360 --> 0:18:05.360
Here you can see them.

213
0:18:05.360 --> 0:18:12.240
So it's a dashboard where you can see everything that Oberstaff does for every location that

214
0:18:12.240 --> 0:18:13.720
you could be interested in.

215
0:18:13.720 --> 0:18:19.040
When you talk about forecasts, are you, within the forecast, also taking other forecasts,

216
0:18:19.040 --> 0:18:22.800
like the weather forecast into account, or are you forecasting that yourself?

217
0:18:22.800 --> 0:18:28.880
No, so we use all kinds of data, and the weather forecast is...

218
0:18:28.880 --> 0:18:36.200
The question is whether we are using other forecasted data or whether we forecast those

219
0:18:36.200 --> 0:18:41.400
forecasts as well, like whether we forecast the weather ourselves.

220
0:18:41.400 --> 0:18:44.280
And the answer is that it depends a bit.

221
0:18:44.280 --> 0:18:51.320
So in general, we use the weather forecasts for multiple sources.

222
0:18:51.320 --> 0:18:58.320
And also, for example, price, like the day ahead pricing.

223
0:18:58.320 --> 0:19:01.320
So we use those data.

224
0:19:01.320 --> 0:19:09.880
But sometimes we also feed the prediction itself, or we feed one prediction into another

225
0:19:09.880 --> 0:19:12.480
prediction.

226
0:19:12.480 --> 0:19:16.760
So I mean, you can play around with that.

227
0:19:16.760 --> 0:19:21.760
Yeah, you have to feed Oberstaff with all the predictors that you wanted to know.

228
0:19:21.760 --> 0:19:26.280
Okay, let's move on.

229
0:19:26.280 --> 0:19:38.280
I've got one last slide, and that's basically the key information.

230
0:19:38.280 --> 0:19:42.800
Yeah, because that was my presentation.

231
0:19:42.800 --> 0:19:51.800
So I put all the info you might be interested in on this slide.

232
0:19:51.800 --> 0:20:00.120
And if there's any questions, then feel free to ask.

233
0:20:00.120 --> 0:20:02.800
Yes.

234
0:20:02.800 --> 0:20:14.560
So the information is really useful, but what is the purpose for the grid operator?

235
0:20:14.560 --> 0:20:19.400
What is the use of the grid operator to make of this information?

236
0:20:19.400 --> 0:20:21.840
Is it for congestion management?

237
0:20:21.840 --> 0:20:25.480
Is it for some kind of load shedding?

238
0:20:25.480 --> 0:20:28.200
What is the role of this exercise?

239
0:20:28.200 --> 0:20:39.640
So I think the question is, why would the grid operator be interested in forecasts,

240
0:20:39.640 --> 0:20:41.400
I guess is what you're asking.

241
0:20:41.400 --> 0:20:47.920
So there's many reasons, but I think you already mentioned congestion management is indeed

242
0:20:47.920 --> 0:20:53.560
an important reason, but also, well, grid insight.

243
0:20:53.560 --> 0:21:04.360
So yeah, the more congestion management is going to be used for the grid, the more important

244
0:21:04.360 --> 0:21:07.040
it is also to maintain grid safety.

245
0:21:07.040 --> 0:21:10.640
And grid safety is not just one operator.

246
0:21:10.640 --> 0:21:14.520
We're all connected to multiple grid operators.

247
0:21:14.520 --> 0:21:21.040
So everyone has to communicate what they are going to do and what they expect the energy

248
0:21:21.040 --> 0:21:22.760
flow to be the next day.

249
0:21:22.760 --> 0:21:29.800
So every operator can decide to do what's necessary to maintain grid safety.

250
0:21:29.800 --> 0:21:35.040
So that's what I mentioned before, the transmission forecasts.

251
0:21:35.040 --> 0:21:41.840
Every operator has to communicate to everyone who is connected to what they expect the load

252
0:21:41.840 --> 0:21:45.000
to be on the next day.

253
0:21:45.000 --> 0:21:46.480
I see that my time is up.

254
0:21:46.480 --> 0:21:49.440
So I'm afraid I have to answer the questions in the chat.

255
0:21:49.440 --> 0:21:50.440
Yeah.

256
0:21:50.440 --> 0:21:51.840
Or in the hallway.

257
0:21:51.840 --> 0:21:58.880
I think for time management, we have to learn from these talks, see if we can manage to

258
0:21:58.880 --> 0:22:00.720
keep a couple of more minutes for questions.

259
0:22:00.720 --> 0:22:01.720
Sorry.

260
0:22:01.720 --> 0:22:22.720
Thank you very much for listening.
