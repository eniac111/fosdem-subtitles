1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
I think we're good to go, Robbie.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:15.320
Okay, my name is Robbie Morrison and I'm here to talk about energy system modelling.

3
0:00:15.320 --> 0:00:19.400
I want to take you right up to the stratosphere.

4
0:00:19.400 --> 0:00:24.520
A couple of things on my background, I won't go through all this, but I started climate

5
0:00:24.520 --> 0:00:27.380
campaigning 33 years ago.

6
0:00:27.380 --> 0:00:38.440
I started High Resolution National Energy System Modelling 23 years ago and I started

7
0:00:38.440 --> 0:00:41.880
open source energy system modelling 20 years ago.

8
0:00:41.880 --> 0:00:48.080
So I was right at the beginning of those trends pretty much.

9
0:00:48.080 --> 0:00:53.280
I want to talk briefly about the Open Energy Modelling Initiative, which started about

10
0:00:53.280 --> 0:01:00.520
eight years ago and it's an informal collection of modellers.

11
0:01:00.520 --> 0:01:06.560
We now have about 1,000 people involved.

12
0:01:06.560 --> 0:01:11.720
The bulk of them are early stage full-time researchers.

13
0:01:11.720 --> 0:01:16.700
That gives you an idea of how much interest there is in this open side.

14
0:01:16.700 --> 0:01:21.800
There is an entire parallel universe doing closed modelling that we don't have much

15
0:01:21.800 --> 0:01:28.000
contact with in the power companies, in the World Bank, in the multilateral organisations.

16
0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:32.040
So I'm only going to talk about the open source side.

17
0:01:32.040 --> 0:01:46.040
The final point up here is that this whole field has flipped in the last year, radically.

18
0:01:46.040 --> 0:01:53.680
I get contacted by corporations and economists and so forth now, which would never have happened

19
0:01:53.680 --> 0:01:55.080
two years ago.

20
0:01:55.080 --> 0:01:59.840
So this is a complete game change.

21
0:01:59.840 --> 0:02:03.560
I'm not going to talk very much about energy system modelling, but if you want an introduction

22
0:02:03.560 --> 0:02:10.160
I recommend this YouTube, which is made with my partner in a car park and it's descriptive

23
0:02:10.160 --> 0:02:13.180
and it's quite good.

24
0:02:13.180 --> 0:02:17.800
This is a quick schematic showing what these models can capture.

25
0:02:17.800 --> 0:02:22.720
This just happens to be one that I pulled up that's hybrid with agent-based modelling

26
0:02:22.720 --> 0:02:23.720
in it.

27
0:02:23.720 --> 0:02:31.560
But you see a lot of the entities, if you like, that were being discussed in the previous

28
0:02:31.560 --> 0:02:36.160
talks, but brought together in a collective...

29
0:02:36.160 --> 0:02:41.400
So we have households and we have market operators and we have lines companies and we have markets

30
0:02:41.400 --> 0:02:49.480
and we have AC power flow and we have a lot of kit in the system, hydro system, storage,

31
0:02:49.480 --> 0:02:57.080
gas turbine sets and so forth, and a whole lot of external characteristics coming in

32
0:02:57.080 --> 0:03:02.840
through weather conditions, interest rates and so forth.

33
0:03:02.840 --> 0:03:07.420
So that sort of gives you the broad picture.

34
0:03:07.420 --> 0:03:13.280
If you want to look at the models that exist, this Wikipedia page is worthwhile.

35
0:03:13.280 --> 0:03:18.000
It's about half complete and it covers the various models.

36
0:03:18.000 --> 0:03:24.160
Some are directed specifically to the energy sector, but increasingly they're sector coupled

37
0:03:24.160 --> 0:03:28.640
and they come into the whole energy system.

38
0:03:28.640 --> 0:03:32.880
The basic paradigm is operations research.

39
0:03:32.880 --> 0:03:42.920
So the underlying model produces a set of constraints in a sparse matrix, has a goal

40
0:03:42.920 --> 0:03:49.640
function which is normally minimum aggregate cost and feeds that all into a solver and

41
0:03:49.640 --> 0:03:53.160
returns a result.

42
0:03:53.160 --> 0:03:59.360
The way that the analysis proceeds is by so-called comparative analysis of scenarios.

43
0:03:59.360 --> 0:04:07.760
So you pick a base scenario, a reference scenario and then you propose different scenarios that

44
0:04:07.760 --> 0:04:16.960
you want to explore with nuclear, without nuclear and so on and so on.

45
0:04:16.960 --> 0:04:18.560
These are the high resolution.

46
0:04:18.560 --> 0:04:21.320
They have a lot of detail in them.

47
0:04:21.320 --> 0:04:24.720
So they have the plant and the network and so forth in them.

48
0:04:24.720 --> 0:04:30.280
A lot of external circumstances, weather, demand for energy services and so forth.

49
0:04:30.280 --> 0:04:35.000
They are contiguous time which is really important nowadays because with renewables and storage

50
0:04:35.000 --> 0:04:39.920
you can't kind of do typical periods.

51
0:04:39.920 --> 0:04:45.200
You actually have to work your way through the entire system as it evolves.

52
0:04:45.200 --> 0:04:52.840
That evolution might be out for 30 years, out to 2050.

53
0:04:52.840 --> 0:04:56.480
There's a degree of different types of foresight.

54
0:04:56.480 --> 0:05:00.160
Sometimes it's perfect foresight so we know everything about the future.

55
0:05:00.160 --> 0:05:07.320
Other times it's stepwise so we do recursive dynamics.

56
0:05:07.320 --> 0:05:09.680
Not up here.

57
0:05:09.680 --> 0:05:13.160
Technological progress is included.

58
0:05:13.160 --> 0:05:19.680
One factor, multi-factor, for example, the uptake of a particular technology like solar,

59
0:05:19.680 --> 0:05:27.400
PV, the model will internally reduce the costs for that particular technology as it's taken

60
0:05:27.400 --> 0:05:31.120
up and it evolves through time.

61
0:05:31.120 --> 0:05:36.080
The optimisation is usually mixed integer linear programming.

62
0:05:36.080 --> 0:05:40.720
Anything else more exotic runs into performance issues.

63
0:05:40.720 --> 0:05:49.280
Conceptual extensions include embedded decision taking using agency, multi-criteria optimisation,

64
0:05:49.280 --> 0:05:55.760
some assessment of co-benefits such as urban air quality, sensitivity to the framing of

65
0:05:55.760 --> 0:06:04.360
the problem, the role of uncertainty and the exploration of near optimal solutions.

66
0:06:04.360 --> 0:06:07.080
So this is system modelling.

67
0:06:07.080 --> 0:06:13.360
All systems have kind of natural systems and problems if you like together have natural

68
0:06:13.360 --> 0:06:14.760
boundaries.

69
0:06:14.760 --> 0:06:21.880
If you want to model Europe or you want to model an energy system in Germany you probably

70
0:06:21.880 --> 0:06:26.480
want to go to the boundaries of Europe, for example, because that's kind of a natural

71
0:06:26.480 --> 0:06:29.560
point.

72
0:06:29.560 --> 0:06:33.640
The methods naturally seek technical synergies.

73
0:06:33.640 --> 0:06:37.960
That's one of the advantages of using these systems.

74
0:06:37.960 --> 0:06:46.320
The least cost approach will pick up the synergies and get them working.

75
0:06:46.320 --> 0:06:52.840
Future climate change is normally included, projected future climate change.

76
0:06:52.840 --> 0:06:59.840
These models may exhibit undue sensitivity to both data quality and to system resolution

77
0:06:59.840 --> 0:07:08.080
so they're not without issues that have to be explored by modellers.

78
0:07:08.080 --> 0:07:16.160
They started off with energy systems, electricity systems coupled into district heating, into

79
0:07:16.160 --> 0:07:17.800
gas and so forth.

80
0:07:17.800 --> 0:07:27.080
But they're increasingly branching out into land usage, water use, the industrial sector.

81
0:07:27.080 --> 0:07:32.800
When you're looking at things like hydrogen ammonia, thermal integration and steel production.

82
0:07:32.800 --> 0:07:39.520
Carbon capture is included now outside of the energy system.

83
0:07:39.520 --> 0:07:44.800
So residual emissions from cement and from agriculture are now being included in these

84
0:07:44.800 --> 0:07:45.800
models.

85
0:07:45.800 --> 0:07:52.320
E-mobility also, and we've had some talks about vehicle charging, but this is to look

86
0:07:52.320 --> 0:07:59.720
at the whole picture and not just the perspective of the householder or even the lines company.

87
0:07:59.720 --> 0:08:04.240
Co-benefits beyond climate change mitigation I mentioned.

88
0:08:04.240 --> 0:08:09.360
What isn't in the models is there is no embedded economy.

89
0:08:09.360 --> 0:08:14.780
If you want to do that, then you have to go to process-based integrated assessment models

90
0:08:14.780 --> 0:08:25.720
which are widely used by the IPCC, in which case you have a lot more economic take on

91
0:08:25.720 --> 0:08:29.160
the system.

92
0:08:29.160 --> 0:08:34.760
The model started off being open source, but there are good reasons why we want to look

93
0:08:34.760 --> 0:08:39.640
beyond open source.

94
0:08:39.640 --> 0:08:43.360
The first reason is to go to open science.

95
0:08:43.360 --> 0:08:50.120
So we want genuinely open data and we want under communal curation.

96
0:08:50.120 --> 0:08:54.480
We want full transparency.

97
0:08:54.480 --> 0:09:01.440
As modelers, we want an engaged overarching community so that we can compare and contribute

98
0:09:01.440 --> 0:09:04.560
and support each other.

99
0:09:04.560 --> 0:09:14.440
The goal in my take is that we should be looking at public policy analysis which is based on

100
0:09:14.440 --> 0:09:18.440
peer production, on commons-based peer production.

101
0:09:18.440 --> 0:09:23.920
The reason I say that, and I think there was a talk earlier this morning from the European

102
0:09:23.920 --> 0:09:29.680
Commission, people like the European Commission do not have the capacity to explore the solution

103
0:09:29.680 --> 0:09:37.120
space and I will add, nor do they have the creativity required.

104
0:09:37.120 --> 0:09:40.040
That's not a criticism, that's just an observation.

105
0:09:40.040 --> 0:09:48.160
So we really want a massive effort in exploring what our future could be out to 2050, the

106
0:09:48.160 --> 0:09:54.920
kinds of trajectories and pathways and requirements that are needed.

107
0:09:54.920 --> 0:10:00.640
Some potential for public engagement, but very few examples to date when these models

108
0:10:00.640 --> 0:10:05.640
are used for more specific projects.

109
0:10:05.640 --> 0:10:12.520
Our biggest Achilles heel is complete and coherent data for public interest analysis.

110
0:10:12.520 --> 0:10:14.520
We are not data scientists.

111
0:10:14.520 --> 0:10:20.760
We are desperate to have data which is complete and coherent.

112
0:10:20.760 --> 0:10:31.920
If it's dirty, it's a problem, if the semantics behind the data collection is somewhat inconsistent,

113
0:10:31.920 --> 0:10:33.360
it's a problem.

114
0:10:33.360 --> 0:10:35.360
If the information is missing, it's a problem.

115
0:10:35.360 --> 0:10:41.280
This may not be an issue for our data scientists using statistical techniques or machine learning,

116
0:10:41.280 --> 0:10:47.160
but it is for us.

117
0:10:47.160 --> 0:10:51.800
One issue that doesn't get much airplay are data standards and quite a lot of the data

118
0:10:51.800 --> 0:10:56.000
standards in this area, especially in the electricity sector, are proprietary.

119
0:10:56.000 --> 0:10:58.040
They come under so-called FRAND.

120
0:10:58.040 --> 0:11:04.200
We heard about that, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions.

121
0:11:04.200 --> 0:11:12.280
The problem is, is if the data standards are legally incumbent, then the code bases that

122
0:11:12.280 --> 0:11:20.560
reflect that and the data sets that comply with it could become derivative works under

123
0:11:20.560 --> 0:11:24.000
intellectual property law and we are in trouble.

124
0:11:24.000 --> 0:11:34.160
We want basically CC by 4.0 or something similar on the data standards.

125
0:11:34.160 --> 0:11:39.160
I'll skip the last bit on data sets actually.

126
0:11:39.160 --> 0:11:43.880
I'll skip this slide, but I just want to point out that the situation in Europe is pretty

127
0:11:43.880 --> 0:11:47.040
awful on a number of levels.

128
0:11:47.040 --> 0:11:53.160
Go to the US and you'll find a much friendlier environment for this kind of public interest

129
0:11:53.160 --> 0:11:54.160
information.

130
0:11:54.160 --> 0:11:59.960
Okay, the second part of my talk is about the Global South.

131
0:11:59.960 --> 0:12:06.200
The question is, why is someone who's white, male and old standing here talking about the

132
0:12:06.200 --> 0:12:07.960
Global South?

133
0:12:07.960 --> 0:12:12.600
My short answer is I'm from Aotearoa, New Zealand, and New Zealand became bicultural

134
0:12:12.600 --> 0:12:17.400
over my lifetime and I saw that process and contributed to it.

135
0:12:17.400 --> 0:12:25.800
I had radio programs in the early 90s on sustainability and conservation on tribal radio, on E.B.

136
0:12:25.800 --> 0:12:27.400
radio and so forth.

137
0:12:27.400 --> 0:12:29.840
I went to land occupations.

138
0:12:29.840 --> 0:12:37.840
I organized joint meetings with tribes, Hui they're called, and they take place on Marai.

139
0:12:37.840 --> 0:12:42.920
That's kind of my back story about why I can talk about this I think.

140
0:12:42.920 --> 0:12:51.160
This is a map of Africa with the high voltage network present and you'll see that there

141
0:12:51.160 --> 0:12:54.680
is very little structure there.

142
0:12:54.680 --> 0:12:58.000
South Africa a little more.

143
0:12:58.000 --> 0:13:03.120
David is going to talk a little more about this so I won't.

144
0:13:03.120 --> 0:13:09.240
This is another example of a model called Osmosis.

145
0:13:09.240 --> 0:13:15.800
This is in Africa and these are the cumulative trades out for the next 30 years.

146
0:13:15.800 --> 0:13:20.480
This is the kind of thing that the models are starting to look at.

147
0:13:20.480 --> 0:13:26.600
There are two overarching projects in this area, the Osmosis Global Project.

148
0:13:26.600 --> 0:13:32.720
Osmosis is written in a high level mathematical programming language called MathProg.

149
0:13:32.720 --> 0:13:37.400
The second one is Pipes to Meet Earth which is written in Python and you'll hear a little

150
0:13:37.400 --> 0:13:38.400
bit more about.

151
0:13:38.400 --> 0:13:46.640
One of the interesting things I looked at, Software Heritage collects the forks for a

152
0:13:46.640 --> 0:13:56.720
particular code base and lists 135 fork repositories for Osmosis and 308 fork repositories for

153
0:13:56.720 --> 0:13:58.280
pipes.

154
0:13:58.280 --> 0:14:04.000
That gives you an idea of how the open source world works when people will fork the project.

155
0:14:04.000 --> 0:14:10.800
These aren't hostile forks I presume and use them for their own work and hopefully contribute

156
0:14:10.800 --> 0:14:15.240
their contributions back upstream.

157
0:14:15.240 --> 0:14:22.760
This clear activity now in Central America, Costa Rica, South America, countries like

158
0:14:22.760 --> 0:14:29.960
Brazil, India and surrounding regions, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa.

159
0:14:29.960 --> 0:14:33.920
Most of this is in the context of academic work.

160
0:14:33.920 --> 0:14:40.960
We have no connection or very little connection crossing over with the multilateral development

161
0:14:40.960 --> 0:14:43.360
organisations and so forth.

162
0:14:43.360 --> 0:14:45.520
This is the parallel universe I mentioned.

163
0:14:45.520 --> 0:14:52.720
How are we doing for time?

164
0:14:52.720 --> 0:15:05.400
One of the issues that we face I think is interacting with official agencies because

165
0:15:05.400 --> 0:15:11.920
we are relatively informal and relatively self-directed.

166
0:15:11.920 --> 0:15:18.400
We also are a competition against the agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency

167
0:15:18.400 --> 0:15:22.600
or IRINO, whoever are doing their own analysis.

168
0:15:22.600 --> 0:15:27.560
I quite like this quote from Oliver Geddon, everyday politics is therefore dominated not

169
0:15:27.560 --> 0:15:33.680
by evidence-based policymaking but by attempts at policy-based evidencemaking and that's

170
0:15:33.680 --> 0:15:37.480
exactly what we want to avoid.

171
0:15:37.480 --> 0:15:42.280
I talked to the incumbent NGOs about using our kind of analysis and they weren't very

172
0:15:42.280 --> 0:15:46.320
interested but I feel quite encouraged now because there are a new set of foundation

173
0:15:46.320 --> 0:15:50.840
backed think tanks who are actually very keen on this kind of stuff.

174
0:15:50.840 --> 0:15:55.560
I'm sorry I can't mention too many names because I was ill for the two weeks prior to this

175
0:15:55.560 --> 0:16:00.160
talk and I didn't get consent to talk about them but a couple of climate analytics and

176
0:16:00.160 --> 0:16:04.040
transition zero.

177
0:16:04.040 --> 0:16:07.520
Some official agencies are starting to talk about open sourcing their stuff but they're

178
0:16:07.520 --> 0:16:15.020
not doing it in a particularly robust way in my opinion and this is a problem.

179
0:16:15.020 --> 0:16:20.560
They will either open, wash or they will do what's called throw their code over the wall

180
0:16:20.560 --> 0:16:24.000
which is put it on GitHub but there's no attempt to develop it.

181
0:16:24.000 --> 0:16:32.680
There are no issues listed and whether it even runs is open to question.

182
0:16:32.680 --> 0:16:40.880
In regards working with the Global South and I had about ten interviews with researchers

183
0:16:40.880 --> 0:16:47.240
in the Global South to try and find out what scopes and issues, their unstructured interviews

184
0:16:47.240 --> 0:16:51.600
but that was kind of interesting.

185
0:16:51.600 --> 0:17:00.000
The clear benefits of open source projects, of course few cost barriers with a caveat

186
0:17:00.000 --> 0:17:04.560
that the commercial solvers can be expensive.

187
0:17:04.560 --> 0:17:14.480
Open license for Garobi might equal three full time researchers in India for example.

188
0:17:14.480 --> 0:17:22.040
There's a soft technology transfer, it's bidirectional, it's lightweight.

189
0:17:22.040 --> 0:17:27.360
All the software projects bundle associated communities and this is I think really a useful

190
0:17:27.360 --> 0:17:31.000
part and the work is transparent.

191
0:17:31.000 --> 0:17:36.200
It can be studied and challenged which I think is really important.

192
0:17:36.200 --> 0:17:43.840
There are some cost cultural considerations I think that are necessary to explore and

193
0:17:43.840 --> 0:17:52.480
I talk about this in Aotearoa and New Zealand becoming bi-cultural but indigenous languages

194
0:17:52.480 --> 0:17:58.760
bundle different concepts and they're quite noticeably different.

195
0:17:58.760 --> 0:18:06.880
Sovereignty is an issue, it's really easy to transgress sovereignty without realising

196
0:18:06.880 --> 0:18:07.880
it.

197
0:18:07.880 --> 0:18:14.440
There's a question of representation, the projects are all pretty much white and male

198
0:18:14.440 --> 0:18:21.360
and the Global North at the moment.

199
0:18:21.360 --> 0:18:29.720
The next question really is also a matter to be traversed is that the framing of the

200
0:18:29.720 --> 0:18:34.800
models and the problems from a Global North perspective may not be very appropriate to

201
0:18:34.800 --> 0:18:39.920
the circumstances in the Global South.

202
0:18:39.920 --> 0:18:45.840
Final slide, challenges, just overarching challenges.

203
0:18:45.840 --> 0:18:54.360
So these won't be very surprising, code maintenance is always a challenge, support for maintainers.

204
0:18:54.360 --> 0:18:59.040
Building a suitable knowledge commons is going to be a real challenge.

205
0:18:59.040 --> 0:19:03.360
For instance the International Energy Agency only sells its data under non-disclosure,

206
0:19:03.360 --> 0:19:08.480
we don't get hold of that although it's collected from our national governments.

207
0:19:08.480 --> 0:19:16.720
The European Union is focused on data commodification through its single digital market.

208
0:19:16.720 --> 0:19:21.440
The scientific institutions are unnecessarily protective.

209
0:19:21.440 --> 0:19:24.440
I talked about cross-cultural issues.

210
0:19:24.440 --> 0:19:28.600
We need to find new ways of interacting with official agencies to get any of this information

211
0:19:28.600 --> 0:19:36.240
into the policy process and I'll just conclude with a quotation from an East German playwright

212
0:19:36.240 --> 0:19:41.480
Heine Muller, optimism is just a lack of information.

213
0:19:41.480 --> 0:19:48.560
Okay, that's it, thank you.

214
0:19:48.560 --> 0:19:56.160
Any questions?

215
0:19:56.160 --> 0:19:59.280
Can you speak up a little too if you ask questions?

216
0:19:59.280 --> 0:20:06.520
Maybe you said the European Union has some issues with open data.

217
0:20:06.520 --> 0:20:11.520
I know that the European Space Agency has a really strong footprint on doing all this

218
0:20:11.520 --> 0:20:17.120
as a Sentinel data stuff, maximum open to drive a new economy.

219
0:20:17.120 --> 0:20:20.920
So has this not spread to the other agencies yet?

220
0:20:20.920 --> 0:20:27.240
The ones I want to mention, and I will mention some names, the Merideth for Future Climate

221
0:20:27.240 --> 0:20:29.880
is under a bespoke licence.

222
0:20:29.880 --> 0:20:40.760
The YASA data on scenarios going forward also under a bespoke licence and so on.

223
0:20:40.760 --> 0:20:48.320
So a lot of the Horizon 2020 projects are also problematic.

224
0:20:48.320 --> 0:20:54.680
The stuff under statutory reporting is also legally encumbered so I can't for the life

225
0:20:54.680 --> 0:21:00.440
of me understand why, but some of it is technically encumbered.

226
0:21:00.440 --> 0:21:08.240
So for example the transparency platform run by NSE is legally encumbered.

227
0:21:08.240 --> 0:21:17.400
The EEX data from the European Energy Exchange also and also technically encumbered.

228
0:21:17.400 --> 0:21:21.960
You can't cut and paste it off the website.

229
0:21:21.960 --> 0:21:25.280
It's not very deep protection.

230
0:21:25.280 --> 0:21:29.920
And we've complained, my friends, to the regulator and they say it's compliant.

231
0:21:29.920 --> 0:21:30.920
Sorry, yeah.

232
0:21:30.920 --> 0:21:33.920
So now I've just got a comment though, which is, I've had a few minutes, you've been

233
0:21:33.920 --> 0:21:39.920
experiencing, for example, in London all the authorities were publishing air quality data

234
0:21:39.920 --> 0:21:44.920
under random crappy licences where they could do stupid things retrospectively.

235
0:21:44.920 --> 0:21:49.040
We've persuaded it to punishment under a UK Open Government licence.

236
0:21:49.040 --> 0:21:50.040
Another case I've...

237
0:21:50.040 --> 0:21:52.040
Open Government licence, UK 3.0.

238
0:21:52.040 --> 0:21:55.040
I don't know which one they're using, this was a few years ago.

239
0:21:55.040 --> 0:21:56.040
Yeah.

240
0:21:56.040 --> 0:21:59.040
And the other decent experience was with Elexon UK balancing where I...

241
0:21:59.040 --> 0:22:07.040
Well, I think I'm their only official agency, but other than that they can tell me to retract

242
0:22:07.040 --> 0:22:08.040
everything.

243
0:22:08.040 --> 0:22:10.040
I can use it completely openly, which is quite nice.

244
0:22:10.040 --> 0:22:12.040
So it can sometimes be worse.

245
0:22:12.040 --> 0:22:14.040
I just want to comment on licensing.

246
0:22:14.040 --> 0:22:18.040
The one that, really the only licence that works is CC by 4.0.

247
0:22:18.040 --> 0:22:25.040
If you go to the Open Government licence, UK 3.0, you'll find it's not interoperable

248
0:22:25.040 --> 0:22:28.040
with Creative Commons.

249
0:22:28.040 --> 0:22:31.040
And so you end up with legal data silos.

250
0:22:31.040 --> 0:22:35.040
But still better than 15 random licences written by people who aren't lawyers, right?

251
0:22:35.040 --> 0:22:36.040
It's still in the improvement.

252
0:22:36.040 --> 0:22:38.040
I know all the licences are written by lawyers.

253
0:22:38.040 --> 0:22:42.040
I can assure you that the lawyers all know what they're doing.

254
0:22:42.040 --> 0:22:45.040
I don't think you saw some of the things they published.

255
0:22:45.040 --> 0:22:46.040
Okay, okay, okay.

256
0:22:46.040 --> 0:22:52.040
Was there a question up there or no?

257
0:22:52.040 --> 0:22:53.040
Yeah.

258
0:22:53.040 --> 0:23:13.460
Has anyone done any of the IAM

259
0:23:13.460 --> 0:23:14.460
IAMs?

260
0:23:14.460 --> 0:23:20.460
I have a clause in the – remember when Java was proprietary?

261
0:23:20.460 --> 0:23:27.460
And you have to have an open language for a GPL licence.

262
0:23:27.460 --> 0:23:30.460
They use GAMS, which is not an open language.

263
0:23:30.460 --> 0:23:32.460
And I filed a bug report.

264
0:23:32.460 --> 0:23:37.460
And I know personally the lawyer who responded who said it was okay.

265
0:23:37.460 --> 0:23:40.460
Now, look, I'm not an open source lawyer.

266
0:23:40.460 --> 0:23:43.460
I don't know about the textbook.

267
0:23:43.460 --> 0:23:48.460
But that was where that discussion went.

268
0:23:48.460 --> 0:23:52.460
Have you seen any new funding come into this particular field to open things up more?

269
0:23:52.460 --> 0:23:56.460
Because all I know is that in December, I know that the Creative Commons group,

270
0:23:56.460 --> 0:24:00.460
they've started to hire new roles in this specific role

271
0:24:00.460 --> 0:24:04.460
because they landed like a small millions of euros grant for this.

272
0:24:04.460 --> 0:24:09.460
But beyond that, I don't know if there's any other groups starting to do stuff in this field.

273
0:24:09.460 --> 0:24:11.460
Thanks for answering.

274
0:24:11.460 --> 0:24:12.460
Okay, okay.

275
0:24:12.460 --> 0:24:13.460
Yeah, finished.

276
0:24:13.460 --> 0:24:14.460
No, good question.

277
0:24:14.460 --> 0:24:15.460
Oh, sorry.

278
0:24:15.460 --> 0:24:21.460
The question was funding specifically for open source.

279
0:24:21.460 --> 0:24:27.460
And the sort of short answer is – hang on.

280
0:24:27.460 --> 0:24:32.460
The short answer is that the funding – I'm talking about Germany, let's say –

281
0:24:32.460 --> 0:24:34.460
has been quite good for modelling in general.

282
0:24:34.460 --> 0:24:38.460
And it hasn't been specifically directed to open source.

283
0:24:38.460 --> 0:24:42.460
The high-level organisation, the Open Energy Modelling Initiative,

284
0:24:42.460 --> 0:24:44.460
hasn't needed resources as yet.

285
0:24:44.460 --> 0:24:48.460
But what will happen going forward, I don't know.

286
0:24:48.460 --> 0:24:55.460
But the funders are interested in the kind of open science component of what we do.

287
0:24:55.460 --> 0:24:57.460
That's quite clear.

288
0:24:57.460 --> 0:25:07.460
And I presume that the next round of funding will start looking for real open source projects to be for support.

289
0:25:07.460 --> 0:25:08.460
Yeah?

290
0:25:08.460 --> 0:25:14.460
Yeah, so what would you say in all the years of experience has to change?

291
0:25:14.460 --> 0:25:18.460
And how can we push for the change so that we get these open data?

292
0:25:18.460 --> 0:25:24.460
So what are the levers we have to pull with the open source?

293
0:25:24.460 --> 0:25:33.460
In a particular – well, the question was what levers are needed to come to genuinely open data.

294
0:25:33.460 --> 0:25:37.460
It depends on the jurisdiction. In the US it's quite good.

295
0:25:37.460 --> 0:25:41.460
Federal – work by federal employees is public domain.

296
0:25:41.460 --> 0:25:50.460
And there's been enough copyright – litigation around copyright that most of the stuff isn't actually covered – protected by copyright.

297
0:25:50.460 --> 0:25:53.460
They don't have a database directive.

298
0:25:53.460 --> 0:26:02.460
Tracking back to Europe, the only solution I can see is CC by 4.0 as a policy,

299
0:26:02.460 --> 0:26:06.460
which is lightweight, doesn't require legislative change and so forth.

300
0:26:06.460 --> 0:26:13.460
But it does require the European Union to get out of the data commodification.

301
0:26:13.460 --> 0:26:19.460
And I didn't mention it, but there's a thing called the Data Producers Act, which is still live,

302
0:26:19.460 --> 0:26:23.460
which might come back into the Data Act, the proposed Data Act.

303
0:26:23.460 --> 0:26:29.460
And that would be a complete travesty for us, because that would mean all this machine-generated data

304
0:26:29.460 --> 0:26:33.460
would now have its own intellectual property.

305
0:26:33.460 --> 0:26:37.460
And I couldn't think of anything worse.

306
0:26:37.460 --> 0:27:05.460
Okay, yep, thank you everyone.
