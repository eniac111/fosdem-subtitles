1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.280
Yeah, it's great to have a packed room here.

2
0:00:08.280 --> 0:00:09.600
Really good to see you all.

3
0:00:09.600 --> 0:00:11.040
Yeah, welcome again.

4
0:00:11.040 --> 0:00:13.800
Welcome to the Railways and Open Transport Defroom.

5
0:00:13.800 --> 0:00:19.640
We want to show you today something, what we are working on, what you are working on,

6
0:00:19.640 --> 0:00:25.880
what we all are working on, and the co-organizers of this defroom are me.

7
0:00:25.880 --> 0:00:26.880
I'm Cornelius Schumacher.

8
0:00:26.880 --> 0:00:29.120
I'm working for Deutsche Bahn.

9
0:00:29.120 --> 0:00:34.040
I'm in the open source community for a long time, and I'm really happy to expand my horizon

10
0:00:34.040 --> 0:00:35.040
here.

11
0:00:35.040 --> 0:00:40.080
So, Max Mere, who is also on the picture here, he can't be here with us.

12
0:00:40.080 --> 0:00:41.800
Some of you might know him.

13
0:00:41.800 --> 0:00:45.600
Yeah, but Mahalia is here, so please introduce yourself.

14
0:00:45.600 --> 0:00:46.600
Thank you, Cornelius.

15
0:00:46.600 --> 0:00:48.320
Yeah, my name is Mahalia Stefan.

16
0:00:48.320 --> 0:00:53.880
I'm from SPB, the Swiss Federal Railways, and I'm responsible for digitalization.

17
0:00:53.880 --> 0:00:59.440
And yeah, for the business driven open source projects, we're just going to explore.

18
0:00:59.440 --> 0:01:02.480
Hi, my name is Simon Clavier.

19
0:01:02.480 --> 0:01:05.720
I'm from the French railway, SNCF.

20
0:01:05.720 --> 0:01:11.840
I'm trying to spread open source in the group for 10 years now.

21
0:01:11.840 --> 0:01:14.200
This is a good result so far.

22
0:01:14.200 --> 0:01:20.160
I mean, I'm very happy to be there, and I'm very happy to meet you.

23
0:01:20.160 --> 0:01:29.000
Yeah, so just a few introductory words, introductory slides to set the stage for what we are doing

24
0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:31.560
today.

25
0:01:31.560 --> 0:01:36.960
We already showed you we are coming from train companies, and we met basically in an initiative

26
0:01:36.960 --> 0:01:40.080
to create an open rail foundation.

27
0:01:40.080 --> 0:01:46.760
So in space for railway companies or companies, organizations in the railway sector to collaborate

28
0:01:46.760 --> 0:01:51.000
via open source, to work on open source, that's a missing piece yet.

29
0:01:51.000 --> 0:01:53.720
There is nothing like that yet, and we are building that.

30
0:01:53.720 --> 0:01:57.160
So we are really happy to do that.

31
0:01:57.160 --> 0:02:03.600
It's not done yet, so we are in the process of creating it, but it will be there soon.

32
0:02:03.600 --> 0:02:04.680
There's a website.

33
0:02:04.680 --> 0:02:06.640
You see the URL on the slide.

34
0:02:06.640 --> 0:02:08.280
There's some more information.

35
0:02:08.280 --> 0:02:12.440
The idea is to really spread open source in the railway, and that's where we all personally

36
0:02:12.440 --> 0:02:17.640
stand behind and what we want to spread, and hopefully some of you who are related to this

37
0:02:17.640 --> 0:02:23.800
topic as well join us in this effort.

38
0:02:23.800 --> 0:02:29.480
While we are doing that, of course, the core of that is the openness, being open, doing

39
0:02:29.480 --> 0:02:30.640
open source software.

40
0:02:30.640 --> 0:02:31.840
That's why we are all here.

41
0:02:31.840 --> 0:02:35.960
That's why an event like Fostem is happening.

42
0:02:35.960 --> 0:02:39.360
For us, it's a little bit more than just the open source license.

43
0:02:39.360 --> 0:02:44.480
It's also about an open collaboration model, so having open governance.

44
0:02:44.480 --> 0:02:49.000
For the Open Rail Foundation specifically, of course, the goal is to enable open collaboration

45
0:02:49.000 --> 0:02:51.640
in the railway sector.

46
0:02:51.640 --> 0:02:57.560
But we don't want to stop at railways, and that's also because transport is more than

47
0:02:57.560 --> 0:02:59.920
just going on a train.

48
0:02:59.920 --> 0:03:02.280
You also have to get through the train and everything.

49
0:03:02.280 --> 0:03:10.440
So an open transport expands the domain, and also, topic-wise, the main topic today is

50
0:03:10.440 --> 0:03:14.720
open source software, but of course also open data, open APIs.

51
0:03:14.720 --> 0:03:17.320
They are very important in this space as well.

52
0:03:17.320 --> 0:03:22.480
So this all comes together in a bigger picture.

53
0:03:22.480 --> 0:03:25.020
We do want to talk about more than just railways.

54
0:03:25.020 --> 0:03:30.100
We also want to cover public transport basically, but want to be open, because in the end it's

55
0:03:30.100 --> 0:03:35.680
about the future of mobility, how do we move around, and how do we do that in a way which

56
0:03:35.680 --> 0:03:38.240
doesn't destroy the planet.

57
0:03:38.240 --> 0:03:43.080
So I think that's one of the underlying motivations for many of us.

58
0:03:43.080 --> 0:03:45.000
It's about sustainable transport.

59
0:03:45.000 --> 0:03:50.740
It's about creating the means of transportation, which will serve us for the next decades and

60
0:03:50.740 --> 0:03:52.160
millennia and whatever.

61
0:03:52.160 --> 0:03:54.760
Yeah, and we can't do that alone, of course.

62
0:03:54.760 --> 0:03:59.760
That's why we do it together, and we want to create things together.

63
0:03:59.760 --> 0:04:01.520
That's why we built the Open Rail Foundation.

64
0:04:01.520 --> 0:04:04.280
That's why we do something like the staff room.

65
0:04:04.280 --> 0:04:10.800
I hope we can get into contact with many people, that we can build bridges, that maybe some

66
0:04:10.800 --> 0:04:14.080
of the bubbles we are all in, we can connect.

67
0:04:14.080 --> 0:04:16.360
And we also would like to follow up with you later.

68
0:04:16.360 --> 0:04:23.360
So if you need anything, if you want to continue a discussion, we are happy to try to facilitate

69
0:04:23.360 --> 0:04:24.540
that.

70
0:04:24.540 --> 0:04:29.560
We don't have a channel for that yet, but we will create one if there's interest, and

71
0:04:29.560 --> 0:04:30.760
we will also support that.

72
0:04:30.760 --> 0:04:37.000
So we want to create together, do open source together, bring the openers into the railway,

73
0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:41.040
into the transport sector, continue with what is happening there, support the people who

74
0:04:41.040 --> 0:04:42.320
are there.

75
0:04:42.320 --> 0:04:44.120
And that's why we are here.

76
0:04:44.120 --> 0:04:45.800
And we are not alone.

77
0:04:45.800 --> 0:04:47.960
We have a great lineup of speakers.

78
0:04:47.960 --> 0:04:52.400
A lot of interesting presentations.

79
0:04:52.400 --> 0:04:53.960
The problem is pretty packed.

80
0:04:53.960 --> 0:05:01.200
So I'm really excited to see what is happening today, and that we see a lot of interesting

81
0:05:01.200 --> 0:05:03.200
content.

82
0:05:03.200 --> 0:05:06.360
Thanks for being here.

83
0:05:06.360 --> 0:05:12.400
I think we will dive in right into the content and start with the first presentation.

84
0:05:12.400 --> 0:05:17.520
So, Eilor, please join me here on the stage.

85
0:05:17.520 --> 0:05:24.520
And we just switch over the laptops, and then we can start with the first presentation.
