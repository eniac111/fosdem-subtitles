1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.600
Shortly about us, so I'm there on the left.

2
0:00:13.600 --> 0:00:20.900
So we are Saita Energy Flexibility Software Startup who decided to go the open source

3
0:00:20.900 --> 0:00:22.760
way two years ago.

4
0:00:22.760 --> 0:00:28.240
In this project we're working together with positive design, a small company in the Netherlands

5
0:00:28.240 --> 0:00:29.240
as well.

6
0:00:29.240 --> 0:00:33.480
They are more working on the UX part of this.

7
0:00:33.480 --> 0:00:38.680
So something where I really know a lot about are these two projects because we are building

8
0:00:38.680 --> 0:00:45.920
Flex Measures, a project we donated to the Linux Energy Foundation.

9
0:00:45.920 --> 0:00:50.760
Before you leave the room, get some swag over there.

10
0:00:50.760 --> 0:00:56.880
And together we built this V2G Liberty project which actually works as an umbrella for the

11
0:00:56.880 --> 0:00:57.880
rest.

12
0:00:57.880 --> 0:01:00.480
It's a vehicle to grid.

13
0:01:00.480 --> 0:01:02.040
Some of you might know roughly what it is.

14
0:01:02.040 --> 0:01:04.680
It has been a buzzword going around.

15
0:01:04.680 --> 0:01:10.680
It basically means other than most of the car charging that's going on today, just power

16
0:01:10.680 --> 0:01:15.640
into the car, you could actually get power out of the car, for instance, back onto the

17
0:01:15.640 --> 0:01:17.360
grid.

18
0:01:17.360 --> 0:01:23.000
Here I listed some use cases why that is supposedly a good idea.

19
0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:28.400
And specifically the third one, that might be pretty interesting because in a scenario

20
0:01:28.400 --> 0:01:36.280
where you have a varying energy price, now your car could be a trader.

21
0:01:36.280 --> 0:01:43.680
And actually the spreads in the energy markets are increasing by a lot these days.

22
0:01:43.680 --> 0:01:47.200
So that makes it suddenly interesting.

23
0:01:47.200 --> 0:01:53.120
And when I look at industry coming up with vehicle to grid by themselves, people observe

24
0:01:53.120 --> 0:01:57.120
a lot of delays.

25
0:01:57.120 --> 0:02:02.200
From my perspective it seems that the actual industrial players, closed source players

26
0:02:02.200 --> 0:02:05.440
are looking to actually deliver an ecosystem.

27
0:02:05.440 --> 0:02:10.520
These are pictures you are getting from the big names Hyundai, Volkswagen, Tesla.

28
0:02:10.520 --> 0:02:16.240
They are always thinking about putting multiple things in your home, basically taking it over.

29
0:02:16.240 --> 0:02:22.040
And that takes longer and it's also something I'm not looking forward to.

30
0:02:22.040 --> 0:02:25.560
That's why we decided to do this project.

31
0:02:25.560 --> 0:02:31.840
It's more than a year ago now, so we have more than a year of data from one location.

32
0:02:31.840 --> 0:02:36.960
And recently we've attracted some other enthusiasts and there's five more locations where this

33
0:02:36.960 --> 0:02:42.760
is being employed in reality.

34
0:02:42.760 --> 0:02:45.080
Quickly about the motivation, so why should we do that?

35
0:02:45.080 --> 0:02:50.280
Is this something that I want to sell with Site Energy Flexibility and focus on that

36
0:02:50.280 --> 0:02:51.280
completely?

37
0:02:51.280 --> 0:02:55.400
Actually, probably not.

38
0:02:55.400 --> 0:03:00.280
Site Energy Flexibility and our Flex Measures project is about making the best use of energy

39
0:03:00.280 --> 0:03:02.320
flexibility in general.

40
0:03:02.320 --> 0:03:06.880
But this is very cool to show that we can do something today.

41
0:03:06.880 --> 0:03:08.680
We don't have to wait.

42
0:03:08.680 --> 0:03:09.880
There's open source projects.

43
0:03:09.880 --> 0:03:12.200
If you put them together, they are super powerful.

44
0:03:12.200 --> 0:03:18.720
And that was a great way to bootstrap ourselves to challenge our technology.

45
0:03:18.720 --> 0:03:23.840
So I'll talk about the stack, the design of what V2G Liberty looks like if you use it,

46
0:03:23.840 --> 0:03:26.240
and some outlooks.

47
0:03:26.240 --> 0:03:31.720
First, what do you need in this context to actually get going?

48
0:03:31.720 --> 0:03:34.680
You won't find a lot of cars you can use for this.

49
0:03:34.680 --> 0:03:42.040
The Nissan Leaf is one of the only ones, specifically in 2021, that could do vehicle to grid.

50
0:03:42.040 --> 0:03:43.360
Same goes for the Charger.

51
0:03:43.360 --> 0:03:48.480
So this is the Charger from a Spanish company, Wallbox.

52
0:03:48.480 --> 0:03:55.240
Of course, they promised that open standards like OCPP will be very soon working.

53
0:03:55.240 --> 0:03:56.880
And that hasn't happened yet.

54
0:03:56.880 --> 0:03:58.800
So what was it?

55
0:03:58.800 --> 0:04:00.720
You need some kind of computer in your house.

56
0:04:00.720 --> 0:04:06.160
This has been mentioned in talks this morning already.

57
0:04:06.160 --> 0:04:09.160
And then we work with an energy contract with Dynamic Terrace.

58
0:04:09.160 --> 0:04:13.960
So in the Netherlands, you already have, I think, six or seven to choose from.

59
0:04:13.960 --> 0:04:14.960
That's going very hard.

60
0:04:14.960 --> 0:04:21.040
But the Tiber, for instance, is launching in a couple European countries and offers

61
0:04:21.040 --> 0:04:24.440
you that.

62
0:04:24.440 --> 0:04:29.120
And so this is actually the software architecture in a nutshell.

63
0:04:29.120 --> 0:04:31.960
I don't want to make it too difficult.

64
0:04:31.960 --> 0:04:39.600
If you imagine you put this in your house, what you need is to install Home Assistant.

65
0:04:39.600 --> 0:04:41.920
So that's this logo here.

66
0:04:41.920 --> 0:04:46.200
Home Assistant is a very stable home automation software.

67
0:04:46.200 --> 0:04:51.440
And we've basically built V2G Liberty as a Home Assistant plugin.

68
0:04:51.440 --> 0:04:52.720
That's also actually fun to do.

69
0:04:52.720 --> 0:05:00.440
It's nice when you get a lot of presence like UI widgets and things like that.

70
0:05:00.440 --> 0:05:07.280
And then Flex Measures is actually not running in the house.

71
0:05:07.280 --> 0:05:08.280
It could.

72
0:05:08.280 --> 0:05:09.280
It's dockerized.

73
0:05:09.280 --> 0:05:12.640
You could put it in the house next to your home automation software.

74
0:05:12.640 --> 0:05:18.280
And I think a couple of these enthusiasts who now are using this are doing that.

75
0:05:18.280 --> 0:05:22.720
But for such a software, it's sometimes nicer to run in the cloud because it's more difficult

76
0:05:22.720 --> 0:05:26.560
to maintain.

77
0:05:26.560 --> 0:05:33.600
Flex Measures itself is then responsible to get the relevant real-time data that is important

78
0:05:33.600 --> 0:05:36.440
to schedule the cars charging, discharging.

79
0:05:36.440 --> 0:05:43.560
So in this case, the prices that the consumer contract is on.

80
0:05:43.560 --> 0:05:46.520
We could also get, I think we actually do in a new version.

81
0:05:46.520 --> 0:05:47.520
It's not listed here.

82
0:05:47.520 --> 0:05:53.240
We also get some public data that helps us to look at the CO2 levels of your car cost

83
0:05:53.240 --> 0:05:54.240
consumption.

84
0:05:54.240 --> 0:06:00.040
So that would be another box right there.

85
0:06:00.040 --> 0:06:02.600
I talked about this connection.

86
0:06:02.600 --> 0:06:05.760
We have to somehow talk to the wallbox.

87
0:06:05.760 --> 0:06:07.960
And we found out for now, this has to be Modbus.

88
0:06:07.960 --> 0:06:11.720
And we found out how this responds.

89
0:06:11.720 --> 0:06:18.480
And we talked to the wallbox company if we're allowed to put our code in a public repository

90
0:06:18.480 --> 0:06:22.760
if you could see in the code which registers their hardware reacts to.

91
0:06:22.760 --> 0:06:26.400
But I think we've sorted it out.

92
0:06:26.400 --> 0:06:28.800
That was a bit difficult.

93
0:06:28.800 --> 0:06:35.280
And basically what we have to do is simply say start or stop the charging or discharging.

94
0:06:35.280 --> 0:06:39.560
And we are able to read the state of charge of the battery.

95
0:06:39.560 --> 0:06:44.280
And on the left side are some more nicer UX features.

96
0:06:44.280 --> 0:06:48.320
So you want to put along for a longer ride.

97
0:06:48.320 --> 0:06:52.400
You want to tell our system that the car needs to be full.

98
0:06:52.400 --> 0:06:54.440
And maybe you want some overrides.

99
0:06:54.440 --> 0:06:57.760
I'll come to those later.

100
0:06:57.760 --> 0:06:59.320
So first about the components.

101
0:06:59.320 --> 0:07:02.560
I mentioned Home Assistant.

102
0:07:02.560 --> 0:07:04.720
It has been around for a while now.

103
0:07:04.720 --> 0:07:07.600
I think it has also some origins in the Netherlands.

104
0:07:07.600 --> 0:07:13.200
But it's also developed in California now.

105
0:07:13.200 --> 0:07:18.000
Actually we had a couple of Home Assistant people over in a demo.

106
0:07:18.000 --> 0:07:21.000
I think it's these people here.

107
0:07:21.000 --> 0:07:25.440
So that was nice to actually have that also in real life.

108
0:07:25.440 --> 0:07:32.080
And as I said you can write plugins to really do your own logic on top of Home Assistant.

109
0:07:32.080 --> 0:07:35.840
Now Flexmeasures is the project that I spent the most time with.

110
0:07:35.840 --> 0:07:40.360
Our company develops that.

111
0:07:40.360 --> 0:07:46.960
Basically it's a data driven platform to get the best timing for your flexible energy assets.

112
0:07:46.960 --> 0:07:51.640
When should they be on or off.

113
0:07:51.640 --> 0:07:55.800
And what I'm talking to you today about is an e-mobility project.

114
0:07:55.800 --> 0:07:59.920
But we've also had some commercial projects in industry.

115
0:07:59.920 --> 0:08:00.920
The built environment.

116
0:08:00.920 --> 0:08:06.720
And actually our goal, our dream is that this all comes together.

117
0:08:06.720 --> 0:08:10.160
So for instance we're working on heating now.

118
0:08:10.160 --> 0:08:12.720
The energy flexibility of heating.

119
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:16.240
And heating and e-mobility somehow happen right next to each other.

120
0:08:16.240 --> 0:08:20.600
So that's where we want to go.

121
0:08:20.600 --> 0:08:24.440
And Flexmeasures itself has a UI.

122
0:08:24.440 --> 0:08:26.800
And I'm just showcasing that here.

123
0:08:26.800 --> 0:08:30.920
But in our project right now, in this V2G Liberty project that wasn't really being used.

124
0:08:30.920 --> 0:08:37.840
So what we want is for Flexmeasures to be a back end that you talk to through APIs.

125
0:08:37.840 --> 0:08:44.360
And you usually build your own user interfacing flexible service.

126
0:08:44.360 --> 0:08:49.960
Or you integrate what Flexmeasures helps you with into your existing service.

127
0:08:49.960 --> 0:08:53.720
That's actually what we did with V2G Liberty.

128
0:08:53.720 --> 0:09:00.360
So that's actually a kind of typical home assistant look for your dashboard.

129
0:09:00.360 --> 0:09:07.160
I think we have the goal to bring our own style into that when we have the help.

130
0:09:07.160 --> 0:09:08.920
But that's what you get.

131
0:09:08.920 --> 0:09:15.560
And you can see what your car is doing, what's the charging power right now, what's the state

132
0:09:15.560 --> 0:09:16.560
of charge.

133
0:09:16.560 --> 0:09:23.440
And then we come into the more interesting or self-built features.

134
0:09:23.440 --> 0:09:26.800
I will talk about this in another slide.

135
0:09:26.800 --> 0:09:31.280
But this basically shows you the state of charge that happened in blue.

136
0:09:31.280 --> 0:09:36.840
And what Flexmeasures has advised to happen with that in the upcoming hours.

137
0:09:36.840 --> 0:09:39.680
And the energy price.

138
0:09:39.680 --> 0:09:44.760
Here you have the ability as a user to simply say, I don't want this.

139
0:09:44.760 --> 0:09:48.400
Stop the automation.

140
0:09:48.400 --> 0:09:51.320
Or just charge the car right now.

141
0:09:51.320 --> 0:09:54.320
I don't care about the optimal result.

142
0:09:54.320 --> 0:10:00.080
You see if you've reserved the car.

143
0:10:00.080 --> 0:10:07.400
And that's where our partner, Positive Design, came in to rethink with us, well, if we get

144
0:10:07.400 --> 0:10:13.920
to design a V2G application, what do we want to experience when we use it?

145
0:10:13.920 --> 0:10:15.000
And these are the goals.

146
0:10:15.000 --> 0:10:21.080
It should basically, you want to be happy that it's there for a few weeks.

147
0:10:21.080 --> 0:10:23.880
But then you want to stop thinking about it every day.

148
0:10:23.880 --> 0:10:25.040
It should just happen.

149
0:10:25.040 --> 0:10:29.880
And you might look at your end result and be happy.

150
0:10:29.880 --> 0:10:33.120
And of course, it needs to be ready for you to do trips.

151
0:10:33.120 --> 0:10:40.760
At least trips, let's say, groceries, hospital, go to a nearby town, which in the Netherlands,

152
0:10:40.760 --> 0:10:44.800
of course, is quite easy.

153
0:10:44.800 --> 0:10:49.720
So Utrecht, Amsterdam, for instance, works with 20% of charge.

154
0:10:49.720 --> 0:10:51.320
Yeah.

155
0:10:51.320 --> 0:10:56.280
And CO2 saving and cost saving, of course, are the goals.

156
0:10:56.280 --> 0:11:00.200
You can really put numbers on.

157
0:11:00.200 --> 0:11:01.840
Yeah.

158
0:11:01.840 --> 0:11:05.160
Let's go one level deeper in the detail here.

159
0:11:05.160 --> 0:11:06.960
I'm not sure it was all clear.

160
0:11:06.960 --> 0:11:12.360
I already said the state of charge history will be shown to you in blue.

161
0:11:12.360 --> 0:11:16.320
And then it's shown to you what the planning would be.

162
0:11:16.320 --> 0:11:22.240
So here you can see a bit, if you look at the price in gray, that in the future, you

163
0:11:22.240 --> 0:11:24.760
will charge your battery because the price is low.

164
0:11:24.760 --> 0:11:27.600
You will discharge because there's a higher price later.

165
0:11:27.600 --> 0:11:33.400
And you do that twice, actually, in that day.

166
0:11:33.400 --> 0:11:39.320
And the new feature, as I said earlier, is that we're also plotting the CO2 intensity

167
0:11:39.320 --> 0:11:41.120
on the grid.

168
0:11:41.120 --> 0:11:44.440
That's going to happen in those hours.

169
0:11:44.440 --> 0:11:52.640
That's something we are basing on the scheduled coal and gas power for the upcoming days.

170
0:11:52.640 --> 0:11:55.840
Of course, there's also professional services for that.

171
0:11:55.840 --> 0:11:58.760
Somebody in the earlier talk mentioned electricity map.

172
0:11:58.760 --> 0:12:02.600
I think that's in the capital tool.

173
0:12:02.600 --> 0:12:05.680
That's a third-party integration.

174
0:12:05.680 --> 0:12:10.160
For cost reasons, we basically developed our own version of that.

175
0:12:10.160 --> 0:12:18.440
And what's interesting, of course, is you see there's a slight correlation.

176
0:12:18.440 --> 0:12:22.720
And we actually have a plot somewhere where we looked at the whole year from our data

177
0:12:22.720 --> 0:12:23.720
and checked.

178
0:12:23.720 --> 0:12:29.840
So is low carbon intensity, does that kind of correlate to lower prices?

179
0:12:29.840 --> 0:12:34.600
Because in that moment, you have a lot of sun and wind on the grid, which have zero

180
0:12:34.600 --> 0:12:35.600
marginal costs.

181
0:12:35.600 --> 0:12:38.680
So that can happen.

182
0:12:38.680 --> 0:12:44.800
And in the day ahead prices, of course, there's an economics that makes that complex.

183
0:12:44.800 --> 0:12:47.720
But it does actually happen during the day.

184
0:12:47.720 --> 0:12:55.440
During the day, you see a correlation in the night, not yet.

185
0:12:55.440 --> 0:13:00.600
So here's one or two features of this application in V2G Liberty.

186
0:13:00.600 --> 0:13:04.680
For instance, you come home from some trip.

187
0:13:04.680 --> 0:13:07.360
You connect the car.

188
0:13:07.360 --> 0:13:13.080
V2G Liberty talks to the charger and asks, so what's the deal with the car right now?

189
0:13:13.080 --> 0:13:14.080
What is the state of charge?

190
0:13:14.080 --> 0:13:17.960
It comes back as below 20%.

191
0:13:17.960 --> 0:13:19.920
And then there's only one course of action.

192
0:13:19.920 --> 0:13:23.040
We have to get up back to those 20%.

193
0:13:23.040 --> 0:13:33.160
So that's just a simple fallback that gets you to 60 to 80 kilometers.

194
0:13:33.160 --> 0:13:37.760
And when you've outlived your range anxiety, that should be OK.

195
0:13:37.760 --> 0:13:44.920
And another feature I've shown in the UI before as well, you can go to your calendar on your

196
0:13:44.920 --> 0:13:46.320
phone.

197
0:13:46.320 --> 0:13:48.920
And that's where Next Cloud comes in here.

198
0:13:48.920 --> 0:13:52.960
I'm a personal company where I'm next cloud users.

199
0:13:52.960 --> 0:13:56.000
And that's why I was so happy to bring Next Cloud in this as well.

200
0:13:56.000 --> 0:13:59.720
But it's basically just used for the agenda integration.

201
0:13:59.720 --> 0:14:02.320
You can use Google Calendar if you need to.

202
0:14:02.320 --> 0:14:04.400
That's no problem.

203
0:14:04.400 --> 0:14:07.760
So you make your own agenda for your car.

204
0:14:07.760 --> 0:14:12.960
And you create an entry in the agenda for your car that you're going on a road trip,

205
0:14:12.960 --> 0:14:15.960
let's say, tomorrow at 8 o'clock.

206
0:14:15.960 --> 0:14:19.800
And that will be picked up by V2G Liberty.

207
0:14:19.800 --> 0:14:21.640
What's nice, you see here the mobile view.

208
0:14:21.640 --> 0:14:24.760
I showed the desktop view before.

209
0:14:24.760 --> 0:14:32.280
But Home Assistant even gives you something that looks really well on your mobile app.

210
0:14:32.280 --> 0:14:39.240
Which is basically the same widgets just rearranged.

211
0:14:39.240 --> 0:14:40.880
So then this will show up.

212
0:14:40.880 --> 0:14:44.120
V2G Liberty will know about that reservation.

213
0:14:44.120 --> 0:14:46.520
Will contact Flexmeasures automatically.

214
0:14:46.520 --> 0:14:49.440
Flexmeasures will realize, oh, there's a new constraint coming in.

215
0:14:49.440 --> 0:14:51.440
I need to recompute everything.

216
0:14:51.440 --> 0:14:52.440
And that will change.

217
0:14:52.440 --> 0:14:58.640
So here you see State of Charge will go up to 100.

218
0:14:58.640 --> 0:15:01.600
Trying to avoid that price peak there in the middle.

219
0:15:01.600 --> 0:15:07.480
Do it cost efficiently.

220
0:15:07.480 --> 0:15:10.400
All right, so where are we now?

221
0:15:10.400 --> 0:15:13.000
This project.

222
0:15:13.000 --> 0:15:15.160
So it's working nice.

223
0:15:15.160 --> 0:15:20.880
First thing that comes to mind now that the other enthusiasts being on board it, the installation

224
0:15:20.880 --> 0:15:24.040
effort is still a bit high.

225
0:15:24.040 --> 0:15:29.320
We have written it all out on that V2G Liberty.

226
0:15:29.320 --> 0:15:34.800
It's not up to me, but as a couple steps you need to install your Home Assistant and make

227
0:15:34.800 --> 0:15:35.800
that plugin work.

228
0:15:35.800 --> 0:15:38.560
So there we can have some low hanging fruits in Home Assistant.

229
0:15:38.560 --> 0:15:42.920
You can basically have an actual plugin that is downloadable and updates itself and all

230
0:15:42.920 --> 0:15:43.920
that.

231
0:15:43.920 --> 0:15:47.000
You do have configurations to make in a file.

232
0:15:47.000 --> 0:15:48.920
That could be a wizard.

233
0:15:48.920 --> 0:15:52.640
There's some stuff there.

234
0:15:52.640 --> 0:15:56.640
It really helps us also with Flexmeasures to see if it runs in the background.

235
0:15:56.640 --> 0:15:59.400
What kind of monitoring do we need?

236
0:15:59.400 --> 0:16:00.880
It's really helpful.

237
0:16:00.880 --> 0:16:04.080
Some people are installing Flexmeasures themselves as well.

238
0:16:04.080 --> 0:16:10.720
So that's really, when you're really a techy enthusiast.

239
0:16:10.720 --> 0:16:17.160
I will briefly go into some earnings or economical results.

240
0:16:17.160 --> 0:16:24.000
So here's some hints that sometimes you have a day where there was huge price spreads and

241
0:16:24.000 --> 0:16:27.960
your car basically sat at home the whole day.

242
0:16:27.960 --> 0:16:35.400
And then you can really have a great day with earnings above the 10 euros in the Netherlands.

243
0:16:35.400 --> 0:16:42.520
Good to keep in mind, energy flexibility is only usable if your asset is there and you're

244
0:16:42.520 --> 0:16:44.560
not using it.

245
0:16:44.560 --> 0:16:51.240
So if you take your car for long rides every day, well, there's less time to do something

246
0:16:51.240 --> 0:16:57.000
with it and then you have less earnings.

247
0:16:57.000 --> 0:17:07.120
So actually this user is making a lot of kilometers actually.

248
0:17:07.120 --> 0:17:12.080
So here's a report from, I think this is 10 months of data.

249
0:17:12.080 --> 0:17:16.960
And this is an overview where you really see how much has been charged and discharged.

250
0:17:16.960 --> 0:17:26.200
So this is actually large parts of these kilowatt hours have actually been charged just to save

251
0:17:26.200 --> 0:17:33.480
them and give them back to the grid at a better time.

252
0:17:33.480 --> 0:17:42.680
This is where a lot of policymakers put high hopes on, of course, that cars will work as

253
0:17:42.680 --> 0:17:49.800
batteries so that the grid can use and carry energy at the best times.

254
0:17:49.800 --> 0:17:58.600
Well, there's a big Excel spreadsheet behind this, but if you just look at the bottom line,

255
0:17:58.600 --> 0:18:05.080
that you would see they have driven their car for 3,000 kilowatt hours and paid 200

256
0:18:05.080 --> 0:18:06.480
euros for that.

257
0:18:06.480 --> 0:18:08.960
It's a pretty good price.

258
0:18:08.960 --> 0:18:16.600
And you could compare with scenarios, so what if I had just a fixed cost contract from a

259
0:18:16.600 --> 0:18:18.280
year ago?

260
0:18:18.280 --> 0:18:20.600
You wouldn't get that today.

261
0:18:20.600 --> 0:18:22.840
You arrive at some price.

262
0:18:22.840 --> 0:18:26.800
As you all know, these numbers, they change so fast these days.

263
0:18:26.800 --> 0:18:31.680
And you got before the Ukraine crisis already lots of movement in the markets after that

264
0:18:31.680 --> 0:18:34.120
more.

265
0:18:34.120 --> 0:18:40.400
So this is difficult, I think, to make these look at these as hard facts, like how many

266
0:18:40.400 --> 0:18:45.960
euros will I save if I install this in 2023 or 2024?

267
0:18:45.960 --> 0:18:49.520
I will not subscribe on the number there.

268
0:18:49.520 --> 0:18:50.520
But there are savings.

269
0:18:50.520 --> 0:18:53.840
And there are some other people making these calculations also on a more higher level.

270
0:18:53.840 --> 0:18:56.680
But it's nice to have an actual project.

271
0:18:56.680 --> 0:18:59.520
This has really happened.

272
0:18:59.520 --> 0:19:01.320
We can dive deeper into the data.

273
0:19:01.320 --> 0:19:06.280
So if anybody's interested, let us know.

274
0:19:06.280 --> 0:19:12.240
And of course, another one, a part of the cost is that the V2G capable chargers are

275
0:19:12.240 --> 0:19:14.100
currently much more expensive.

276
0:19:14.100 --> 0:19:17.920
But I think the difference is coming down soon.

277
0:19:17.920 --> 0:19:20.920
Right.

278
0:19:20.920 --> 0:19:29.880
So what we will do, the installation I already mentioned, updating V2G Liberty if you have

279
0:19:29.880 --> 0:19:35.200
it running and we have a new version, that can be easier.

280
0:19:35.200 --> 0:19:39.240
We want to actually show you KPIs.

281
0:19:39.240 --> 0:19:44.760
What did I save in money or CO2, let's say, last month?

282
0:19:44.760 --> 0:19:49.160
I think per day can also work.

283
0:19:49.160 --> 0:19:54.360
Now we have more users, enthusiasts who installed it at home and rerun it.

284
0:19:54.360 --> 0:20:01.080
So the learning curve is going up right now in the sense of how much information we get.

285
0:20:01.080 --> 0:20:02.080
It's great.

286
0:20:02.080 --> 0:20:08.640
And it's going to be an interesting year with more things to support.

287
0:20:08.640 --> 0:20:17.680
I'm not sure what kind of things this project should support, the V2G Liberty project.

288
0:20:17.680 --> 0:20:22.480
It potentially has to do with demand from the community.

289
0:20:22.480 --> 0:20:30.080
And of course, if chargers actually support OCPP, then that's just a great idea.

290
0:20:30.080 --> 0:20:35.840
And on the FlexMeter side, that's something I also know the near future a bit.

291
0:20:35.840 --> 0:20:44.560
I already mentioned that we are tackling immobility in projects like this, but also heat in other

292
0:20:44.560 --> 0:20:48.200
projects and we don't look at the built environment.

293
0:20:48.200 --> 0:20:49.440
This has to come together.

294
0:20:49.440 --> 0:20:58.720
So our big next challenge is to really model the energy flexibility from these two usages

295
0:20:58.720 --> 0:21:06.600
of energy combined and make one computation about a building or a site that uses heat

296
0:21:06.600 --> 0:21:14.880
and uses immobility as two big, flexible power demands and come up with one optimization

297
0:21:14.880 --> 0:21:17.920
and then actually automate that.

298
0:21:17.920 --> 0:21:24.480
So that's our next big milestone.

299
0:21:24.480 --> 0:21:28.360
And the other thing that's really important, of course, to mention is network congestion.

300
0:21:28.360 --> 0:21:37.520
That's the network operators are coming up with ideas how a project like this, flexible

301
0:21:37.520 --> 0:21:40.600
consumers can do their part.

302
0:21:40.600 --> 0:21:45.560
So for instance, can stop their demands in a specific moment and in a specific region,

303
0:21:45.560 --> 0:21:50.480
which would help on the lower and medium parts of the grid.

304
0:21:50.480 --> 0:21:57.080
And that's also for us really on the map.

305
0:21:57.080 --> 0:22:00.480
This is almost at the end.

306
0:22:00.480 --> 0:22:06.720
Of course, we need to hear questions, but of course, for people to get in contact.

307
0:22:06.720 --> 0:22:11.760
And I'm just listening to the best contact points for each of the projects.

308
0:22:11.760 --> 0:22:18.480
For V2G Liberty, that's just come to the GitHub project and interact there.

309
0:22:18.480 --> 0:22:26.400
Flexmeasures itself has more channels that you can contact us on.

310
0:22:26.400 --> 0:22:32.800
We listed them here in the read the docs, for instance, through LF energy, there are

311
0:22:32.800 --> 0:22:33.800
ways.

312
0:22:33.800 --> 0:22:37.120
I do have, I think I have two minutes.

313
0:22:37.120 --> 0:22:43.920
So one thing I have on the very last slide before I close is something we built in Flexmeasures

314
0:22:43.920 --> 0:22:50.200
recently because if you talk about projects like these, basically after they happen and

315
0:22:50.200 --> 0:22:54.280
you just summarizing what happened, they don't really come alive.

316
0:22:54.280 --> 0:23:00.160
Because what actually happens and what we do is that throughout the day, new situations

317
0:23:00.160 --> 0:23:01.960
arise all the time.

318
0:23:01.960 --> 0:23:07.400
New circumstances like the car comes back, it has a completely new state of charge.

319
0:23:07.400 --> 0:23:12.120
It could be lower, maybe they charged on the way, it's higher.

320
0:23:12.120 --> 0:23:13.680
You don't know.

321
0:23:13.680 --> 0:23:16.720
This is a new situation, so we need to recompute.

322
0:23:16.720 --> 0:23:24.920
And in each of these situations, you also need to have a different set of forecasts.

323
0:23:24.920 --> 0:23:31.120
So you ask yourself, it's this point in time, I was asked to recompute.

324
0:23:31.120 --> 0:23:36.440
And I look at the set of forecasts, what do I know now about the state of things?

325
0:23:36.440 --> 0:23:39.600
So maybe not all the devices have sent me everything yet.

326
0:23:39.600 --> 0:23:44.600
There's always delays, there's always lags in IoT applications.

327
0:23:44.600 --> 0:23:48.240
In the future, which forecasts do I have now available?

328
0:23:48.240 --> 0:23:51.840
And that's what I mean with it doesn't come alive, right?

329
0:23:51.840 --> 0:23:55.040
And let's see if it works.

330
0:23:55.040 --> 0:23:57.040
Yeah.

331
0:23:57.040 --> 0:24:02.800
We made a UI that uses JavaScript so you can travel through time basically.

332
0:24:02.800 --> 0:24:09.400
So imagine that that bar is now, you hit that button, and we have kept the old schedules,

333
0:24:09.400 --> 0:24:13.560
we have kept everything that's old, and we know when we knew it.

334
0:24:13.560 --> 0:24:15.840
That's how we can travel through time.

335
0:24:15.840 --> 0:24:19.540
And when we stop it anywhere, we know what we knew at the time.

336
0:24:19.540 --> 0:24:23.280
So let's say we knew the day ahead prices.

337
0:24:23.280 --> 0:24:27.480
You can see the day ahead prices on top coming in in batches, for instance.

338
0:24:27.480 --> 0:24:31.240
And then the new schedules, that's a red dotted line also.

339
0:24:31.240 --> 0:24:33.160
All right.

340
0:24:33.160 --> 0:24:38.720
Let me stop in time and if there's any questions.

341
0:24:38.720 --> 0:24:43.920
All right, there's a few, but who decides on the order?

342
0:24:43.920 --> 0:24:49.280
Well, let's just start on my left.

343
0:24:49.280 --> 0:25:01.560
I think that V2D Liberty.

344
0:25:01.560 --> 0:25:02.560
Can you repeat the question?

345
0:25:02.560 --> 0:25:03.640
Oh yeah, sure.

346
0:25:03.640 --> 0:25:10.720
The question was if this has been built for one car or if there's the opportunity to have

347
0:25:10.720 --> 0:25:17.920
multiple cars at the same location on a charging station supported.

348
0:25:17.920 --> 0:25:24.400
And V2G Liberty has right now been built for one household with one car, which is expandable

349
0:25:24.400 --> 0:25:27.960
in principle through some work.

350
0:25:27.960 --> 0:25:33.800
And Flexmeasures itself has a solver that could also schedule multiple cars.

351
0:25:33.800 --> 0:25:36.560
So that's not a technical problem on that side.

352
0:25:36.560 --> 0:25:49.320
I have a question about the price spread that you talked about.

353
0:25:49.320 --> 0:25:52.640
You optimize on day ahead prices and as you know, day ahead prices are a result of what

354
0:25:52.640 --> 0:25:57.640
the energy suppliers predicting that customers will do the day ahead.

355
0:25:57.640 --> 0:26:01.840
Yet by what you're doing, you're changing that behavior.

356
0:26:01.840 --> 0:26:07.440
So inherently you're not doing what the supplier has bought for you on the day ahead market.

357
0:26:07.440 --> 0:26:13.360
So then you can imagine if thousands of people are doing this, then of course the suppliers

358
0:26:13.360 --> 0:26:17.440
need to change the way they are forecasting and get this at this loop.

359
0:26:17.440 --> 0:26:21.000
Have you thought about how to solve that issue?

360
0:26:21.000 --> 0:26:23.000
Yes.

361
0:26:23.000 --> 0:26:28.480
So the question is that for the day ahead prices, the energy suppliers make a forecast

362
0:26:28.480 --> 0:26:34.040
usually or traditionally what all the consumers will consume.

363
0:26:34.040 --> 0:26:38.200
Aggregated over thousands of consumers, they get a nice curve and they try to buy that.

364
0:26:38.200 --> 0:26:45.040
Now if the consumers react to that price, you have a loop, somehow a more dynamic system.

365
0:26:45.040 --> 0:26:47.560
The question was if I have thought about it.

366
0:26:47.560 --> 0:26:50.240
Yes, of course.

367
0:26:50.240 --> 0:26:51.240
It's super interesting.

368
0:26:51.240 --> 0:26:52.320
There's two thoughts.

369
0:26:52.320 --> 0:26:58.280
One is that there's now a couple of providers like that in the Netherlands and I think they

370
0:26:58.280 --> 0:27:00.720
basically adjust for that.

371
0:27:00.720 --> 0:27:07.400
They would assume that a bunch of their customers do act flexible.

372
0:27:07.400 --> 0:27:13.840
They might have to add a model for that, a behavioral model, economics behavioral and

373
0:27:13.840 --> 0:27:16.040
try to get it right.

374
0:27:16.040 --> 0:27:21.440
On the other hand, I think that some, there's going to be more energy suppliers because

375
0:27:21.440 --> 0:27:27.320
I know of a company in the Netherlands that is basically helping larger companies become

376
0:27:27.320 --> 0:27:28.320
an energy supplier.

377
0:27:28.320 --> 0:27:32.680
So they don't have, it's basically energy supply as a service so you can brand your

378
0:27:32.680 --> 0:27:35.200
own energy supply contract.

379
0:27:35.200 --> 0:27:41.960
And some of the organizations I've talked to think about adjusting their price signal

380
0:27:41.960 --> 0:27:43.360
themselves.

381
0:27:43.360 --> 0:27:47.480
So they buy something on the day ahead market, but that's not the price they give to you.

382
0:27:47.480 --> 0:27:51.400
They give you a different profile to try to sort that out.

383
0:27:51.400 --> 0:28:10.040
Yeah, it could be that you're not doing as much money on the market, but now you add

384
0:28:10.040 --> 0:28:11.040
services.

385
0:28:11.040 --> 0:28:12.040
Let's go on.

386
0:28:12.040 --> 0:28:34.600
I was talking about hardware.

387
0:28:34.600 --> 0:28:44.840
So can you repeat the question?

388
0:28:44.840 --> 0:28:46.840
Do you mean the Everest project?

389
0:28:46.840 --> 0:28:56.880
Well, we are both in Linux energy foundation so we know about each other.

390
0:28:56.880 --> 0:29:00.000
So that would be a way out.

391
0:29:00.000 --> 0:29:01.000
The question.

392
0:29:01.000 --> 0:29:06.600
I haven't found it yet when you did that project that was before our time.

393
0:29:06.600 --> 0:29:07.600
Everything's super new.

394
0:29:07.600 --> 0:29:13.160
And the question was for the audience online that there's the Everest project and they

395
0:29:13.160 --> 0:29:20.120
also have open source hardware, although that's not the core of the company, but they offer

396
0:29:20.120 --> 0:29:22.760
that and they had a great talk this morning.

397
0:29:22.760 --> 0:29:24.400
So that could help, of course.

398
0:29:24.400 --> 0:29:30.560
So that's a great opportunity for the community, for anybody, maybe for us to combine these

399
0:29:30.560 --> 0:29:31.560
two.

400
0:29:31.560 --> 0:29:34.880
I don't know.

401
0:29:34.880 --> 0:29:37.720
Especially young companies have to sprint.

402
0:29:37.720 --> 0:29:38.960
It's difficult.

403
0:29:38.960 --> 0:29:40.880
I want to also get some part of the...

404
0:29:40.880 --> 0:29:42.880
I think we're out of time.

405
0:29:42.880 --> 0:29:44.880
We are out of time?

406
0:29:44.880 --> 0:29:48.840
I'll be answering questions in the chat if there's something burning or right now in

407
0:29:48.840 --> 0:29:52.160
person afterwards in the break.

408
0:29:52.160 --> 0:29:53.160
Thank you.

409
0:29:53.160 --> 0:30:01.120
Thank you.
