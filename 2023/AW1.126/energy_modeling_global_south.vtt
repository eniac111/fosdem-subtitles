WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I think we're good to go, Robbie.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.320
Okay, my name is Robbie Morrison and I'm here to talk about energy system modelling.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.400
I want to take you right up to the stratosphere.

00:19.400 --> 00:24.520
A couple of things on my background, I won't go through all this, but I started climate

00:24.520 --> 00:27.380
campaigning 33 years ago.

00:27.380 --> 00:38.440
I started High Resolution National Energy System Modelling 23 years ago and I started

00:38.440 --> 00:41.880
open source energy system modelling 20 years ago.

00:41.880 --> 00:48.080
So I was right at the beginning of those trends pretty much.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.280
I want to talk briefly about the Open Energy Modelling Initiative, which started about

00:53.280 --> 01:00.520
eight years ago and it's an informal collection of modellers.

01:00.520 --> 01:06.560
We now have about 1,000 people involved.

01:06.560 --> 01:11.720
The bulk of them are early stage full-time researchers.

01:11.720 --> 01:16.700
That gives you an idea of how much interest there is in this open side.

01:16.700 --> 01:21.800
There is an entire parallel universe doing closed modelling that we don't have much

01:21.800 --> 01:28.000
contact with in the power companies, in the World Bank, in the multilateral organisations.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.040
So I'm only going to talk about the open source side.

01:32.040 --> 01:46.040
The final point up here is that this whole field has flipped in the last year, radically.

01:46.040 --> 01:53.680
I get contacted by corporations and economists and so forth now, which would never have happened

01:53.680 --> 01:55.080
two years ago.

01:55.080 --> 01:59.840
So this is a complete game change.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.560
I'm not going to talk very much about energy system modelling, but if you want an introduction

02:03.560 --> 02:10.160
I recommend this YouTube, which is made with my partner in a car park and it's descriptive

02:10.160 --> 02:13.180
and it's quite good.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.800
This is a quick schematic showing what these models can capture.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.720
This just happens to be one that I pulled up that's hybrid with agent-based modelling

02:22.720 --> 02:23.720
in it.

02:23.720 --> 02:31.560
But you see a lot of the entities, if you like, that were being discussed in the previous

02:31.560 --> 02:36.160
talks, but brought together in a collective...

02:36.160 --> 02:41.400
So we have households and we have market operators and we have lines companies and we have markets

02:41.400 --> 02:49.480
and we have AC power flow and we have a lot of kit in the system, hydro system, storage,

02:49.480 --> 02:57.080
gas turbine sets and so forth, and a whole lot of external characteristics coming in

02:57.080 --> 03:02.840
through weather conditions, interest rates and so forth.

03:02.840 --> 03:07.420
So that sort of gives you the broad picture.

03:07.420 --> 03:13.280
If you want to look at the models that exist, this Wikipedia page is worthwhile.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.000
It's about half complete and it covers the various models.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.160
Some are directed specifically to the energy sector, but increasingly they're sector coupled

03:24.160 --> 03:28.640
and they come into the whole energy system.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.880
The basic paradigm is operations research.

03:32.880 --> 03:42.920
So the underlying model produces a set of constraints in a sparse matrix, has a goal

03:42.920 --> 03:49.640
function which is normally minimum aggregate cost and feeds that all into a solver and

03:49.640 --> 03:53.160
returns a result.

03:53.160 --> 03:59.360
The way that the analysis proceeds is by so-called comparative analysis of scenarios.

03:59.360 --> 04:07.760
So you pick a base scenario, a reference scenario and then you propose different scenarios that

04:07.760 --> 04:16.960
you want to explore with nuclear, without nuclear and so on and so on.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.560
These are the high resolution.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.320
They have a lot of detail in them.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.720
So they have the plant and the network and so forth in them.

04:24.720 --> 04:30.280
A lot of external circumstances, weather, demand for energy services and so forth.

04:30.280 --> 04:35.000
They are contiguous time which is really important nowadays because with renewables and storage

04:35.000 --> 04:39.920
you can't kind of do typical periods.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.200
You actually have to work your way through the entire system as it evolves.

04:45.200 --> 04:52.840
That evolution might be out for 30 years, out to 2050.

04:52.840 --> 04:56.480
There's a degree of different types of foresight.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.160
Sometimes it's perfect foresight so we know everything about the future.

05:00.160 --> 05:07.320
Other times it's stepwise so we do recursive dynamics.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.680
Not up here.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.160
Technological progress is included.

05:13.160 --> 05:19.680
One factor, multi-factor, for example, the uptake of a particular technology like solar,

05:19.680 --> 05:27.400
PV, the model will internally reduce the costs for that particular technology as it's taken

05:27.400 --> 05:31.120
up and it evolves through time.

05:31.120 --> 05:36.080
The optimisation is usually mixed integer linear programming.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.720
Anything else more exotic runs into performance issues.

05:40.720 --> 05:49.280
Conceptual extensions include embedded decision taking using agency, multi-criteria optimisation,

05:49.280 --> 05:55.760
some assessment of co-benefits such as urban air quality, sensitivity to the framing of

05:55.760 --> 06:04.360
the problem, the role of uncertainty and the exploration of near optimal solutions.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.080
So this is system modelling.

06:07.080 --> 06:13.360
All systems have kind of natural systems and problems if you like together have natural

06:13.360 --> 06:14.760
boundaries.

06:14.760 --> 06:21.880
If you want to model Europe or you want to model an energy system in Germany you probably

06:21.880 --> 06:26.480
want to go to the boundaries of Europe, for example, because that's kind of a natural

06:26.480 --> 06:29.560
point.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.640
The methods naturally seek technical synergies.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.960
That's one of the advantages of using these systems.

06:37.960 --> 06:46.320
The least cost approach will pick up the synergies and get them working.

06:46.320 --> 06:52.840
Future climate change is normally included, projected future climate change.

06:52.840 --> 06:59.840
These models may exhibit undue sensitivity to both data quality and to system resolution

06:59.840 --> 07:08.080
so they're not without issues that have to be explored by modellers.

07:08.080 --> 07:16.160
They started off with energy systems, electricity systems coupled into district heating, into

07:16.160 --> 07:17.800
gas and so forth.

07:17.800 --> 07:27.080
But they're increasingly branching out into land usage, water use, the industrial sector.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.800
When you're looking at things like hydrogen ammonia, thermal integration and steel production.

07:32.800 --> 07:39.520
Carbon capture is included now outside of the energy system.

07:39.520 --> 07:44.800
So residual emissions from cement and from agriculture are now being included in these

07:44.800 --> 07:45.800
models.

07:45.800 --> 07:52.320
E-mobility also, and we've had some talks about vehicle charging, but this is to look

07:52.320 --> 07:59.720
at the whole picture and not just the perspective of the householder or even the lines company.

07:59.720 --> 08:04.240
Co-benefits beyond climate change mitigation I mentioned.

08:04.240 --> 08:09.360
What isn't in the models is there is no embedded economy.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.780
If you want to do that, then you have to go to process-based integrated assessment models

08:14.780 --> 08:25.720
which are widely used by the IPCC, in which case you have a lot more economic take on

08:25.720 --> 08:29.160
the system.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.760
The model started off being open source, but there are good reasons why we want to look

08:34.760 --> 08:39.640
beyond open source.

08:39.640 --> 08:43.360
The first reason is to go to open science.

08:43.360 --> 08:50.120
So we want genuinely open data and we want under communal curation.

08:50.120 --> 08:54.480
We want full transparency.

08:54.480 --> 09:01.440
As modelers, we want an engaged overarching community so that we can compare and contribute

09:01.440 --> 09:04.560
and support each other.

09:04.560 --> 09:14.440
The goal in my take is that we should be looking at public policy analysis which is based on

09:14.440 --> 09:18.440
peer production, on commons-based peer production.

09:18.440 --> 09:23.920
The reason I say that, and I think there was a talk earlier this morning from the European

09:23.920 --> 09:29.680
Commission, people like the European Commission do not have the capacity to explore the solution

09:29.680 --> 09:37.120
space and I will add, nor do they have the creativity required.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.040
That's not a criticism, that's just an observation.

09:40.040 --> 09:48.160
So we really want a massive effort in exploring what our future could be out to 2050, the

09:48.160 --> 09:54.920
kinds of trajectories and pathways and requirements that are needed.

09:54.920 --> 10:00.640
Some potential for public engagement, but very few examples to date when these models

10:00.640 --> 10:05.640
are used for more specific projects.

10:05.640 --> 10:12.520
Our biggest Achilles heel is complete and coherent data for public interest analysis.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.520
We are not data scientists.

10:14.520 --> 10:20.760
We are desperate to have data which is complete and coherent.

10:20.760 --> 10:31.920
If it's dirty, it's a problem, if the semantics behind the data collection is somewhat inconsistent,

10:31.920 --> 10:33.360
it's a problem.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.360
If the information is missing, it's a problem.

10:35.360 --> 10:41.280
This may not be an issue for our data scientists using statistical techniques or machine learning,

10:41.280 --> 10:47.160
but it is for us.

10:47.160 --> 10:51.800
One issue that doesn't get much airplay are data standards and quite a lot of the data

10:51.800 --> 10:56.000
standards in this area, especially in the electricity sector, are proprietary.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.040
They come under so-called FRAND.

10:58.040 --> 11:04.200
We heard about that, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions.

11:04.200 --> 11:12.280
The problem is, is if the data standards are legally incumbent, then the code bases that

11:12.280 --> 11:20.560
reflect that and the data sets that comply with it could become derivative works under

11:20.560 --> 11:24.000
intellectual property law and we are in trouble.

11:24.000 --> 11:34.160
We want basically CC by 4.0 or something similar on the data standards.

11:34.160 --> 11:39.160
I'll skip the last bit on data sets actually.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.880
I'll skip this slide, but I just want to point out that the situation in Europe is pretty

11:43.880 --> 11:47.040
awful on a number of levels.

11:47.040 --> 11:53.160
Go to the US and you'll find a much friendlier environment for this kind of public interest

11:53.160 --> 11:54.160
information.

11:54.160 --> 11:59.960
Okay, the second part of my talk is about the Global South.

11:59.960 --> 12:06.200
The question is, why is someone who's white, male and old standing here talking about the

12:06.200 --> 12:07.960
Global South?

12:07.960 --> 12:12.600
My short answer is I'm from Aotearoa, New Zealand, and New Zealand became bicultural

12:12.600 --> 12:17.400
over my lifetime and I saw that process and contributed to it.

12:17.400 --> 12:25.800
I had radio programs in the early 90s on sustainability and conservation on tribal radio, on E.B.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.400
radio and so forth.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.840
I went to land occupations.

12:29.840 --> 12:37.840
I organized joint meetings with tribes, Hui they're called, and they take place on Marai.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.920
That's kind of my back story about why I can talk about this I think.

12:42.920 --> 12:51.160
This is a map of Africa with the high voltage network present and you'll see that there

12:51.160 --> 12:54.680
is very little structure there.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.000
South Africa a little more.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.120
David is going to talk a little more about this so I won't.

13:03.120 --> 13:09.240
This is another example of a model called Osmosis.

13:09.240 --> 13:15.800
This is in Africa and these are the cumulative trades out for the next 30 years.

13:15.800 --> 13:20.480
This is the kind of thing that the models are starting to look at.

13:20.480 --> 13:26.600
There are two overarching projects in this area, the Osmosis Global Project.

13:26.600 --> 13:32.720
Osmosis is written in a high level mathematical programming language called MathProg.

13:32.720 --> 13:37.400
The second one is Pipes to Meet Earth which is written in Python and you'll hear a little

13:37.400 --> 13:38.400
bit more about.

13:38.400 --> 13:46.640
One of the interesting things I looked at, Software Heritage collects the forks for a

13:46.640 --> 13:56.720
particular code base and lists 135 fork repositories for Osmosis and 308 fork repositories for

13:56.720 --> 13:58.280
pipes.

13:58.280 --> 14:04.000
That gives you an idea of how the open source world works when people will fork the project.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.800
These aren't hostile forks I presume and use them for their own work and hopefully contribute

14:10.800 --> 14:15.240
their contributions back upstream.

14:15.240 --> 14:22.760
This clear activity now in Central America, Costa Rica, South America, countries like

14:22.760 --> 14:29.960
Brazil, India and surrounding regions, South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.920
Most of this is in the context of academic work.

14:33.920 --> 14:40.960
We have no connection or very little connection crossing over with the multilateral development

14:40.960 --> 14:43.360
organisations and so forth.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.520
This is the parallel universe I mentioned.

14:45.520 --> 14:52.720
How are we doing for time?

14:52.720 --> 15:05.400
One of the issues that we face I think is interacting with official agencies because

15:05.400 --> 15:11.920
we are relatively informal and relatively self-directed.

15:11.920 --> 15:18.400
We also are a competition against the agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency

15:18.400 --> 15:22.600
or IRINO, whoever are doing their own analysis.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.560
I quite like this quote from Oliver Geddon, everyday politics is therefore dominated not

15:27.560 --> 15:33.680
by evidence-based policymaking but by attempts at policy-based evidencemaking and that's

15:33.680 --> 15:37.480
exactly what we want to avoid.

15:37.480 --> 15:42.280
I talked to the incumbent NGOs about using our kind of analysis and they weren't very

15:42.280 --> 15:46.320
interested but I feel quite encouraged now because there are a new set of foundation

15:46.320 --> 15:50.840
backed think tanks who are actually very keen on this kind of stuff.

15:50.840 --> 15:55.560
I'm sorry I can't mention too many names because I was ill for the two weeks prior to this

15:55.560 --> 16:00.160
talk and I didn't get consent to talk about them but a couple of climate analytics and

16:00.160 --> 16:04.040
transition zero.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.520
Some official agencies are starting to talk about open sourcing their stuff but they're

16:07.520 --> 16:15.020
not doing it in a particularly robust way in my opinion and this is a problem.

16:15.020 --> 16:20.560
They will either open, wash or they will do what's called throw their code over the wall

16:20.560 --> 16:24.000
which is put it on GitHub but there's no attempt to develop it.

16:24.000 --> 16:32.680
There are no issues listed and whether it even runs is open to question.

16:32.680 --> 16:40.880
In regards working with the Global South and I had about ten interviews with researchers

16:40.880 --> 16:47.240
in the Global South to try and find out what scopes and issues, their unstructured interviews

16:47.240 --> 16:51.600
but that was kind of interesting.

16:51.600 --> 17:00.000
The clear benefits of open source projects, of course few cost barriers with a caveat

17:00.000 --> 17:04.560
that the commercial solvers can be expensive.

17:04.560 --> 17:14.480
Open license for Garobi might equal three full time researchers in India for example.

17:14.480 --> 17:22.040
There's a soft technology transfer, it's bidirectional, it's lightweight.

17:22.040 --> 17:27.360
All the software projects bundle associated communities and this is I think really a useful

17:27.360 --> 17:31.000
part and the work is transparent.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.200
It can be studied and challenged which I think is really important.

17:36.200 --> 17:43.840
There are some cost cultural considerations I think that are necessary to explore and

17:43.840 --> 17:52.480
I talk about this in Aotearoa and New Zealand becoming bi-cultural but indigenous languages

17:52.480 --> 17:58.760
bundle different concepts and they're quite noticeably different.

17:58.760 --> 18:06.880
Sovereignty is an issue, it's really easy to transgress sovereignty without realising

18:06.880 --> 18:07.880
it.

18:07.880 --> 18:14.440
There's a question of representation, the projects are all pretty much white and male

18:14.440 --> 18:21.360
and the Global North at the moment.

18:21.360 --> 18:29.720
The next question really is also a matter to be traversed is that the framing of the

18:29.720 --> 18:34.800
models and the problems from a Global North perspective may not be very appropriate to

18:34.800 --> 18:39.920
the circumstances in the Global South.

18:39.920 --> 18:45.840
Final slide, challenges, just overarching challenges.

18:45.840 --> 18:54.360
So these won't be very surprising, code maintenance is always a challenge, support for maintainers.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.040
Building a suitable knowledge commons is going to be a real challenge.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.360
For instance the International Energy Agency only sells its data under non-disclosure,

19:03.360 --> 19:08.480
we don't get hold of that although it's collected from our national governments.

19:08.480 --> 19:16.720
The European Union is focused on data commodification through its single digital market.

19:16.720 --> 19:21.440
The scientific institutions are unnecessarily protective.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.440
I talked about cross-cultural issues.

19:24.440 --> 19:28.600
We need to find new ways of interacting with official agencies to get any of this information

19:28.600 --> 19:36.240
into the policy process and I'll just conclude with a quotation from an East German playwright

19:36.240 --> 19:41.480
Heine Muller, optimism is just a lack of information.

19:41.480 --> 19:48.560
Okay, that's it, thank you.

19:48.560 --> 19:56.160
Any questions?

19:56.160 --> 19:59.280
Can you speak up a little too if you ask questions?

19:59.280 --> 20:06.520
Maybe you said the European Union has some issues with open data.

20:06.520 --> 20:11.520
I know that the European Space Agency has a really strong footprint on doing all this

20:11.520 --> 20:17.120
as a Sentinel data stuff, maximum open to drive a new economy.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.920
So has this not spread to the other agencies yet?

20:20.920 --> 20:27.240
The ones I want to mention, and I will mention some names, the Merideth for Future Climate

20:27.240 --> 20:29.880
is under a bespoke licence.

20:29.880 --> 20:40.760
The YASA data on scenarios going forward also under a bespoke licence and so on.

20:40.760 --> 20:48.320
So a lot of the Horizon 2020 projects are also problematic.

20:48.320 --> 20:54.680
The stuff under statutory reporting is also legally encumbered so I can't for the life

20:54.680 --> 21:00.440
of me understand why, but some of it is technically encumbered.

21:00.440 --> 21:08.240
So for example the transparency platform run by NSE is legally encumbered.

21:08.240 --> 21:17.400
The EEX data from the European Energy Exchange also and also technically encumbered.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.960
You can't cut and paste it off the website.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.280
It's not very deep protection.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.920
And we've complained, my friends, to the regulator and they say it's compliant.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.920
Sorry, yeah.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.920
So now I've just got a comment though, which is, I've had a few minutes, you've been

21:33.920 --> 21:39.920
experiencing, for example, in London all the authorities were publishing air quality data

21:39.920 --> 21:44.920
under random crappy licences where they could do stupid things retrospectively.

21:44.920 --> 21:49.040
We've persuaded it to punishment under a UK Open Government licence.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
Another case I've...

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
Open Government licence, UK 3.0.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.040
I don't know which one they're using, this was a few years ago.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.040
Yeah.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.040
And the other decent experience was with Elexon UK balancing where I...

21:59.040 --> 22:07.040
Well, I think I'm their only official agency, but other than that they can tell me to retract

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
everything.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.040
I can use it completely openly, which is quite nice.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.040
So it can sometimes be worse.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.040
I just want to comment on licensing.

22:14.040 --> 22:18.040
The one that, really the only licence that works is CC by 4.0.

22:18.040 --> 22:25.040
If you go to the Open Government licence, UK 3.0, you'll find it's not interoperable

22:25.040 --> 22:28.040
with Creative Commons.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.040
And so you end up with legal data silos.

22:31.040 --> 22:35.040
But still better than 15 random licences written by people who aren't lawyers, right?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
It's still in the improvement.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.040
I know all the licences are written by lawyers.

22:38.040 --> 22:42.040
I can assure you that the lawyers all know what they're doing.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.040
I don't think you saw some of the things they published.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
Okay, okay, okay.

22:46.040 --> 22:52.040
Was there a question up there or no?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.040
Yeah.

22:53.040 --> 23:13.460
Has anyone done any of the IAM

23:13.460 --> 23:14.460
IAMs?

23:14.460 --> 23:20.460
I have a clause in the – remember when Java was proprietary?

23:20.460 --> 23:27.460
And you have to have an open language for a GPL licence.

23:27.460 --> 23:30.460
They use GAMS, which is not an open language.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.460
And I filed a bug report.

23:32.460 --> 23:37.460
And I know personally the lawyer who responded who said it was okay.

23:37.460 --> 23:40.460
Now, look, I'm not an open source lawyer.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.460
I don't know about the textbook.

23:43.460 --> 23:48.460
But that was where that discussion went.

23:48.460 --> 23:52.460
Have you seen any new funding come into this particular field to open things up more?

23:52.460 --> 23:56.460
Because all I know is that in December, I know that the Creative Commons group,

23:56.460 --> 24:00.460
they've started to hire new roles in this specific role

24:00.460 --> 24:04.460
because they landed like a small millions of euros grant for this.

24:04.460 --> 24:09.460
But beyond that, I don't know if there's any other groups starting to do stuff in this field.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
Thanks for answering.

24:11.460 --> 24:12.460
Okay, okay.

24:12.460 --> 24:13.460
Yeah, finished.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.460
No, good question.

24:14.460 --> 24:15.460
Oh, sorry.

24:15.460 --> 24:21.460
The question was funding specifically for open source.

24:21.460 --> 24:27.460
And the sort of short answer is – hang on.

24:27.460 --> 24:32.460
The short answer is that the funding – I'm talking about Germany, let's say –

24:32.460 --> 24:34.460
has been quite good for modelling in general.

24:34.460 --> 24:38.460
And it hasn't been specifically directed to open source.

24:38.460 --> 24:42.460
The high-level organisation, the Open Energy Modelling Initiative,

24:42.460 --> 24:44.460
hasn't needed resources as yet.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.460
But what will happen going forward, I don't know.

24:48.460 --> 24:55.460
But the funders are interested in the kind of open science component of what we do.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
That's quite clear.

24:57.460 --> 25:07.460
And I presume that the next round of funding will start looking for real open source projects to be for support.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
Yeah?

25:08.460 --> 25:14.460
Yeah, so what would you say in all the years of experience has to change?

25:14.460 --> 25:18.460
And how can we push for the change so that we get these open data?

25:18.460 --> 25:24.460
So what are the levers we have to pull with the open source?

25:24.460 --> 25:33.460
In a particular – well, the question was what levers are needed to come to genuinely open data.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.460
It depends on the jurisdiction. In the US it's quite good.

25:37.460 --> 25:41.460
Federal – work by federal employees is public domain.

25:41.460 --> 25:50.460
And there's been enough copyright – litigation around copyright that most of the stuff isn't actually covered – protected by copyright.

25:50.460 --> 25:53.460
They don't have a database directive.

25:53.460 --> 26:02.460
Tracking back to Europe, the only solution I can see is CC by 4.0 as a policy,

26:02.460 --> 26:06.460
which is lightweight, doesn't require legislative change and so forth.

26:06.460 --> 26:13.460
But it does require the European Union to get out of the data commodification.

26:13.460 --> 26:19.460
And I didn't mention it, but there's a thing called the Data Producers Act, which is still live,

26:19.460 --> 26:23.460
which might come back into the Data Act, the proposed Data Act.

26:23.460 --> 26:29.460
And that would be a complete travesty for us, because that would mean all this machine-generated data

26:29.460 --> 26:33.460
would now have its own intellectual property.

26:33.460 --> 26:37.460
And I couldn't think of anything worse.

26:37.460 --> 27:05.460
Okay, yep, thank you everyone.
