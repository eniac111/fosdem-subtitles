00:00.000 --> 00:26.320
So hello everyone. We start with the next project, the next routing project. I'm really

00:26.320 --> 00:32.640
pleased that Janik Vassal came all the way here from Montreal, Canada and is going to

00:32.640 --> 00:39.440
present us transit network planning for everyone. It's a great project to show how a research

00:39.440 --> 00:46.400
project is going into real life and he just, or the project just went open source last autumn.

00:46.400 --> 00:57.920
So we're really excited to see what your project is about. Thank you.

01:02.480 --> 01:07.120
Bonjour, hi everyone. I'm really happy to, I always find a good excuse to come to FASDEM.

01:07.120 --> 01:17.200
So as Melja said, I'm from Montreal. I live in a borough called Verdun, which is still in the

01:17.200 --> 01:23.840
island of Montreal. I'm a little bit far from the subway so I have to rely on buses to get

01:23.840 --> 01:30.480
everywhere on the network. Luckily Montreal is a well grid, it's a grid-based city so it's really

01:30.480 --> 01:36.560
easy to pass bus line about everywhere. But the problem I have every time I try to get the bus,

01:36.560 --> 01:41.360
they all seem to be in sync. Even if I have like three or four lines, I look at the schedule and

01:41.360 --> 01:46.640
there's like no bus available right now. And I ask myself, can I find a way to prove that and ask

01:46.640 --> 01:53.280
the city council or the transit agency, there's a problem there. Luckily a couple of years back,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.760
I started about paying a couple of friends at the Polytechnic University on a software project called

01:59.760 --> 02:07.120
Transition, which is a transit planning tool which is aimed for transit planner at first. But

02:07.920 --> 02:11.520
as much as you want to make a really good tool for transit planner people working in transit

02:11.520 --> 02:17.040
agency, our ultimate goal is to make the tool as easy to use for every citizen, everybody,

02:17.040 --> 02:21.440
to actually solve and understand what are the transit problem and come up with solutions

02:22.160 --> 02:28.000
that everybody can bring. We are really far from that goal but we want to make it as easy as like

02:28.000 --> 02:38.160
your favorite city simulation game. So as I said, we are a research group based in Polytechnic,

02:38.160 --> 02:46.480
Montreal called Share Mobility. It's a mix of transit engineers who studied transit problem,

02:46.480 --> 02:52.400
mobility problem, but we have also other people like we have an economist and we have a few

02:52.400 --> 02:58.560
software folks to help with the software development. Being an engineering school,

02:59.520 --> 03:04.160
we tend to work with applied solutions. So we develop a few tools over the year. We have

03:04.160 --> 03:09.440
evolution, which is a travel survey platform. I'll talk a bit more later. We have a tool for

03:09.440 --> 03:15.760
congestion dashboarding, taxi dashboarding, and the one I'm talking about today, the tool about

03:15.760 --> 03:25.680
transit planning. So if you're a transit professional, your main day job is to actually

03:25.680 --> 03:31.040
draw new lines for your city. There's more analysis to that, but this is the main thing that the tool

03:31.040 --> 03:37.520
will provide you. Give you, you have the map of the city and you can just add new stops, you can

03:37.520 --> 03:46.160
add lines, draw where they go, or you can just import a GTS file for your network or export them

03:46.160 --> 03:53.840
as you go. This is a Brazil. I just imported the old city and can just go and try to work on that

03:53.840 --> 04:01.600
and see where are the problems or what we can improve. We have the concept of a variant or

04:01.600 --> 04:06.880
scenario. So basically you want to do some studies and like maybe exclude some part of the line or

04:06.880 --> 04:12.320
exclude some mode of transportation, like some people only like buses. They just want to take

04:12.320 --> 04:19.680
bus or you will study maybe your network that way. We have a schedule editor

04:21.680 --> 04:28.960
or viewer. Basically you can just sell a schedule, you can edit it. We have a simple addition like

04:28.960 --> 04:32.960
you can tell. I have five bus for this line. It'll just like generate you a schedule,

04:32.960 --> 04:37.760
considering the time to go over the route, the dwell time at every stop and there.

04:38.640 --> 04:45.200
We are not aiming to make a tool to operate the network. Like OSRDB4, it's more tailored to

04:45.200 --> 04:51.200
like actual scheduling of your train in real life. We want to keep it more eye level. Like

04:51.200 --> 04:55.920
what's the idea of the planning? If you are a small city, small transit agency, you can use

04:55.920 --> 05:00.560
that to do your operation. It's simple enough. It will give you some information. If you enter

05:00.560 --> 05:05.280
the schedule, it will tell you how many buses you need so we can give quick estimate. But we will

05:05.280 --> 05:10.800
not consider things like scheduling of staff, maintenance, another issue in there. So we want

05:10.800 --> 05:18.720
to keep it more eye level, at least at this point in time. So the first kind of analysis we do

05:19.600 --> 05:26.400
and like the MODIS project presented before is routing. So basically the same simple problem.

05:26.400 --> 05:32.880
You have a source of destination. We allow you to specify a bunch of parameters to represent

05:32.880 --> 05:37.040
what Felix was talking about. Different kind of needs for different kind of people. Do you want

05:37.040 --> 05:43.040
to do multiple connection or not? Are they older people? Do you want to walk less? Do you want

05:43.040 --> 05:50.160
slower? That kind of things. We can calculate like the best route or we can show you all the

05:50.160 --> 05:56.000
different alternatives. So if you want to go from the ground plus to here at 9am this morning to get

05:56.000 --> 06:02.960
in time, the best option you will give you is the 95 bus. But there was 17 other alternatives that

06:02.960 --> 06:09.120
was like in range to get here in time. We show you transit. We show you walking. We are working

06:09.120 --> 06:17.040
on other modes like cycling or parking ride. There's a lot of complicated problems to combine

06:17.600 --> 06:23.760
network like cycling and ride. There's a lot of difficulty in there. And I'm looking at what do

06:23.760 --> 06:30.880
you do if you can save us some time to do that there. I was talking about variant. I'm sometimes

06:30.880 --> 06:35.840
a bus nub. I take the bus a lot at home. So when I go, especially on this side of the Atlantic,

06:35.840 --> 06:41.440
I try to stick to rails. So I excluded all the buses. And this is like the route, the best route

06:41.440 --> 06:49.760
if I want to keep on metal road. The second kind of allows this really used in transit planning

06:49.760 --> 07:00.880
is the accessibility map. The idea there is to specify a point in the region. And it will show

07:00.880 --> 07:06.640
you the area you can reach in a specific amount of time. In this example, I'll show you from this

07:06.640 --> 07:16.320
place what you can reach in like 15, 30 and 45 minutes. You can specify this area. And the main

07:16.320 --> 07:20.560
interests of the tool, you can do one point at a time. If you want to do a real analysis, you'll

07:20.560 --> 07:26.800
know what to do a lot of them. And that's what the tool provides. Also for the routing part,

07:26.800 --> 07:35.520
you can just upload a file of origin for the accessibility map or origin destination for

07:35.520 --> 07:40.880
the routing. And then you can do real life analysis of all your movement in a day and see

07:40.880 --> 07:47.840
what's best in your network. Every time you will get a bunch of statistics for the accessibility

07:47.840 --> 07:52.800
map, the interesting part is like, on many square kilometers you can reach at a specific time.

07:53.760 --> 08:00.240
If we use the same variant, excluding the bus network, you see you reach a little bit less if

08:00.240 --> 08:05.040
you stick to L. And you have about like 10 square kilometer less. So that's an interesting

08:06.000 --> 08:10.480
thing to analyze. Like if you have some new lines, you do the analysis with the new line

08:10.480 --> 08:15.360
without the line, you compare the result in there. We are currently working on new views,

08:15.360 --> 08:20.640
like to especially do this diff. Instead of having to look at the map yourself, we're going

08:20.640 --> 08:25.520
to show you like, okay, this is the difference between the two analysis that you did and

08:28.000 --> 08:32.240
the statistic difference between those two solutions that you are exploring for your network.

08:32.240 --> 08:42.080
A third analysis that we do, we have a simulation and optimization algorithm. It's based on a

08:42.080 --> 08:46.320
genetic algorithm. So basically the idea, you can provide like your existing network,

08:46.880 --> 08:52.480
add a bunch of new lines or create some random lines in your network. And using some simulated

08:52.480 --> 08:57.840
trips or actual trips, if you have the data there, we'll try to find the best route, the best line

08:57.840 --> 09:04.240
to put in your network to reduce the overall transit time for your population. You can keep,

09:04.240 --> 09:08.320
I have other parameters like I want to keep the cost constant to what I have right now. So I will

09:08.320 --> 09:14.480
not add new trains, new buses, or you can give it like, okay, I have some extra budget. I can do

09:14.480 --> 09:23.440
like 10% more in there. For some of the statistics we studied, we showed that we can, by using that

09:23.440 --> 09:29.680
kind of algorithm, reduce the overall transit time of user by about 15%. Some user will get worse,

09:29.680 --> 09:39.680
but most of the user will have better time. And we did it for real for some cities. This is

09:39.680 --> 09:46.080
Romanville. It's a town about 80,000 people sitting mostly between Montreal and Quebec City.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.200
And they came to us with their actual network. They were like, yeah, it doesn't serve our user

09:51.200 --> 09:58.000
well. We want to have something better. So we just ran the algorithm and give them that. So if you

09:58.000 --> 10:03.840
compare quickly, you see like the same overall idea with the lines. We started with some what

10:03.840 --> 10:11.520
they have, but we explored some space around that. For this case, we draw the line ourselves. We have

10:11.520 --> 10:17.440
a couple of students working on algorithm to just generate new line automatically instead of having

10:17.440 --> 10:23.760
you try to add the new idea there. So this is actually being implemented right now as a new

10:23.760 --> 10:34.880
network for that city. Another real study that we did, there's an idea to add a new subway line

10:34.880 --> 10:41.520
that would go diagonal in Montreal, a project that we called the Pink Line. It might not go,

10:41.520 --> 10:47.600
but there's a lot of ideas floating around. But the city and the government came to us like, okay,

10:47.600 --> 10:52.320
can you show us what would be the impact of adding that line to the city? So basically,

10:52.320 --> 10:59.520
using the batch routing capability of the tool and using actual travel survey data from a previous

10:59.520 --> 11:05.840
study, we were able to simulate all the movement of people with the line and without the line.

11:05.840 --> 11:11.680
And we've seen some interesting result that overall adding that line will reduce transit time

11:12.320 --> 11:18.240
by about 5% for the whole population. Interestingly, we've shown that the people would get the most

11:18.240 --> 11:22.400
benefits from that line would be people who actually use car right now. So hopefully adding

11:22.400 --> 11:30.880
that would shift some mode of transportation from car to some other better transit solution.

11:30.880 --> 11:36.800
This is the overall map of the city with that project and all the currently

11:37.600 --> 11:42.720
projects being constructed in Montreal. And in blue, we show where most people would get at least

11:43.360 --> 11:48.240
a two-minute improvement in their transit in average with a new city.

11:48.240 --> 12:01.440
So how does the tool build? Basically, it's a web application. It's run on Node.js. We mostly

12:01.440 --> 12:06.000
write, we conduct all the code to TypeScript to have at least something that is not too awful to

12:06.000 --> 12:12.960
maintain. A couple of components in surplus plus in Rust. In the backend, we try to move more and

12:12.960 --> 12:18.000
more of the component in Rust just to make improved the maintainability. And it's all running on top

12:18.000 --> 12:27.520
of PostGIS and PostGestQL. For the basic routing, as most people use OpenStreetNet data, we use OSRM

12:28.640 --> 12:37.040
to do the basic route on the road, on pedestrian path. We did modify the basic profile to have

12:37.040 --> 12:43.520
more accurate results, especially for buses in cities. You want to be more accurate because

12:43.520 --> 12:48.080
a bus is not a car. A bus cannot go on every street necessarily or cannot turn as easily as

12:48.080 --> 12:54.160
of the car. So we have some specific mode for that. Same with the motors. We actually are also

12:54.160 --> 13:02.080
looking at Valhalla. Maybe it could give us some improvement in our operation. For the transit part,

13:02.080 --> 13:08.320
we develop a tool car. TR routing. It's a standalone component, also available. We implemented the

13:08.320 --> 13:18.560
connection scale algorithm. Reference the paper there from some people at the

13:18.560 --> 13:22.720
really efficient algorithm. We added a trip base algorithm before, but we used to that. Mostly in

13:22.720 --> 13:28.320
surplus plus at this point. Wanted to convert to Rust, but maybe I can just use motors in there,

13:28.320 --> 13:37.760
that part, and don't have to worry about it. But if we want to do planning, we have to do some data.

13:37.760 --> 13:42.640
Like if you're a transit agency, if you're a city government, you have that already probably. But

13:42.640 --> 13:50.400
if you're a citizen, you need to find that data somewhere. Luckily, most of what we need to do

13:50.400 --> 13:56.000
the planning is available in OpenStreetMap. The basic part of the road network, all the pedestrian

13:56.000 --> 14:03.600
path, rail line, it's mostly all in there. So you can go around, use the SRM, do some quick planning

14:03.600 --> 14:08.480
there. You have everything that you need. If you want to do population simulation and trip base

14:09.200 --> 14:14.000
analysis, you will need to simulate the population. Even there, OpenStreetMap can help us.

14:15.120 --> 14:21.200
If you have all the building drawn on the map, you can extrapolate a little bit your population.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.920
If it's residential building, you know some people will probably live there. You can see where the

14:25.920 --> 14:32.720
population is distributed in the city. And on the other side, if you have the POI, the point of

14:32.720 --> 14:41.040
interest, all the other building, all the shops, all the school, all the industry. So you know

14:41.040 --> 14:46.640
where people usually go in the day. So we can just simulate what is that in our general algorithm.

14:46.640 --> 14:52.640
You actually use that kind of information and just create trips to do the analysis in there.

14:54.640 --> 15:00.080
OpenStreetMap is pretty good, but it's not always good enough for what we need.

15:00.080 --> 15:06.640
We estimate we have to spend a little bit of time validating the data to make sure we have the

15:06.640 --> 15:12.400
accurate result. You can use as is, but you might get error in there. For like a dense urban environment

15:12.400 --> 15:18.880
like Montreal, like Brazil, we spend about 25 hours per square kilometer doing the validation.

15:19.520 --> 15:25.520
For suburban environment, 10, maybe 10 hours per square kilometer in the rural side, maybe a couple

15:25.520 --> 15:30.800
of hours. The good thing is when it's done, then it's done, you just have to make sure new exit

15:30.800 --> 15:39.360
don't break everything, but the information will be there. What we look at when we do the validation,

15:39.360 --> 15:44.400
what are the important things we need? The first part is make sure we have all the link between the

15:44.400 --> 15:49.920
pedestrian network, the cycling network, with the rest of the road network. If you have things like

15:49.920 --> 15:56.400
if you like the tram stop near the ULB, there's a lot of pedestrian path going in and out. If we

15:56.400 --> 16:01.760
didn't have connection well between all those times, the routing algorithm will not be able to just

16:02.560 --> 16:07.600
get you from the tram network to the campus or we'll find a route that goes around. It's really

16:07.600 --> 16:11.520
important to make sure you have all the correct access tag so we have to go look at everything

16:11.520 --> 16:18.560
in that and even add maybe some connection between street to go around in there. We usually

16:18.560 --> 16:23.440
split the sidewalk and the cycling path. I know it's a little bit a debate in the Open Street

16:23.440 --> 16:27.040
Network community, like should you split the sidewalk and just use the sidewalk tag?

16:28.160 --> 16:33.280
But at least for us, we get a really more accurate result if we split the sidewalk.

16:33.280 --> 16:39.440
For Big Street, having a few meters difference between the middle of the road and the sidewalk,

16:39.440 --> 16:46.960
that can be more easy to go around. We also know the quality of the road there. We don't use that

16:46.960 --> 16:51.280
information yet now routing. We want to get there and be able to tell people, yeah, this route,

16:51.280 --> 16:56.080
if you walk on that street, there's a large, large, hard wall. There's streets more fun to walk there

16:56.960 --> 17:04.480
versus some other road. Whenever I plan from my place to the subway, I always take one. Never take

17:04.480 --> 17:08.400
the road that the tool proposed me because it's more fun to go in that other road because there's

17:08.400 --> 17:15.200
shops, there's more life. It's more interesting. The other thing, we will add doors to big buildings.

17:15.200 --> 17:21.520
A big building like a university like that. If we use the center, the center of the building,

17:21.520 --> 17:26.160
we might route you on the other side of the building. If it's a big one, maybe that will

17:26.160 --> 17:31.200
end up being a different bus completely. We need to make sure to know where are the main entrance.

17:31.200 --> 17:38.080
We're going to go and add that big shopping center, things like that, industry, big warehouses.

17:38.080 --> 17:44.880
We're going to spend time just making the street are well aligned. That's the one way out there.

17:45.440 --> 17:50.720
Useful to ride cars and buses. Make sure we have the speed limit. We can consider that in the

17:50.720 --> 17:57.840
transit time of a vehicle. Since we have open street map open, we'll just try to add all the

17:57.840 --> 18:02.960
point of entry that we can find. At least the name and the type that will help the algorithm in there.

18:02.960 --> 18:10.160
We can go further when we have time. We can have reserve line for buses.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.120
We would like to automate a little bit more of that with using MapRulate or the task manager

18:17.120 --> 18:23.200
from the open street community. We are not there yet, but it's going there. For the population,

18:23.200 --> 18:28.400
I've talked a little bit about the OSM building. What we tend to use a lot is the land use register.

18:28.400 --> 18:33.680
A lot of government will provide that for free or at least you can request information to that.

18:33.680 --> 18:38.640
Basically, the information about all the building in a specific area. You would know the building

18:38.640 --> 18:45.520
type. You can find out the population on there or the interest where people want to go in there.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.800
You might want to use the census information that most government will provide. The difficulty

18:50.800 --> 18:58.000
there is the general area is really big. It will often cover multiple blocks in the city.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.800
So, it will cover multiple bus lines or stops. It's going to be hard to find exactly where some

19:02.800 --> 19:08.400
people would come from. We are trying to work on some ideas, some algorithms to spread the

19:08.400 --> 19:14.640
population in some sensible way to be able to simulate based on that. But it's still a work in progress.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.560
Lastly, if you have travel surveys and if you're not familiar with that idea,

19:22.560 --> 19:27.520
most of the agencies will spend time once in a while to just go and ask

19:28.320 --> 19:32.960
most users where they are coming from, where they are going, why they are traveling.

19:32.960 --> 19:38.880
They're going to do that by phone, sending mail, or just stop people on the network and ask them

19:38.880 --> 19:42.400
where they are going. That's really useful information. You can take that and do an exact

19:42.400 --> 19:47.280
simulation of your specific day. But that data is not generally available. If you're a researcher,

19:47.280 --> 19:51.040
you can have access to it. But a general citizen will not have that. That's why we try to get the

19:51.040 --> 19:57.280
population and just simulate that kind of movement there. It will be interesting to know, to get at

19:57.280 --> 20:02.480
some point, if you can, anonymize the information, use the same idea, spread the population somehow,

20:02.480 --> 20:10.960
and make that private free in there. But, yeah, I talked about the evolution tool earlier.

20:12.160 --> 20:18.000
It's a web-based kind of survey platform that can be used for that, which is all the plug-ins to

20:18.000 --> 20:23.600
actually ask people about where they're going, where they're coming from, more specifically from

20:23.600 --> 20:33.360
a date or SurveyMonkey kind of thing. As folks were talking, we also research groups.

20:33.360 --> 20:38.000
So there's a couple of challenges to bring stuff to the real world. How do we make sure

20:38.000 --> 20:44.480
the things we do are actually useful? The first thing would be the code is open source.

20:44.480 --> 20:49.280
As most research, I really strongly believe everything should be open source. And having

20:49.280 --> 20:53.680
trying to get the student to work in the open first would be a good first step. It's not there

20:53.680 --> 20:57.680
yet. A lot of people want to go as fast as they can and just finish their thesis and

20:59.120 --> 21:03.440
give us the code at the end that we have to, as a research professional, do a lot of cleanup

21:03.440 --> 21:08.720
and make sure it works for everybody, but would be a good way. The other thing we do is we make

21:08.720 --> 21:13.680
sure we partner with actual transit agency. Like in Quebec, we work with almost all the

21:13.680 --> 21:18.320
main transit agency for a major city. And we actually have them use the tool, give us feedback,

21:18.320 --> 21:22.640
we sit with them, and ask them what kind of data, what kind of studio you do. And sometimes,

21:22.640 --> 21:27.520
like, we do a batch routing thing and then we take the CSV file and then we do some Excel and then

21:27.520 --> 21:32.080
we do some Python and we're like, okay, what if we just give you a button that would just give you

21:32.080 --> 21:45.040
that and have a quick plug-in to open in QGIS. So we try with those ideas in there. So as I said,

21:45.040 --> 21:51.440
we are far from done. We have currently like 450 open issues. Like, not all bug reports, yeah,

21:51.440 --> 21:56.240
there's some. But stuff like improving the UI, implementing new algorithm, trying to

21:56.240 --> 22:04.320
get integrate some of the tools in there. But yeah, it's a work in progress and we always open to

22:04.320 --> 22:11.600
review pull requests. As for my original problem, so I ran a batch accessibility map, so basically

22:11.600 --> 22:18.320
from my place every five minutes, how far could I reach in the city for like 60 minutes. And I got

22:18.320 --> 22:22.400
this really big association. Like, that kind of showed me there's some kind of a problem with the

22:22.400 --> 22:29.200
schedule. Especially around this 1030 mark where I dip about by almost 15 square kilometers. So I

22:29.200 --> 22:34.240
think, and yeah, I remember every time I tried to go out of the house at that time, which is a good

22:34.240 --> 22:41.520
time to start working, 1030. And there's no bus available. So I think there's a problem there.

22:41.520 --> 22:46.800
It's not highly scientific so far. I'm just like a computer engineer trying to fight myself into

22:46.800 --> 22:54.080
transit engineering. But I think there's a problem there. So that's it. Thank you. If you have any

22:54.080 --> 22:56.400
question.

23:04.160 --> 23:10.720
You've shown us the use of the transition at the state of the city to design and grow new

23:10.720 --> 23:16.960
bus lines, for example. Do you think it would make sense to use that same tool to work at a bigger

23:16.960 --> 23:23.280
scale, for example, drawing train lines at the scale of a country? Would it make sense

23:24.080 --> 23:28.960
to wait transitions? Yeah, so the question is like, doesn't make sense to work at the higher

23:28.960 --> 23:34.640
scale, like country level. I think so. I think right now the performance of the tool might not

23:34.640 --> 23:42.240
be there yet. Like we can think when I do work on Montreal as a world that's starting to like

23:42.240 --> 23:46.640
things getting slow, we are at the limit. So at this point, we are trying to increase the scalability

23:46.640 --> 23:50.880
of that. And we definitely want to go at that level, especially like maybe what depends on the

23:50.880 --> 23:55.040
size of the country, like Canada wide might be a bit too big, but at least province level,

23:55.760 --> 23:57.760
we definitely want to be able to do that.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.760
Okay.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.760
Thank you.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.760
Thank you.

25:27.760 --> 25:36.960
Yeah, it's an interesting comment. And yeah, that's where we want to make the tool for people. But

25:37.600 --> 25:41.840
I know a lot of politicians and I want to make the tool as good for them to actually be able to

25:43.120 --> 25:46.640
try it by themselves and understand the problem. We often have people come to

25:47.200 --> 25:52.000
Catherine, which is the head of the research lab and like they ask them for studies and

25:52.000 --> 25:56.480
but they are not always implemented. But if people can just see for themselves what would

25:56.480 --> 25:59.040
be the improvement that could be interesting in there.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.040
Maybe one last question.

26:01.040 --> 26:09.360
Yeah, very short. You mentioned point of interest people go to and this is the input for the system

26:09.360 --> 26:15.200
to build the route. It doesn't make sense to use the system to solve the dark problem. Okay,

26:15.200 --> 26:20.160
we have existing routes and we want to place the new and special area somewhere. What's the

26:20.160 --> 26:26.160
blank one? What are the best places for that? It doesn't make sense. That's the comment is like,

26:26.160 --> 26:31.280
doesn't make sense to actually sort of like adapting the network to the city. How can we

26:31.280 --> 26:36.960
adapt the city to the network and where can we build new development, a new residential plan,

26:36.960 --> 26:40.880
new residential area. That's a really interesting idea. We never thought of that. But maybe it's

26:40.880 --> 26:45.680
something we can find a way to to implement see where there's potential to develop the city,

26:45.680 --> 26:59.920
maybe an increased density in some places. Thank you for your time.
