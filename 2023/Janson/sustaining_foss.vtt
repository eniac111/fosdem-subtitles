WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
So yeah, today I'm going to be talking to you about sustaining free and open source

00:08.720 --> 00:12.920
software, exploring community, financial and technical practices.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.680
I was trying to go for the longest title possible.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.180
Do you think it's long enough?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.680
Probably greater than longer.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.080
Okay, so my name's Abby.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.520
I do run open source maintainer programs at GitHub.

00:24.520 --> 00:27.220
I'm also an organizer for Sustain OSS.

00:27.220 --> 00:30.760
And I care lots about maintainers, about the open source ecosystem.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.680
So I'm really excited to talk to you about that today.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.500
So before I dive in, I do want to say thank you to all of these names, all these handles.

00:39.500 --> 00:45.200
About a week ago, I tweeted and tweeted about this talk, but also just asking for examples

00:45.200 --> 00:46.960
of sustainable open source.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.440
And all of you really came through.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.320
There was a lot of responses, a lot of things to think about.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.080
And yeah, it really changed how I was thinking of this talk.

00:55.080 --> 00:58.240
So it actually gave me more work, but I think it was worth it.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.720
So you get to hear some insights from all of these people today.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.200
So thanks, especially if your name's up here.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.880
You're the best.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.500
So here's what we're talking about today.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.980
So it is my first time at Fostem.

01:10.980 --> 01:14.120
So yeah, thank you so much to the organizers for having me here.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.920
Yeah, it's been really fun.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.960
I've really been enjoying this conference.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.680
Everyone told me it was going to be really cold.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.360
I think they forgot that I'm Canadian.

01:22.360 --> 01:26.160
This is really nice weather, so it's great here.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.840
So I don't know what I've been talking about.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.900
But yeah, so I do want to share a little bit about myself, my background, and why I care

01:30.900 --> 01:32.980
so much about FOS.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.800
And then we'll go into sustaining FOS.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.280
And spoiler alert, I do think maintainers are a huge part of this.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.000
And then from there, we'll look at those three lenses around how we can be sustainable through

01:43.000 --> 01:46.680
community, through financial, and through technical practices.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.680
So first, some background.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.120
It's a picture of me and my grandma, my Lola.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.040
So my little brother's there.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.280
There are pictures of me and just my grandma, but I really liked this one, even though my

01:57.280 --> 01:58.560
brother is stealing the show.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
I don't know.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
It's fun.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.680
And I like how big my eyes look with my glasses.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.080
It's cute.

02:04.080 --> 02:09.200
But I started my career writing open source software at the Ontario Institute for Cancer

02:09.200 --> 02:10.420
Research.

02:10.420 --> 02:14.280
So this was really meaningful work for me, because my grandmother, my Lola, she had passed

02:14.280 --> 02:15.580
away from cancer.

02:15.580 --> 02:20.360
So this idea that I was helping someone else's grandma, someone else's Lola, was really powerful.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.800
And it was really, yeah, really meaningful work.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.760
But the longer I was in academia, the more I realized how often scientists maybe fudged

02:27.760 --> 02:32.560
their data a little bit or not share parts of their data, just that they can get published

02:32.560 --> 02:36.440
or they can get the best results and get tenure or get that funding.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.700
And this was all happening at the expense of real innovation.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.280
So I was really outraged at that.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.360
That's when I got really into open science, especially using open source and open data

02:46.360 --> 02:48.080
to help us find the best innovations.

02:48.080 --> 02:52.000
Because I do think if we're sharing and we're building upon each other's work, that's how

02:52.000 --> 02:54.160
we'll do the best in the world.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.400
So since then, my career has gone from maintaining open science tools to teaching open source

02:59.400 --> 03:01.020
best practices.

03:01.020 --> 03:04.360
And now at GitHub, I'm supporting the maintainers in this new world.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.640
I started about six months ago, so I'm still a bit new.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
Actually, seven months.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.640
I counted the other day, yeah.

03:08.640 --> 03:13.680
So I'm going to be sharing some of these experiences as we go through the talk.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.120
All right.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.800
So now Sustaining Foss and supporting maintainers.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.840
So I did frame this talk about sustainability, around sustainability.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.440
I think there's a lot of conversation happening in that space.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
I do think it's important.

03:27.440 --> 03:33.000
But after that tweet and the responses I was getting there, I realized I care a lot about

03:33.000 --> 03:37.200
project resilience and how projects are able to survive over time.

03:37.200 --> 03:44.120
So a slight shift, but I think it helped me really think about how are projects resilient

03:44.120 --> 03:48.080
and strong and able to withstand troubles that come their way.

03:48.080 --> 03:54.960
So to me, the biggest factor that affects software's ability to continue is maintenance.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.360
In this changing tech landscape, if something isn't maintained for a while, it will really

03:58.360 --> 04:00.140
quickly become outdated.

04:00.140 --> 04:04.240
So I really like this quote from Toby Longel.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.640
He's an open ecosystem strategist.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.760
And this quote says, in open source, the maintainers working on the source code are the scarce resource

04:11.760 --> 04:13.720
that needs to be protected and nurtured.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
And we're missing a bit of context.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.520
He was talking about the commons.

04:16.520 --> 04:21.000
And I'm a little bit too jet-lagged to have a commons and public good conversation right

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
now.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
But I do think this is an important framing.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.680
I think it's important to be thinking about maintainers.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.160
I know Nadia Egbahl in her book, Working in Public, she also frames this problem as the

04:31.160 --> 04:34.600
resources to maintainers' attention and trying to get their time.

04:34.600 --> 04:39.560
But I really like this framing around the person itself of a maintainer.

04:39.560 --> 04:43.520
And really, what can we be doing to support maintainers so then we are best supporting

04:43.520 --> 04:46.680
resilient open source?

04:46.680 --> 04:50.640
So this aligns a lot with what I've seen in movement building where there's a lot of investment

04:50.640 --> 04:54.760
in raising up new leaders so that the movements can continue.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.080
And we also see this in corporations where people are always like, there's a lot of leadership

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
training.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.400
Like, leaders are really important in communities.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.120
And it's the same for open source.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.960
Maintainers are really important for these communities.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.960
So if we look at supporting maintainers, we're going to look at these three lenses.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.440
And you don't have to address your project with all three of those lenses at once.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.960
I think that's why I made an event diagram.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.040
But we're going to look at these three.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.360
So the first is on the community lens with succession planning.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.920
This one might not be as intuitive, so I'm going to dive into that a little bit more

05:24.920 --> 05:26.320
soon.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.720
The next one in pink is the financial side, so paying maintainers.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.200
And this is what we've heard a lot about lately, getting money to them.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.800
And the third one in blue is on the technical side, making it just easy to use and get started.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.880
So really supporting maintainers by taking away some of the maintainer burden.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.480
But also if a project is suddenly unmaintained, making it easy for someone to just take it

05:47.480 --> 05:50.120
and then run with it.

05:50.120 --> 05:55.200
And then, yeah, just looking at the overlap pieces, say you have like the pink and the

05:55.200 --> 06:01.000
blue, you have the financial piece and the technical piece, but you don't have that community

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
piece.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.600
That's often like corporate open source, especially if they're not really investing in the community.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.000
And I think that's still valid and still fine.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.160
And this way it's okay because they can just pay new maintainers to come on board usually.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.640
So you don't really need all three of them to be completely sustainable.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.440
And then if you have just the green and the blue, so the community side and the technical

06:21.440 --> 06:27.200
side, but not that financial piece, that's like maybe a hobby project.

06:27.200 --> 06:32.720
I also really like how the open source archetypes, they have one, this is a report that was put

06:32.720 --> 06:35.840
out by Open Tech Strategies in Mozilla.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.980
They have an archetype called single maintainer house plant.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.520
So if you're just like a maintainer by yourself, just like watering your little plant, you

06:42.520 --> 06:43.900
don't really need funding.

06:43.900 --> 06:48.240
Funding might actually just hurt the project, but if it doesn't need that much maintenance,

06:48.240 --> 06:49.440
that's also fine.

06:49.440 --> 06:53.760
And then the last piece there, where you have the pink and the green, so you have the financial

06:53.760 --> 06:58.600
piece, you have the community piece, but really it's technically like it's just hard to get

06:58.600 --> 07:01.320
started, hard to use.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.240
That's often specialty libraries where you need like a really deep expertise in something

07:05.240 --> 07:06.500
to get involved.

07:06.500 --> 07:11.060
So those communities tend to have like very few maintainers that are very specialized,

07:11.060 --> 07:14.760
and they're still able to sustain over time.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.720
But they have other pieces to help with that.

07:16.720 --> 07:22.000
And you can probably survive with just one of these three, but I didn't map out all of

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
them.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
It's a lot of things to map.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.400
All right, so the first one we're going to dive into is that succession planning.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.480
It's the community practices.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.820
So I did take this term from the corporate world.

07:32.820 --> 07:37.080
The companies often look at succession planning to make sure that their companies will survive

07:37.080 --> 07:40.120
over long periods of time.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.800
And also you don't need to have this in open source.

07:42.800 --> 07:48.680
Like BDFL is a model that we've seen many successful open source projects with BDFLs.

07:48.680 --> 07:53.200
But I do think that tech is relatively new and open source is even newer.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.960
And that we're only starting to see people retire, or we're starting to see people get

07:56.960 --> 08:00.140
tired of maintaining packages and just delete them all.

08:00.140 --> 08:04.880
So I think we'll be thinking more about succession planning as we're seeing this natural churn

08:04.880 --> 08:08.960
of people go through the ecosystem.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.720
And I did have a conversation after that.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
I am really glad I tweeted about this talk.

08:12.720 --> 08:18.040
I forgot to say, I set a goal earlier at the end of last year to tweet every day.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.840
I just wanted to push myself to do something.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.120
And I would not have tweeted that if I didn't have that goal.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.240
I like to just sort of work on things on my own.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.240
But I'm glad I did that.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.060
So I'm working a little bit more open.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.880
I did have a conversation with Deb Goodkin.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.660
She's the executive director of FreeBSD.

08:33.660 --> 08:37.520
And she pointed me towards this quote from Kirk McKusick.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.480
He's one of the original core maintainers for FreeBSD.

08:40.480 --> 08:46.880
But he says, a successful project has to be able to change the leadership.

08:46.880 --> 08:52.520
Otherwise leadership becomes dead wood, which leaves the project rudderless.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.640
And that was Kirk writing this.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.400
So it's really small on my screen.

08:57.400 --> 09:03.520
He's writing a piece on building and running an open source community, the FreeBSD project.

09:03.520 --> 09:08.680
But I do think this view of succession planning is helpful when thinking about the community.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.960
And it's really helpful for large communities where it can be really overwhelming working

09:11.960 --> 09:13.160
with everyone.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.800
But if you're prioritizing succession planning, then you know where you can have the most

09:17.800 --> 09:20.640
impact for your community in the long term.

09:20.640 --> 09:26.200
So an example I'll talk about, I think the easiest way to bring in succession planning

09:26.200 --> 09:30.040
is when you're selecting who to mentor in your project.

09:30.040 --> 09:36.000
So I like to suggest these three criteria so that you're selecting people who are most

09:36.000 --> 09:39.420
likely to become leaders within your project.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.120
So first is mission aligned.

09:41.120 --> 09:44.400
They actually care about this work and want it to succeed.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.960
So I know you've probably seen many people come to your project that are more extractive.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.800
They don't care as much about the mission, but they just want something from the project.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.720
They just want to get something out of it.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.480
It's still good to have them in the community, you can still welcome them.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.800
I just wouldn't invest a ton of time in them if you're mentoring people.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.600
So first, make sure they're mission aligned, they're there because they actually want the

10:03.600 --> 10:06.520
project to be there long term.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.520
Second, available.

10:07.520 --> 10:12.640
Do they actually have the time and resources to contribute?

10:12.640 --> 10:15.560
And it's great that we have these mentorship programs where they can get paid for their

10:15.560 --> 10:19.360
time so this does open the door for more people.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.000
But if someone really wants to be part of this project but then they don't have the

10:23.000 --> 10:27.880
time, I wouldn't also invest that time into mentorship unless they get that time or unless

10:27.880 --> 10:32.560
you get the funding to help support their time or whatever is needed there.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.920
And then the third one there is willing to learn from whoever is mentoring them.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.120
So you might notice I didn't put skills needed.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.320
I know some projects will add skills as a different set of criteria, but I think it's

10:43.320 --> 10:47.520
much easier to find someone who's just willing to learn those skills that they need.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.280
And there will be a lot of project knowledge that you'll need to transfer onto them as

10:51.280 --> 10:55.320
a new maintainer.

10:55.320 --> 10:59.520
But I would add anything that you really can't be taught you can put there.

10:59.520 --> 11:03.120
Yes, I think that's what I had for this slide.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.120
All right.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
So I'm going to look at its case study.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.720
So this is work that I did at Mozilla.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.000
I was running Mozilla Open Leaders.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.680
And each of these dots is a project that went through our training process.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.760
And yes, it was a mentorship program.

11:15.760 --> 11:20.240
So when they entered, they had to apply and we would give them questions based on that

11:20.240 --> 11:22.000
criteria I shared before.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.520
So the mission for this program was really about strengthening open projects and communities

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
around the world.

11:28.520 --> 11:32.120
So we'd ask some questions around like what does openness mean to you or why do you want

11:32.120 --> 11:36.640
to work open to see if they were the mission aligned or did they just come to get some

11:36.640 --> 11:37.880
training.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.240
We asked questions around like what do you hope to learn from a mentor?

11:41.240 --> 11:42.880
How do you learn best?

11:42.880 --> 11:47.280
And then also made sure that they understood like, hey, we want 10 hours of your week each

11:47.280 --> 11:50.760
time and really setting those expectations.

11:50.760 --> 11:56.480
So by setting those expectations, we set quite a high bar for people coming through.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.880
But I think if we hadn't set that and we were just getting people who maybe wanted to be

12:00.880 --> 12:04.520
mentored, they may not have been willing to give that 10 hours.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.240
But setting them up front like lifted that bar.

12:07.240 --> 12:12.320
So you got more people that were really excited about the mission and like wanted to help.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.320
Yeah.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Oh, yeah.

12:14.320 --> 12:19.240
So then doing that really helps with some incredibly high retention rates.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.940
So especially at the beginning, you'll see the orange dots are the people that came back

12:22.940 --> 12:23.940
and mentored others.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.000
So they actually did become leaders within the community.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.920
So our retention rate was as high as 85% in the early days.

12:30.920 --> 12:37.520
It gets lower as you scale because it is harder to keep that quality up over time.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.320
And then even after the program finished.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.220
So we did spin down this program.

12:41.220 --> 12:46.120
We spent one more round decentralizing it and just working with past graduates to run

12:46.120 --> 12:49.340
10 community led projects.

12:49.340 --> 12:53.800
And many of those are still running today and they continue to mentor hundreds of students,

12:53.800 --> 12:56.280
not students, projects a year.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.620
And when I last checked, they've collectively raised over a million dollars from funders

13:00.620 --> 13:03.120
like NASA and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.320
And I haven't checked in about a year, so it might be more now.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.280
But it's exciting just to see, even though I wasn't running this anymore, this mission

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
was still going on.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.200
There's people still learning about open source in their fields.

13:15.200 --> 13:20.280
And I was going to make one more slide with all the people doing this, but I was very

13:20.280 --> 13:23.720
tired today when I was making slides, so I didn't make one for that.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
Okay.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
All right.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
So succession planning.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.440
So just a couple of notes.

13:29.440 --> 13:33.240
Adding a selection step and criteria will really help you prioritize who you're going

13:33.240 --> 13:34.840
to invest time in.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.360
And you just can't mentor everyone.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.840
There's a lot of people that will want your attention in an open source project, but this

13:40.840 --> 13:46.000
is a nice way to sort of filter so that you're prioritizing for the long-term success of

13:46.000 --> 13:48.620
your project.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.440
Another place where succession planning can be helpful is when you're thinking about FOSS

13:52.440 --> 13:56.000
that's incubated at a company or corporate open source.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.520
So if especially if there's open source happening at a company that's not part of the core business,

14:03.520 --> 14:07.800
it might be time to think about where that project will go next in terms of succession

14:07.800 --> 14:08.800
planning.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.840
So a couple examples, maybe that will spin out into foundation.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.880
So an example is the Rust project.

14:13.880 --> 14:19.720
So that was at Mozilla for a very long time, but they spent out there at the Rust Foundation.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.800
Or a partner with other companies for shared governance.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.080
So the example I put there was Kubernetes, which was at Google, but now it's part of

14:26.080 --> 14:27.240
the shared infrastructure.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.840
So a lot of the big tech companies have the shared governance over this shared infrastructure

14:32.840 --> 14:35.800
that they all use.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.480
Okay.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.240
Next circle was the pink one.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.240
Pay maintainers.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.440
Yay.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.240
So some financial practices.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.720
Oh, yeah.

14:44.720 --> 14:50.240
I'm a huge fan of GitHub, I work at GitHub.

14:50.240 --> 14:54.320
But a lot of times when a project joins a foundation, you won't necessarily get money

14:54.320 --> 14:56.320
directly to the maintainers.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.880
You'll get a lot of support and ecosystem support, but I am so glad that there's companies

15:00.880 --> 15:06.160
like this and products like this, like GitHub sponsors, like, thanks, Deb, they're here.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.160
Yay.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.320
StackAid, open source collective, Tidelift.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.360
There's so many different groups just helping money get directly to maintainers, which is

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
amazing.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.560
And I'm glad we're seeing so many of them.

15:16.560 --> 15:21.560
I actually saw this tweet from Dustin Dorfman this morning when I was still making my slides.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.920
He wrote, if you told me ten years ago we would have multiple businesses building services

15:26.920 --> 15:29.920
to help sustain open source projects, I would have been skeptical.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.720
Can't imagine the next ten.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.240
So I completely agree with Justin.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.360
It's great seeing so many of these.

15:36.360 --> 15:41.160
So just to share a little bit more about GitHub sponsors, there's this explore page.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.360
So if you go there, you'll see the projects that your account depends on and which ones

15:46.360 --> 15:50.840
are eligible for sponsorship to make it a little bit easier for you to sponsor projects.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.960
And one of the first projects that I worked on when I joined GitHub was this maintainer

15:54.960 --> 15:59.520
month sponsorship where we had half a million dollars and we distributed that to across all

15:59.520 --> 16:03.360
of our dependencies just evenly across everyone who had sponsors turned on.

16:03.360 --> 16:08.880
So it's really fun seeing everyone get there like 500 bucks as part of maintainer month.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.280
And that's going to be part of the actual product soon.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
So bulk sponsorships are coming out.

16:13.280 --> 16:17.120
So it'll be much easier for you to just upload a list of maintainers that you want to give

16:17.120 --> 16:22.600
money to and then it'll spread it out.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.240
And then just a little bit more about paying maintainers.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.320
The funding landscape has changed dramatically in this past year or so.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.440
There's far more money available in open source.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.720
So the open source collective saw a 30% increase in payment to maintainers.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.520
And there's a lot more emphasis on securing the supply chain, especially after the Biden

16:39.520 --> 16:45.300
administration's announcement with that executive order on improving the nation's cybersecurity.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.160
And then this is an NSF grant and the pathways to enable open source ecosystem.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.960
There's just so much more money going into open source.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.120
I only highlighted like two of them there.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.820
There's a lot.

16:55.820 --> 17:01.920
So it's great that money's there, but how do we actually set projects up in a way that

17:01.920 --> 17:04.040
will give ongoing support to maintainers?

17:04.040 --> 17:09.520
And this is a really complicated question, especially if there's multiple maintainers

17:09.520 --> 17:13.240
on a project, like how do we do this equitably, which maintainers get paid?

17:13.240 --> 17:15.120
I'm not going to answer that here.

17:15.120 --> 17:18.320
Again, I'm far too jet-lagged for that.

17:18.320 --> 17:24.460
But we do have some models that I think we can follow and we can learn from that seem

17:24.460 --> 17:27.800
to work for supporting certain types of open source projects.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.080
I am really excited for the GitHub accelerator.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.040
I think they're gearing up for their first cohort right now.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.840
Applications closed at the end of last year.

17:34.840 --> 17:39.160
But talking to Nathan, she's really interested in seeing these new models arise.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.080
But I'm going to talk about just three models that we have today.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.080
I grouped a few things.

17:44.080 --> 17:47.640
I don't know if you can tell, but I'm a really big fan of the rule of three.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.100
So I will tell you things in threes.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.340
But the first is tips and donations.

17:52.340 --> 17:58.600
So this can be going to an individual or the donations to be going to a foundation.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.920
The second is getting hired at a company to do open source.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.360
And this is when the project is not governed by that company.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.580
It's governed outside.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.640
But they're paying you to do open source.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.560
And then the third one is that the company actually does open source and they're governing

18:11.560 --> 18:12.560
it.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.420
And then you're part of helping that.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.960
So I'm going to go through these three and talk about some examples and sometimes when

18:17.960 --> 18:21.120
it works really well and maybe doesn't.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.760
The first one with the tips and donations, yeah, again, it can be to a foundation or

18:24.760 --> 18:26.120
an individual.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.400
This works really well for visible projects.

18:28.400 --> 18:35.360
View is an example that's gotten a lot of sponsorship and donations.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.540
But Evan is really good at that marketing.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.560
And View is a project that many developers use.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.240
It's very top of the stack.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.240
It's not really hidden.

18:44.240 --> 18:49.840
So people make the cognitive decision to use View, which helps make them make a decision

18:49.840 --> 18:52.040
to sponsor View.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.840
The second is content creators.

18:53.840 --> 18:58.040
Caleb Porzio has written a lot about how he's able to sustain a career just on GitHub

18:58.040 --> 18:59.880
sponsors' donations.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.920
And a lot of that is he's creating content around the open source that he's building.

19:03.920 --> 19:08.160
So it's more of that Twitch stream model where people are excited.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.800
And he's a really good marketer, I think.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.640
So it's great that people are able to work like that.

19:13.640 --> 19:19.680
I also don't think that an open source maintainer has to also be a marketer.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.240
There has to be a way that we can get money to those people that don't naturally have

19:23.240 --> 19:26.480
Caleb's gift for marketing.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.960
And then the third is maintainers in lower cost of living areas.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.120
So I actually interviewed COVID Goil.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.080
I'll go to the next slide.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.120
So here's a little clip.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.440
So I interviewed COVID Goil and Carlos Becker.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.600
COVID maintains Caliber and Carlos maintains a GoReleaser.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.040
Yousafiktor was also in this panel.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.560
But he didn't talk about this topic.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.560
He's there.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.200
But if you watch it, you can see him.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.480
But both of them agreed that the strength of the US dollar really helped.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.120
So Carlos was in Brazil, COVID's in India.

19:57.120 --> 20:02.200
And COVID was saying, like, by moving from the US to India, he was actually able to sustain

20:02.200 --> 20:04.040
himself full time on the open source donations.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.660
He actually has a really cool story.

20:06.660 --> 20:11.480
He talked about how when he was in grad school, his parents would give him some pizza money.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.440
And then something happened with a credit card.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
And it stopped working.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.160
So he was like, oh, what if I just turn on sponsorships?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.320
This was before sponsors existed.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.320
So he just turned on like a little PayPal donate button on Caliber.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.880
And he started getting sponsorships.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.160
And people started donating.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.440
And then he was able to have that pizza money that grew to be a little bit more than pizza

20:30.440 --> 20:31.440
money.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.560
And then when it came time, when he and his wife both finished grad school, and they were

20:35.560 --> 20:39.180
thinking about what to do next, COVID was like, oh, maybe I can just do this full time

20:39.180 --> 20:41.200
because they were going to move back to India.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
And he was able to.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.520
So I think that's a really cool story, just how certain products are able to survive off

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
of donations.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.680
But I'll say it's a little tricky.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.680
All right.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.680
The second one is getting hired at a company to do free and open source software.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.640
So this is a great way for a company to have a direct line to the project where they actually

21:01.640 --> 21:04.680
are paying for a maintainer to work on it.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.280
And it's great for the project to just have maintainers stably employed.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.880
So the example I put here was, this is Keely Hammond.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.440
She works at Slack.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.500
And she's an electron maintainer.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.360
And I like this Read Me project piece on her.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.360
So I encourage you to go read it.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.960
But she just talks about being an electron maintainer and working at Slack and just how

21:22.960 --> 21:26.560
she's bringing in more of these non-code contributions.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.720
And we see this model happen a lot.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.920
I think electron is just the one that I'm highlighting here.

21:31.920 --> 21:37.280
But you do have to depend on that company to continually be sponsoring these folks.

21:37.280 --> 21:42.420
And the third one is that the company does free and open source software on their own.

21:42.420 --> 21:45.080
So there's a few ways.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.760
This is a very sparse slide I'm just realizing.

21:47.760 --> 21:52.080
So if it's part of their core business model, I think Next.js and Vercel is a great example

21:52.080 --> 21:56.680
of this, where Vercel sells the hosting services so that it's just really easy for you to deploy

21:56.680 --> 21:59.680
your Next.js apps.

21:59.680 --> 22:03.960
And then I also grouped consulting services as part of this company does fast.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.440
I know some people consult individually.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.620
But a lot of people set up a company to do the consulting.

22:08.620 --> 22:13.440
So companies will hire you for your expertise on that project.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.280
And then you can sustain yourself that way.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.360
So again, from the Twitter thread, the Janus or Yannis, I didn't learn how to pronounce

22:20.360 --> 22:25.240
that, the WebRTC server, they're able to sustain themselves through this consulting

22:25.240 --> 22:27.640
business.

22:27.640 --> 22:32.800
And that works when you're, again, when you're high enough on the stack that people will

22:32.800 --> 22:35.480
realize they're using you.

22:35.480 --> 22:40.440
All right, so yeah, just an overview of what we talked about.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.400
These are the three models that I think work today.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.920
But I still think we need more models.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.120
I know talking to Nathan with that GitHub accelerator, she likes to ask that question,

22:51.120 --> 22:54.200
where is the Etsy model for open source?

22:54.200 --> 23:00.960
Where are the people who just create and then are able to get paid for doing that?

23:00.960 --> 23:04.080
It's hard with open source because software isn't a thing that you can just take.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.160
I'm hoping that this accelerator will help us explore that question and maybe try to

23:08.160 --> 23:10.560
figure out a nice model for that.

23:10.560 --> 23:16.280
All right, and that third lens was the technical practices.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.240
Just make it easy to use and get started with your project technically.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.760
Again, this helps maintain a burden.

23:21.760 --> 23:26.040
Maintainers won't have to walk you through getting your environment set up and everything.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.160
But also, yeah, if the project is suddenly unmaintained, ideally someone can just pick

23:30.160 --> 23:33.200
it up and go.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.400
So a few things, best practices.

23:36.400 --> 23:42.200
The first three I actually took, I was consulting with the UNICEF venture fund.

23:42.200 --> 23:46.660
This is actually a requirement for people to graduate from their incubator.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.000
They need to have documentation for everything.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.840
They need to have greater than 80% code coverage for tests and they have CICD involved.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.980
And then the cloud developer environment, just making it easy for people to get started

23:59.980 --> 24:02.360
without having to figure out their local machine.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.760
I think makes a big difference.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.200
Okay, so we're going to go through each of these again.

24:08.200 --> 24:16.080
With documentation, I know I already coded Kirk McKusick, but when I asked Deb, what

24:16.080 --> 24:21.080
did FreeBSD do really well early on that led to where it is today?

24:21.080 --> 24:25.680
And Kirk's response, he gave me a huge list, but one of them was emphasized documentation

24:25.680 --> 24:26.920
from the start.

24:26.920 --> 24:32.000
So making sure you're documenting things, really important.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.640
The next piece for testing in CICD, again, it's just so much easier for people to come

24:36.640 --> 24:39.040
in and contribute to your code if there are tests.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.840
They can realize when something's broken.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.160
It's easier for you as a maintainer to know when you can merge something in or when you

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
shouldn't.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.740
And then this is just a little gift showing how nice it is to have this all integrated

24:50.740 --> 24:57.400
using GitHub actions where everything's just all there together with your code.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.200
And then the last one, that cloud developer environment.

24:59.200 --> 25:03.520
I think Codespaces has been really nice for this.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.680
And you can just use the green button.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.400
We missed it in the animation.

25:07.400 --> 25:11.440
But then it launches this cloud IDE and then you're just writing the code right away.

25:11.440 --> 25:16.200
And now that Codespaces is offering 60 hours free every month for each individual, this

25:16.200 --> 25:20.660
is a great way for people to start coming into your project.

25:20.660 --> 25:24.040
And I was going to bring some of these business cards so you can talk to Craig.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.640
So Craig, he loves open source.

25:26.640 --> 25:32.000
Again, I am jet-lagged and I forgot these business cards at this event venue for later

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
today.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.160
But you can take a picture of this if you want to talk to Craig.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.720
That's the link.

25:37.720 --> 25:43.220
And he's more than willing to help you get Codespaces set up so that individuals can

25:43.220 --> 25:45.400
just come to your project and get started quickly.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.720
All right.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.880
So just an overview.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.240
Supporting maintainers through these three lenses.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.880
For the community side, there's succession planning.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.200
From the financial side, paying them.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.320
From the technical side, making it really easy to use and get started.

26:01.320 --> 26:07.720
So if you are interested in any of these conversations at Sustain, I am one of the Sustain OSS organizers.

26:07.720 --> 26:12.100
We do have a conversation every other Friday where we talk about topics like this.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.560
So a lot of the information I got was from those conversations.

26:14.560 --> 26:19.240
So you can go to Sustain's discourse over there.

26:19.240 --> 26:23.040
But I also I run GitHub's open source maintainer program.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.920
So if you want to talk about this with other maintainers, we do have a private maintainer

26:26.920 --> 26:30.600
community that we're just relaunching some new programming.

26:30.600 --> 26:36.100
So if you go there, you can request an invitation to the community and get involved.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.720
So huge thanks to everyone.

26:37.720 --> 26:40.400
I really appreciate being here.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
You can find me.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.880
I'm Abby Kabs on GitHub and Twitter.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.960
I'm also on Mastodon.

26:44.960 --> 26:55.800
And yeah, thank you so much for having me.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.240
I'll now take questions.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
Thank you, Abigail.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.400
We have questions for Abigail.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Just raise your hands.

27:02.400 --> 27:06.920
I can get the mic to you.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.960
As I was preparing, I was like, oh, this will be easier if I have a long question period.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.760
But now I'm realizing I'm really tired.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.080
So please be nice to me with your questions.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.080
Hi.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.080
Hi.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.620
Thanks for the talk.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.680
So you are talking about ways to become a maintainer.

27:24.680 --> 27:33.480
There is another way that you don't talk about, which is working at a company and then convincing

27:33.480 --> 27:39.240
your CEO to open source, for example, your core business.

27:39.240 --> 27:48.320
And so if I was CEO of a company, how would you convince me to switch to open source?

27:48.320 --> 27:49.320
Oh.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.320
All right.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.320
Yeah.

27:51.320 --> 27:55.000
So you're saying that the other way to survive as open source project is to convince your

27:55.000 --> 27:57.800
company to run an open source business.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.800
Indeed.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
Yeah.

27:59.800 --> 28:02.240
So I think there's a lot of advantages to working open.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
I've talked about them before.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.200
I don't have them all written here.

28:05.200 --> 28:10.640
But big ones is better products when you have a diverse community contributing, especially

28:10.640 --> 28:15.600
if your company isn't representing the diversity of the audience that you're working for or

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
serving.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.320
Having that, that's good.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
Reduce production costs if you're sharing it across a big group.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.600
And also reduce support costs.

28:25.600 --> 28:30.000
Often if your company is, if your community is answering each other's support questions,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.160
that's another way for reducing costs.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.440
And what's the other one?

28:35.440 --> 28:41.380
Oh, also, if you want to be a de facto standard or if you want to be a platform by giving

28:41.380 --> 28:46.700
something away for free, more people adopt it and then you can become that platform.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.860
So we see that with Android.

28:49.860 --> 28:54.840
So those are a few of the reasons I'd give off the top of my head, too.

28:54.840 --> 28:59.480
But it would depend a lot on what company I'm talking to and what their priorities are.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.440
And it's tricky to find a good business model that works with open source, but when you

29:03.440 --> 29:06.480
do, it's beautiful.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
Thanks a lot.

29:07.480 --> 29:15.040
What would you answer to someone saying I'm not going to open source my code because I

29:15.040 --> 29:18.600
fear that people will be stealing it?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.720
Sorry, could you repeat?

29:20.720 --> 29:23.600
You don't want to open source your code because?

29:23.600 --> 29:28.520
People would be stealing it and copying basically your product.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.760
Oh, because you don't want it to be copied?

29:30.760 --> 29:31.760
Yeah, exactly.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.760
You don't want it stolen?

29:32.760 --> 29:35.120
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.160
You could license it less permissively.

29:37.160 --> 29:42.120
Instead of someone copies it, they'll have to license it the same way.

29:42.120 --> 29:45.000
You're answering really tough, you're asking tough questions.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.080
I asked for easy ones.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.520
But no, this is important.

29:49.520 --> 29:56.200
I say, yeah, you have to structure your business in a way where it doesn't matter if someone

29:56.200 --> 29:57.360
takes your code.

29:57.360 --> 30:03.040
So the example I gave with Next.js and Vercel, anyone can take that, anyone can run it and

30:03.040 --> 30:10.400
do it themselves, but they're selling the server time and that computing time.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.560
So it doesn't matter to them if it gets copied.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.920
But I don't know.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.440
Copying stuff, that's more innovation.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.040
It's better for the world often.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.040
Thank you.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.160
Thanks a lot.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.880
Any easier questions?

30:22.880 --> 30:32.520
There's a couple.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
You're next.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.520
Hi.

30:34.520 --> 30:39.560
Do you think GitHub itself will be open source in the future?

30:39.560 --> 30:41.840
Do I think GitHub itself will be open source in the future?

30:41.840 --> 30:45.440
I know that, is this recorded?

30:45.440 --> 30:48.480
Yes, it is.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.440
I'm sure it's fine if I say this.

30:50.440 --> 30:55.480
I know with Thomas Stomkey, he's the CEO of GitHub, he said in the past, what's stopping

30:55.480 --> 30:59.720
us if we open source GitHub right now, we just wouldn't be able to handle all the contributions

30:59.720 --> 31:01.240
and all the community coming in.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.640
I think that's one of the big reasons why they're not doing it.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.400
I wouldn't rule it out, maybe eventually.

31:07.400 --> 31:13.400
But yeah, our business model doesn't really, yeah, it's the code itself, it's not there.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.360
It's more the hosting and the CI CD, code spaces, things like that, where they're generating

31:17.360 --> 31:18.360
the revenue.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.920
I think like, oh, pilot now, yeah.

31:20.920 --> 31:21.920
Thank you.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.920
Thanks.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.920
Hard questions again.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.160
I hope it's okay, I said.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.240
I'm sure no one will report me.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.680
Oh, this person was next.

31:29.680 --> 31:30.680
Okay.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.680
After that.

31:31.680 --> 31:32.680
Okay.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.680
Hi.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.440
Thanks for the talk.

31:36.440 --> 31:42.280
What would be your approach of sustaining a conference app like the Fostem one, which

31:42.280 --> 31:51.280
is only available for a weekend and then people do other things over the year and, yeah, like,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.240
how do you go about this?

31:53.240 --> 31:55.440
How would I go about sustaining a conference like Fostem?

31:55.440 --> 31:58.840
I think Fostem has done a really good job sustaining itself.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.200
It's grown so much.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.600
8,000 people.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.560
It's just amazing to see the community come together and people get really excited about

32:04.560 --> 32:07.880
it.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.720
I don't know if I'd do anything that much differently.

32:10.720 --> 32:15.560
I think from what you said with how it happens only once a year, are you thinking about,

32:15.560 --> 32:18.640
like, keeping people engaged through the year?

32:18.640 --> 32:23.280
Then I might start doing more online things in between us touch points or having more

32:23.280 --> 32:29.440
local things so people can have their Fostem in their city, the local meetups, just to

32:29.440 --> 32:31.240
keep people engaged over time.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.520
But I don't know.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.560
Fostem seems to be going really strong unless there's something I don't know.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.560
Yeah.

32:37.560 --> 32:38.560
Yeah.

32:38.560 --> 32:48.120
Thank you so much for your great talk.

32:48.120 --> 32:53.360
I was a little bit surprised when you mentioned in the discussion about how to sustain a project

32:53.360 --> 33:00.600
financially that there was the case example of a person that moved to India and was able

33:00.600 --> 33:03.920
to sustain itself by working on Foste, which is fantastic.

33:03.920 --> 33:11.080
But you used the word surviving, which seemed a little, yeah, it just surprised me because

33:11.080 --> 33:16.360
I think everybody can agree that people that maintain full-time Foste projects, which is

33:16.360 --> 33:23.960
the infrastructure of a lot of the world, of IT really, should be, well, we all hope

33:23.960 --> 33:30.360
that one day we'll be able to pay these people a reasonable salary for their efforts and

33:30.360 --> 33:31.360
not just surviving.

33:31.360 --> 33:37.440
Now, with that said, like you say, it's tricky to find business models that can financially

33:37.440 --> 33:39.280
sustain these projects.

33:39.280 --> 33:43.200
And GitHub is a company that has done so much for open source and plays such an important

33:43.200 --> 33:48.120
role and it also has enabled a lot of funding to start to arrive to maintainers.

33:48.120 --> 33:56.240
Now, do you think that GitHub is now done finding new ways to find, like, new models

33:56.240 --> 34:03.040
to sustain developers or is the conversation with GitHub still open where we could, you

34:03.040 --> 34:08.480
know, provide further feedback and provide novel ideas to tackle the business model of

34:08.480 --> 34:10.360
how to tackle the problem?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.400
Is GitHub open to new ideas?

34:12.400 --> 34:15.440
Yes, GitHub is open to new ideas.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.280
Actually join that private maintainers group.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.360
I think that would be a really interesting avenue to have those kinds of conversations.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.680
And I think a lot of those, one of the big reasons why the GitHub Accelerator was set

34:24.680 --> 34:28.440
up was to help us try to find these models and better ways to pay people.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.200
Like you said, I probably shouldn't have used the word surviving.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.600
It's nice that COVID was able to do that.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.360
But that shouldn't have to be the norm.

34:36.360 --> 34:42.360
There's no way we could make all the open source maintainers live in India.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.360
I'm true.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.360
It's nice there.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.120
But, yeah, there has to be a better way that we can actually sustain these people.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.560
So I think there's still a missing link.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.560
So I think you've identified there's still this missing piece.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.400
And I don't really know the answer.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.840
There are people having these conversations.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.880
And we're definitely open to hearing your thoughts.

34:58.880 --> 34:59.880
Thank you very much.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.880
I have a question.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.880
Oh, yeah.

35:01.880 --> 35:08.400
Yeah, you did talk about, I just have, my question would be a follow up, like similar

35:08.400 --> 35:14.240
to what he just said about the financial maintenance of open source practitioners.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.080
So like, do you guys have a mechanism?

35:16.080 --> 35:21.400
How do you do, determine, how do you reward somebody that is doing, like that is maintaining

35:21.400 --> 35:23.960
an open source platform?

35:23.960 --> 35:26.960
How do you determine how much he should be rewarded?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.720
Sorry, what was the question?

35:28.720 --> 35:32.760
Like how do you, how do you determine how much should someone be rewarded?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.160
Oh, how to determine how much someone is worth?

35:35.160 --> 35:36.160
Yeah.

35:36.160 --> 35:41.000
How he's rewarded, like for his, for his involvement in an open source project.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yeah.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.320
Because like, for example, you might think like, you have two people from different locations,

35:47.320 --> 35:49.080
all contributing the same amount of hours.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.080
Yeah, yeah.

35:50.080 --> 35:54.000
And you might be receiving different paycheck at the end of the month.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Yeah.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, no.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.400
And I think just the question for everyone, how do you, like if you have multiple maintainers,

36:01.400 --> 36:03.360
how do you know how much money should go to each person?

36:03.360 --> 36:06.600
And I think that's a really big question today.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.760
And I wasn't prepared to answer that in this talk.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.920
But I think, no, I've definitely heard of some projects where like one person is maybe

36:13.920 --> 36:16.600
in India, the other person's in North America.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.920
And then if they pay them evenly, the cost of living is so different.

36:20.920 --> 36:21.920
It just causes issues.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.880
Or like if one person started the project and they're still getting paid but they're

36:24.880 --> 36:28.320
not an active maintainer anymore, like what happens there?

36:28.320 --> 36:29.760
There's a lot of open questions like that.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.880
And I think that really depends on the project.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.080
It really depends on the project governance and dynamic.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.920
It's really, it's a human, human problem.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.920
Yeah.

36:37.920 --> 36:38.960
But I agree.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.240
That is a big problem today.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.400
And it's a big problem for open source.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.400
How much time do we have?

36:45.400 --> 36:46.720
Okay.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.040
Okay.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.840
So this might be the last question, I think.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
Yeah.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.840
I'll come here.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.840
Yeah.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.840
Hi.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.840
I'm a member of several organizations.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.080
And we are dealing with, in all of them, we are dealing with the same problem.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.600
We have new members coming in every year.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.400
And there is nobody to give them orders, basically.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.800
They would be very happy to help.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.480
But nobody tells them how.

37:09.480 --> 37:14.160
How can we get these people who are basically acting as middle managers for these organizations?

37:14.160 --> 37:15.520
Oh, man.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.520
Yeah.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.200
So if you're in an organization, you have new people coming in, but then no one is telling

37:19.200 --> 37:21.440
them what to do and how to help.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.200
I think that's where establishing mentors is really important.

37:25.200 --> 37:32.800
And just like finding people in your community already that's willing to onboard others.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.320
So that's why I really like programs like GSOT, Google Summer of Code.

37:36.320 --> 37:41.200
Because it's good for bringing in the newcomers, but it's also good at like finding mentors

37:41.200 --> 37:42.240
in the community.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.840
And this might be the first time they're stepping up in leadership.

37:44.840 --> 37:48.360
So that's a nice incentive because they get a little bit of a kickback from Google also

37:48.360 --> 37:50.240
for mentoring.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.480
And they get like the mentor summit and things like that.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.080
So yeah.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.520
I would think about it that way.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.840
What can you do to encourage mentors?

37:58.840 --> 38:00.600
It might be making a role for it.

38:00.600 --> 38:05.280
It might be giving them special titles and giving them some fancy thing.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.280
I don't know.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.280
A special dinner.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.760
Depends on what your community likes.

38:08.760 --> 38:09.760
Thank you.

38:09.760 --> 38:10.760
Cool.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.360
I think that's all for time.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.960
I'm around.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
So you can come chat with me.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.120
I did bring stickers and buttons.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.120
So you're welcome to come up here and get some.

38:20.120 --> 38:24.480
I have slightly less than I had for my talk this morning where I accidentally gave far

38:24.480 --> 38:25.640
too much away.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.240
But this is how much is here.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.240
So thanks everyone.

38:29.240 --> 38:45.120
I'll be chatting with you.
