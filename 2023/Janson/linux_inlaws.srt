0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.820
Good afternoon. Are you ready? Martin, how many times did I tell you not to sedate the

2
0:00:12.820 --> 0:00:17.500
audience when we give a presentation? I think this was a marketing ploy, wasn't it? At least

3
0:00:17.500 --> 0:00:23.580
we get some customers. Let's try this again. Are you ready? Much better. Welcome to our

4
0:00:23.580 --> 0:00:28.380
presentation on Linux in Oz. This is Oz? More like a talk than a presentation because

5
0:00:28.380 --> 0:00:37.840
there's only one slide. This is us. If you like knowledge or madness, either is good.

6
0:00:37.840 --> 0:00:47.680
Welcome. Just out of curiosity, how many people of you listen to podcasts? Very good. Pretty

7
0:00:47.680 --> 0:00:57.200
much everybody. Wow. How many people have heard prior to this gig about Linux in Oz?

8
0:00:57.200 --> 0:01:13.360
Your listeners are here. This is all planned. Ah, yes. Did you win the bet by any chance?

9
0:01:13.360 --> 0:01:18.180
Because Martin now just bought officially the bet. How many people have listened to

10
0:01:18.180 --> 0:01:27.080
one of our episodes prior to the presentation? This one gets the bottom up. After the presentation,

11
0:01:27.080 --> 0:01:34.240
please collect your prize. Indeed. Well done, that man. On with the show. Thank you all

12
0:01:34.240 --> 0:01:39.720
for coming. Today is really about getting an idea of what our podcast is like, which

13
0:01:39.720 --> 0:01:47.840
is generally very free flowing and well prepared. Maybe before we go into the details, maybe

14
0:01:47.840 --> 0:01:54.600
we should introduce ourselves more formally. Yes, I'm Chris. I'm Martin. Actually, it's

15
0:01:54.600 --> 0:01:59.840
the other way around. This is Martin. My name is Chris. You want to say something about

16
0:01:59.840 --> 0:02:08.160
you? Sure. Some of you may know that we've been doing some IT stuff for a bit. Chris

17
0:02:08.160 --> 0:02:15.480
is retired now. He does it as a hobby. This is us. Martin has about 20 years of international

18
0:02:15.480 --> 0:02:24.320
arms trade, drug trafficking and other professional activities on this. My name is Chris. I have

19
0:02:24.320 --> 0:02:33.200
been using open source for the last 30 plus years. I also run a lot in Germany, the La

20
0:02:33.200 --> 0:02:41.120
Frankfurt have been doing community events for ten years. About three years ago, but

21
0:02:41.120 --> 0:02:45.480
more about that in a minute, we decided to start this podcast. Martin, what did you do

22
0:02:45.480 --> 0:02:52.320
prior to the podcast? Prior to the podcast. Like yourself, I've been in IT since the year

23
0:02:52.320 --> 0:02:58.840
dot. Messing around with PDP 11s and all that kind of stuff. If anybody knows where that

24
0:02:58.840 --> 0:03:04.360
is. In short, we've been around for quite a while and been playing with open source

25
0:03:04.360 --> 0:03:11.600
software, which you will hear all about today. Exactly. We should probably say where we actually

26
0:03:11.600 --> 0:03:19.960
met the first time. We can do. Probably in a bar somewhere. We did. I was working at

27
0:03:19.960 --> 0:03:24.840
a company called Redis. Redis, if you're watching this on the stream, the email response is

28
0:03:24.840 --> 0:03:32.120
at Linux.inlaw.in case. This is where we met. Martin decided to join that NoSQL database

29
0:03:32.120 --> 0:03:40.000
company. This is basically where we met about three years, four years ago. You're forgetting

30
0:03:40.000 --> 0:03:48.480
COVID on you. Something like that. We were doing technical sales at the company. Now

31
0:03:48.480 --> 0:04:00.560
on with the history of the podcast. It is November 2019. Yes. A rainy cold Prague. What

32
0:04:00.560 --> 0:04:05.840
even was the event? The event was actually said kick off. Ah, yes, of course. Of course.

33
0:04:05.840 --> 0:04:09.720
Or business review. I can't remember. Who knows? You know, some corporate nonsense.

34
0:04:09.720 --> 0:04:19.040
But, yes, out of that was some craft beer places visited. And where we discussed all

35
0:04:19.040 --> 0:04:25.320
things open source between us. Indeed. Martin was choking on hot check wings. And so was

36
0:04:25.320 --> 0:04:30.960
I. And after a few beers, basically, we both discovered that, yes, we were heavily into

37
0:04:30.960 --> 0:04:36.240
open source. And we always had this intention of doing a podcast. And then we said, why

38
0:04:36.240 --> 0:04:42.720
not do it together? And actually the first episode that was published in 2020, in February

39
0:04:42.720 --> 0:04:50.360
of 2020, actually is aptly named, or the second episode is aptly named Fostem. Mostly I talk

40
0:04:50.360 --> 0:04:56.880
about 2020 Fostem. You went there at the time. I did, yes. I gave a presentation in the Rust

41
0:04:56.880 --> 0:05:24.440
Dev Room on

42
0:05:24.440 --> 0:05:33.120
a format that we both like. As in, discuss topics like operating systems, Rust, programming

43
0:05:33.120 --> 0:05:39.200
languages, stuff like that. And in between that, we do various interviews of people that

44
0:05:39.200 --> 0:05:45.640
are notable in the open source community. The format is loosely modelled on something

45
0:05:45.640 --> 0:05:52.320
called Floss Weekly. I don't know if that rings a bell. Twit TV is the publisher. But

46
0:05:52.320 --> 0:05:56.720
they do weekly shows with just interviews. And the idea that we had at the time when

47
0:05:56.720 --> 0:06:04.240
we originally devised the podcast to share the episodes between knowledge, transfer for

48
0:06:04.240 --> 0:06:15.320
one, or for better expression. But also, livening up the whole format with actually interview

49
0:06:15.320 --> 0:06:22.760
guests. It took us some time to come up with the exact format. It was also loosely based

50
0:06:22.760 --> 0:06:30.040
on, as the name says, some of you may have recognised Linux Outlaws. That was a podcast

51
0:06:30.040 --> 0:06:38.400
a while ago that had a similar kind of format, right? Almost. Who of you knows Linux Outlaws?

52
0:06:38.400 --> 0:06:48.080
Ah, okay. About 15 years ago, Fab and then Lin Shet, Fab Shetter and Lin Shet, the idea

53
0:06:48.080 --> 0:06:55.120
of actually doing a weekly format, talking just about current events. Something that

54
0:06:55.120 --> 0:07:00.880
we started with, too. Yeah, we did that, didn't we, for a while. But with the delay between

55
0:07:00.880 --> 0:07:06.320
publishing and talking about current events, it wasn't that relevant. Because the podcast

56
0:07:06.320 --> 0:07:11.760
came out three months later. Exactly. Go ahead, man.

57
0:07:11.760 --> 0:07:17.640
Yeah, this brings us to where we started as well. Our podcast was first on Hacker Puppy

58
0:07:17.640 --> 0:07:23.600
Radio, which you may be familiar with as well. They have a booth.

59
0:07:23.600 --> 0:07:35.080
They do? Well, Ken has a booth called Free in Culture Podcast. And this is what we use

60
0:07:35.080 --> 0:07:43.920
originally to bootstrap ourselves. That was actually, I spoke to Ken at Fostem in 2020,

61
0:07:43.920 --> 0:07:49.920
and he said we're more than happy to bootstrap you in terms of host you to get initially

62
0:07:49.920 --> 0:07:55.360
off the ground. And that's exactly what we did before we changed this, but more on this

63
0:07:55.360 --> 0:08:01.200
in a minute. Yeah, so for anybody thinking of doing a podcast,

64
0:08:01.200 --> 0:08:06.600
it's very easy to get started. We have an episode on this as well. We do, yes, we do.

65
0:08:06.600 --> 0:08:13.040
So yeah, personally, I like the interviews. I don't know about yourself, but we have some

66
0:08:13.040 --> 0:08:19.120
quite very good guests in the past that we've had, which you may know as well, like the

67
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:24.600
likes of a recent one we had, Ran Levy from... Malicious Life.

68
0:08:24.600 --> 0:08:31.880
Yes. So we had various people supporting open source, like the FSFE.

69
0:08:31.880 --> 0:08:37.000
Which is actually in the audience. In the audience, indeed. And we had various

70
0:08:37.000 --> 0:08:44.040
people on programming languages, operating systems.

71
0:08:44.040 --> 0:08:50.600
We yes. For those of you who are becoming interested, we do have a back catalog. The

72
0:08:50.600 --> 0:08:57.800
website is linnesilnows.eu. For example, we had a kernel maintainer panel. We did the

73
0:08:57.800 --> 0:09:03.000
same with BSD, of course. Program language panel, yes.

74
0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:07.400
Yeah, program language panel and all the rest of it. So the idea is basically to get people

75
0:09:07.400 --> 0:09:14.520
on the podcast, and not just one, ideally, but more than one, and talk about projects,

76
0:09:14.520 --> 0:09:19.080
political issues, that sort of thing. Political issues. Is there a particular episode

77
0:09:19.080 --> 0:09:23.400
you're thinking of from the Georgia...? Yes. We have the Electronic Frontier Foundation

78
0:09:23.400 --> 0:09:27.000
on the podcast, but also, of course, the Free Software Foundation Europe.

79
0:09:27.000 --> 0:09:32.200
Yeah, it's well worth a listen, that one. As is the one by Paul Ramsey. Do you remember

80
0:09:32.200 --> 0:09:36.920
that one? Vaguely, remind me. I mean, we've been doing almost 80 episodes by now.

81
0:09:36.920 --> 0:09:42.360
Yeah. So Paul Ramsey is a post GIS maintainer. I don't know if you... Does any of you

82
0:09:42.360 --> 0:09:48.120
familiar with Postgres? Well, no, post GIS. But he's also very much a speaker on things

83
0:09:48.120 --> 0:09:54.280
open source. And he kind of raises a lot of points around open source is free and available,

84
0:09:54.280 --> 0:10:01.160
but you get just a few people maintaining it. So there should be more funding for open

85
0:10:01.160 --> 0:10:06.920
source contributors in a way, but specifically in government, right? Because government uses

86
0:10:06.920 --> 0:10:13.640
a lot of open source software. But they're not actually contributing, and the code should be

87
0:10:13.640 --> 0:10:18.760
free as well. Things like that. So we had a lot of discussions about this. True. Yes.

88
0:10:20.280 --> 0:10:27.080
I think it's fair to say that we keep a... Or we try to keep a well balanced middle ground

89
0:10:27.080 --> 0:10:30.520
between technical stuff and also political stuff. Yeah, that's a good point, actually.

90
0:10:30.520 --> 0:10:34.600
That's probably fair to say. But it's about raising that profile as well, right, for

91
0:10:36.280 --> 0:10:41.480
open source and the people that make that software. This is part of what we want to do.

92
0:10:41.480 --> 0:10:46.360
Absolutely. And this is basically why we came up with the podcast in the first place.

93
0:10:46.360 --> 0:10:50.840
Yep. All those years ago. Well, all three of them.

94
0:10:53.080 --> 0:10:58.600
So having said that, we do bi-weekly episodes, right? So it's quite a busy schedule.

95
0:11:00.680 --> 0:11:08.040
And yeah, we also made between a topic and an interview. Now, we should probably mention

96
0:11:08.040 --> 0:11:12.840
something called the dark side, Martin. The dark side. Do tell. Yes.

97
0:11:14.760 --> 0:11:20.520
Martin and myself, when we set out doing the podcast, we had this idea of providing a little

98
0:11:20.520 --> 0:11:25.480
bit of color to the podcast. So you've been sort of a bit of a dark color.

99
0:11:26.760 --> 0:11:32.760
Exactly. So who knows something called the bastard operator from hell, B-U-F-H?

100
0:11:32.760 --> 0:11:41.960
Okay. Martin, this is nodding okay. Fair enough. No, the B-U-F was, I think, about a

101
0:11:41.960 --> 0:11:51.320
formula about what, 20 years ago? Maybe less, maybe more. That's where actually a system

102
0:11:51.320 --> 0:11:54.200
administrator talks about his trials and tribulations. Let's put it this way.

103
0:11:55.080 --> 0:12:00.120
And so we took this original idea and the dark side is loosely modeled on the bastard operator

104
0:12:00.120 --> 0:12:06.920
from hell, but turned this into a much more comedy oriented format. Let's put it this way.

105
0:12:06.920 --> 0:12:10.920
Yeah, for sure. It's a bit of dark humor. Let's put it that way.

106
0:12:11.880 --> 0:12:16.440
And yeah, these are also the only parts that are scripted in the podcast.

107
0:12:16.440 --> 0:12:19.560
Yes. Good point. Good point. Everything is normally very ad hoc.

108
0:12:20.520 --> 0:12:27.720
It's free flow. Normally, we do these dark sides bits and pieces as part of a Halloween special,

109
0:12:27.720 --> 0:12:30.280
for example. Halloween, Christmas, Easter.

110
0:12:31.960 --> 0:12:37.320
Any other religious holiday you may want to talk about? Do you want to talk about

111
0:12:40.120 --> 0:12:42.840
Duchess Vladessa, maybe? Some teaser?

112
0:12:44.040 --> 0:12:49.240
Well, okay. So we have this, you're particularly talking about the Halloween one, right?

113
0:12:49.240 --> 0:12:49.960
Yes.

114
0:12:49.960 --> 0:12:55.880
Those of you who have heard this one, we have a yearly Halloween episode where various, we have

115
0:12:55.880 --> 0:13:05.240
a friend of ours who participates and does a very good, let's say, female vampire impression.

116
0:13:06.040 --> 0:13:07.240
If that's possible on the podcast.

117
0:13:08.120 --> 0:13:10.120
Yeah, actually she's from Macedonia, right?

118
0:13:12.440 --> 0:13:18.840
And there, essentially, she's our voice model. She's our voice actress.

119
0:13:19.640 --> 0:13:24.920
And mostly, these Halloween episodes, of course, have a Halloween topic.

120
0:13:24.920 --> 0:13:30.520
So essentially, the episode that I was referring to, and again, we normally do these kind of

121
0:13:31.320 --> 0:13:37.320
round Halloween, that sort of thing, refers to the tribulations that a certain Transylvanian

122
0:13:37.320 --> 0:13:44.200
Duchess encounters when her workforce decides to unionize. It's that sort of black humor,

123
0:13:44.200 --> 0:13:48.920
and I won't give away too much. You have to listen to the episode. It's that sort of black humor

124
0:13:48.920 --> 0:13:56.120
that drives the dark side, in addition to kind of, and the people basically who...

125
0:13:56.120 --> 0:13:59.080
Slightly more serious subjects in other episodes.

126
0:13:59.080 --> 0:14:04.440
And apart from the humor that is woven into the interviews, into the other sessions.

127
0:14:04.440 --> 0:14:12.280
Definitely, definitely. On that subject, clearly, we make this podcast, well, partly for ourselves

128
0:14:12.280 --> 0:14:17.320
because we have a bit of fun making it, but it's clearly aimed at listeners.

129
0:14:17.320 --> 0:14:22.520
So we have many ways for people to provide feedback.

130
0:14:22.520 --> 0:14:23.320
Yes.

131
0:14:25.320 --> 0:14:26.120
Carry on.

132
0:14:26.120 --> 0:14:32.520
The email address is, of course, feedback. But since we should probably talk about the hosting aspect, too.

133
0:14:32.520 --> 0:14:33.320
Yes.

134
0:14:33.320 --> 0:14:37.320
We publish normally on archives.org, so if you have an archives.org account,

135
0:14:37.320 --> 0:14:40.120
you can also leave a comment and leave feedback there.

136
0:14:40.920 --> 0:14:43.720
We do not do Twitter for obvious reasons.

137
0:14:45.720 --> 0:14:46.520
Yes.

138
0:14:46.520 --> 0:14:50.520
No, we haven't done Twitter any time...

139
0:14:50.520 --> 0:14:50.920
No, no.

140
0:14:50.920 --> 0:14:55.320
...from the making of the podcast because never mind the population of recent.

141
0:14:55.320 --> 0:15:02.520
We started on HBR for a long time, right? And only recently, kind of, on other podcast media,

142
0:15:02.520 --> 0:15:04.520
you'll be able to find us on most of those.

143
0:15:04.520 --> 0:15:10.520
Yes. Of course, when we were still on Hacker Public Radio, we... You could leave comments on Hacker Public Radio, too.

144
0:15:10.520 --> 0:15:10.520
Yes.

145
0:15:10.520 --> 0:15:18.520
And, I mean, these comments are very important to us, really, aren't they? It's something that, yeah, the more feedback we get, the more they...

146
0:15:18.520 --> 0:15:24.520
Exactly. I mean, yeah, the podcast is done for you listeners, not for us.

147
0:15:26.520 --> 0:15:30.520
And certainly not for our sponsors, because we don't have any...

148
0:15:30.520 --> 0:15:38.520
No. What we also do is actually we also invite people from other podcasts on the podcast.

149
0:15:38.520 --> 0:15:44.520
For example, the Linux Lads, if Shane or anybody else, or Conan is here, but I don't see them.

150
0:15:44.520 --> 0:15:48.520
Also, but we should also probably talk about the Grumpial Coders, right?

151
0:15:48.520 --> 0:15:56.520
Grumpial Coders, yes. Another set of podcasters that have a... Well, not a similar format, but they have...

152
0:15:56.520 --> 0:15:58.520
Yeah, they're more on the technical side, by the way.

153
0:15:58.520 --> 0:15:59.520
Yes.

154
0:15:59.520 --> 0:16:05.520
And they publish less frequently. But it's, again, it's some friend of ours that we occasionally have some banter with.

155
0:16:05.520 --> 0:16:06.520
Exactly.

156
0:16:06.520 --> 0:16:07.520
Yeah.

157
0:16:07.520 --> 0:16:13.520
Yes. What else is there to talk about Linux, about Linux in-laws?

158
0:16:13.520 --> 0:16:15.520
Well, you should listen to it. That's the main thing.

159
0:16:15.520 --> 0:16:16.520
Yes.

160
0:16:16.520 --> 0:16:18.520
Yeah.

161
0:16:19.520 --> 0:16:22.520
So, why should you listen to Linux in-laws, right?

162
0:16:24.520 --> 0:16:25.520
That's your cue.

163
0:16:25.520 --> 0:16:32.520
Why don't you ask the question? You put the word Spotty Martin. Well, why would you listen to the Linux in-laws?

164
0:16:32.520 --> 0:16:33.520
Well, I...

165
0:16:33.520 --> 0:16:34.520
If you wouldn't be making it.

166
0:16:34.520 --> 0:16:42.520
Personally, yeah. It's mainly because we do intermix the detect stuff with a bit of fun, right? That's the main thing.

167
0:16:42.520 --> 0:16:52.520
And personally, I like the interview pieces generally very much because you get so many people from different parts of the world, from different projects,

168
0:16:52.520 --> 0:17:02.520
and they all have clearly an open source link, but they all have different stories to tell about open source and why it's good, and their part in it, really.

169
0:17:02.520 --> 0:17:03.520
Very true, yes.

170
0:17:03.520 --> 0:17:05.520
How about you?

171
0:17:05.520 --> 0:17:09.520
Well, I've been doing open source for the last 30 plus years, so...

172
0:17:09.520 --> 0:17:11.520
This is why you run an Apple Mac.

173
0:17:11.520 --> 0:17:12.520
Teets.

174
0:17:12.520 --> 0:17:17.520
But as we all know, underneath is a well-hidden BSD system, right? So, no worries.

175
0:17:17.520 --> 0:17:20.520
Do we not have an upcoming episode on Tuxedo computers?

176
0:17:20.520 --> 0:17:27.520
We do. But I don't think they're listening, so it's not worth mentioning that as a sponsor. No worries.

177
0:17:27.520 --> 0:17:28.520
That's a little teaser there, yeah.

178
0:17:28.520 --> 0:17:29.520
No worries.

179
0:17:29.520 --> 0:17:50.520
But no, because we touch on our... subjects that move people in terms of open source is more and more used across industries, countries, planets.

180
0:17:50.520 --> 0:18:01.520
Whoever has a mobile phone running Android, but also running iOS, is essentially running open source software. Android is powered by Linux, as probably most of you know,

181
0:18:01.520 --> 0:18:09.520
and beneath the iOS is something called BSD, both widely used open source operating systems.

182
0:18:09.520 --> 0:18:10.520
Yes.

183
0:18:10.520 --> 0:18:19.520
And I reckon with doing Linux in-laws, we are providing a platform for projects to voice themselves, to make themselves heard.

184
0:18:19.520 --> 0:18:30.520
These are not just Linux subjects, right? We also, as mentioned, touch other parts of open source, whether it's software and hardware, occasionally.

185
0:18:30.520 --> 0:18:31.520
And politics.

186
0:18:31.520 --> 0:18:32.520
Politics, yes.

187
0:18:32.520 --> 0:18:35.520
Society topics and all the rest of it, yes.

188
0:18:35.520 --> 0:18:43.520
Yeah. Not to mention, yeah, the showering situation in Germany is a common topic.

189
0:18:43.520 --> 0:18:46.520
Yeah, I mean, we normally reckon... we normally open with a little bit of humor.

190
0:18:46.520 --> 0:18:55.520
I normally slag off the United Kingdom and Martin returns these jokes with dire descriptions of the situation in Germany.

191
0:18:55.520 --> 0:18:56.520
That's probably fair to say.

192
0:18:56.520 --> 0:18:57.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
0:18:57.520 --> 0:18:59.520
So, yes.

194
0:18:59.520 --> 0:19:09.520
So, yeah, if you want to... no, in short, Linux in-laws, you want to learn a little bit, you want to listen to people that have things to say about open source.

195
0:19:09.520 --> 0:19:12.520
And you like a bit of fun, just come and listen to us, really.

196
0:19:12.520 --> 0:19:14.520
Absolutely, yeah.

197
0:19:14.520 --> 0:19:17.520
That is the... well, what's our slogan, by the way?

198
0:19:17.520 --> 0:19:21.520
You come for the knowledge but stay for the madness.

199
0:19:21.520 --> 0:19:27.520
This is something that marketing came up with before you fired them, right?

200
0:19:27.520 --> 0:19:28.520
Marketing? What is marketing?

201
0:19:28.520 --> 0:19:30.520
The department that you can fire them up.

202
0:19:30.520 --> 0:19:32.520
Is that the people that make the t-shirts?

203
0:19:32.520 --> 0:19:35.520
No.

204
0:19:35.520 --> 0:19:37.520
So, who makes the t-shirts?

205
0:19:37.520 --> 0:19:42.520
The people with graphic design capabilities, I suppose.

206
0:19:42.520 --> 0:19:44.520
Fair enough, fair enough.

207
0:19:44.520 --> 0:19:46.520
No, we should talk about the logo, actually, no?

208
0:19:46.520 --> 0:19:48.520
We can talk about the logo, yes, yes.

209
0:19:48.520 --> 0:19:50.520
Oh, how many stickers have you brought, actually?

210
0:19:50.520 --> 0:19:56.520
Yes, you can find stickers, actually, at the Free Culture Podcast booth.

211
0:19:56.520 --> 0:19:58.520
I didn't have any footer listeners here.

212
0:19:58.520 --> 0:20:00.520
I do, only about four or five.

213
0:20:00.520 --> 0:20:02.520
You'll find the rest, actually, at the booth.

214
0:20:02.520 --> 0:20:04.520
This is a prototype.

215
0:20:04.520 --> 0:20:05.520
Yes.

216
0:20:05.520 --> 0:20:07.520
Very rare, very rare.

217
0:20:07.520 --> 0:20:08.520
Like the t-shirts.

218
0:20:08.520 --> 0:20:09.520
The first batch, yes.

219
0:20:09.520 --> 0:20:14.520
So, the logo, Martin, why did we need a new logo?

220
0:20:14.520 --> 0:20:20.520
Well, mainly because the previous logo was based on some pictures of us 20 years ago.

221
0:20:20.520 --> 0:20:22.520
True, true, true.

222
0:20:22.520 --> 0:20:24.520
It's not that representative anymore.

223
0:20:24.520 --> 0:20:30.520
But, yeah, certain podcasts, let's say, publishers also didn't like the format, so...

224
0:20:30.520 --> 0:20:32.520
So, we had to change this.

225
0:20:32.520 --> 0:20:37.520
And after about 20,000 focus group sessions, quite a few...

226
0:20:37.520 --> 0:20:39.520
This is without Martin.

227
0:20:39.520 --> 0:20:41.520
Debates, exactly.

228
0:20:41.520 --> 0:20:43.520
Quite a few debates.

229
0:20:43.520 --> 0:20:47.520
Debates, various sessions.

230
0:20:47.520 --> 0:20:55.520
We came up with a new logo, which I hope you will find on most podcasting platforms also.

231
0:20:55.520 --> 0:21:02.520
By the way, yeah, although Ken is not the audience, I think we should probably talk about metrics.

232
0:21:02.520 --> 0:21:04.520
Okay, go ahead.

233
0:21:04.520 --> 0:21:08.520
Metrics in terms of basically how many people listen to us.

234
0:21:08.520 --> 0:21:12.520
Well, metrics, but actually we had done some metrics in the room today, so we could...

235
0:21:12.520 --> 0:21:13.520
Yeah, about what?

236
0:21:13.520 --> 0:21:18.520
150, maybe 180 people in the room.

237
0:21:18.520 --> 0:21:26.520
We host our episodes, our MP3s, now on arkaf.org.

238
0:21:26.520 --> 0:21:31.520
And the download stats for an average fun episode,

239
0:21:31.520 --> 0:21:41.520
just on that platform alone, clocked in between 2,500 downloads per episode.

240
0:21:41.520 --> 0:21:45.520
But if you type Linux in-laws into your search engine of choice,

241
0:21:45.520 --> 0:21:48.520
you come up with a syndication left, right and center.

242
0:21:48.520 --> 0:21:51.520
Or even your podcast app of choice, right?

243
0:21:51.520 --> 0:21:52.520
Yes.

244
0:21:52.520 --> 0:21:58.520
So, it's probably fair to say that on average we are listened to by more than 8,000 people per episode,

245
0:21:58.520 --> 0:22:00.520
give or take a few.

246
0:22:00.520 --> 0:22:01.520
Yes.

247
0:22:01.520 --> 0:22:03.520
Unfortunately, they don't all feedback, do they?

248
0:22:03.520 --> 0:22:05.520
It's just a shame.

249
0:22:05.520 --> 0:22:06.520
Well, we could...

250
0:22:06.520 --> 0:22:09.520
Shall we interview someone in the room?

251
0:22:09.520 --> 0:22:10.520
Where is that listener?

252
0:22:10.520 --> 0:22:12.520
Where did he go?

253
0:22:12.520 --> 0:22:14.520
You want to...

254
0:22:14.520 --> 0:22:15.520
Okay, he doesn't.

255
0:22:15.520 --> 0:22:16.520
Okay, fair enough.

256
0:22:16.520 --> 0:22:17.520
He's too shy for that.

257
0:22:17.520 --> 0:22:18.520
Okay, fair enough.

258
0:22:18.520 --> 0:22:19.520
It's a shame.

259
0:22:19.520 --> 0:22:21.520
We should get him framed.

260
0:22:21.520 --> 0:22:22.520
Good chance.

261
0:22:22.520 --> 0:22:24.520
We're not listening.

262
0:22:24.520 --> 0:22:25.520
No.

263
0:22:25.520 --> 0:22:30.520
By the way, when did you start to listen to a Linux in-laws, if I may ask?

264
0:22:30.520 --> 0:22:31.520
I'm not sure.

265
0:22:31.520 --> 0:22:34.520
I have a couple of them back on, but my answer is no.

266
0:22:34.520 --> 0:22:35.520
We all know yours.

267
0:22:35.520 --> 0:22:38.520
That's how you can find your own source app.

268
0:22:38.520 --> 0:22:40.520
And then I'll be honest with you.

269
0:22:40.520 --> 0:22:42.520
Okay, did you get that?

270
0:22:42.520 --> 0:22:43.520
Something about feedback.

271
0:22:43.520 --> 0:22:47.520
Sorry, okay, let's talk later on this, sorry.

272
0:22:47.520 --> 0:22:50.520
Okay, no, we were just curious because...

273
0:22:50.520 --> 0:22:56.520
Yeah, we get feedback at times, but the more we get, the better, obviously.

274
0:22:56.520 --> 0:23:02.520
Exactly, because essentially we do the podcast for you in terms of, okay, this is our show,

275
0:23:02.520 --> 0:23:07.520
but we live on feedback because if you think, and that goes for anybody listening to us,

276
0:23:07.520 --> 0:23:12.520
if there's a subject that is of interest for you, feel free to give feedback so we can

277
0:23:12.520 --> 0:23:17.520
get that project on the show, talk to these politicians, whatever.

278
0:23:17.520 --> 0:23:21.520
And we're not kind of fixed on one particular topic, right?

279
0:23:21.520 --> 0:23:27.520
If you take the Rand Levy example with Minish's Life, they're very much focused on security.

280
0:23:27.520 --> 0:23:28.520
Very true, yes.

281
0:23:28.520 --> 0:23:32.520
We'll do an episode on security, but we won't do a whole podcast on that.

282
0:23:32.520 --> 0:23:35.520
We'll do anything around open source.

283
0:23:35.520 --> 0:23:38.520
Exactly, needless to say, an open source angle would help.

284
0:23:38.520 --> 0:23:39.520
Yes, that would help.

285
0:23:39.520 --> 0:23:46.520
But at the end of the day, the Electronic Fronto Foundation is more like about civil rights.

286
0:23:46.520 --> 0:23:53.520
And when we did the episode with the Jordan chapter, I think one of the focus points of

287
0:23:53.520 --> 0:23:56.520
that interview was actually gun laws.

288
0:23:56.520 --> 0:23:57.520
Yes.

289
0:23:57.520 --> 0:24:03.520
For example, so the point that I'm making here is, yes, open source is important for us,

290
0:24:03.520 --> 0:24:11.520
but so are the politics and the civil rights aspects behind this whole notion, behind this

291
0:24:11.520 --> 0:24:12.520
whole revolution.

292
0:24:12.520 --> 0:24:17.520
Well, this is the part about free, isn't it, really, that we have in free and open source

293
0:24:17.520 --> 0:24:20.520
software that we also have talked about.

294
0:24:20.520 --> 0:24:21.520
Absolutely.

295
0:24:21.520 --> 0:24:26.520
And that's exactly the reason why we try to maintain the balance between technical and

296
0:24:26.520 --> 0:24:27.520
non-technical subjects.

297
0:24:27.520 --> 0:24:28.520
Ah, yes.

298
0:24:28.520 --> 0:24:32.520
And also, if you do have trouble sleeping, there is an episode on licenses, if I'm not

299
0:24:32.520 --> 0:24:33.520
mistaken.

300
0:24:33.520 --> 0:24:34.520
Yes, on open source licensing.

301
0:24:34.520 --> 0:24:35.520
So, yes.

302
0:24:35.520 --> 0:24:39.520
But we didn't have guests on this, so.

303
0:24:39.520 --> 0:24:44.920
So, yes, it has many uses there.

304
0:24:44.920 --> 0:24:46.520
We should probably talk about the road ahead, right?

305
0:24:46.520 --> 0:24:47.520
Oh.

306
0:24:47.520 --> 0:24:51.520
I mean, we've been doing this for the last three years now.

307
0:24:51.520 --> 0:24:53.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

308
0:24:53.520 --> 0:24:55.520
Where do you want to take this, Martin?

309
0:24:55.520 --> 0:25:03.520
Apart from the usual world domination, making lots of money, how is it yet to be determined?

310
0:25:03.520 --> 0:25:10.000
No, the objective is already kind of met, right, we're spreading the word and supporting

311
0:25:10.000 --> 0:25:15.520
the projects and the people that make open source, so we continue doing that, in my opinion.

312
0:25:15.520 --> 0:25:16.520
True, true, true.

313
0:25:16.520 --> 0:25:18.280
But maybe there's something more.

314
0:25:18.280 --> 0:25:19.280
Is there?

315
0:25:19.280 --> 0:25:20.280
Probably.

316
0:25:20.280 --> 0:25:21.280
Do tell.

317
0:25:21.280 --> 0:25:25.360
Well, some people have suggested, when we still have the focus groups, that more humor

318
0:25:25.360 --> 0:25:28.520
might be in order, for example, as in more dark side stuff.

319
0:25:28.520 --> 0:25:32.520
Okay, well, we'll have to get some feedback on that, won't we?

320
0:25:32.520 --> 0:25:33.520
Indeed.

321
0:25:33.520 --> 0:25:34.520
Okay.

322
0:25:34.520 --> 0:25:35.520
Yes?

323
0:25:35.520 --> 0:25:36.520
What happened?

324
0:25:36.520 --> 0:25:42.520
And it doesn't say if our listeners have more ideas, the more the merrier.

325
0:25:42.520 --> 0:25:43.520
Indeed.

326
0:25:43.520 --> 0:25:46.400
Well, we have a, I mean, the whole year is planned out pretty much, but there's always

327
0:25:46.400 --> 0:25:47.800
room for...

328
0:25:47.800 --> 0:25:48.800
Of course, yes.

329
0:25:48.800 --> 0:25:32.520
...

330
0:25:48.800 --> 0:25:49.560
...

331
0:25:49.560 --> 0:25:49.560
...

332
0:25:49.560 --> 0:25:49.560
...

333
0:25:49.560 --> 0:25:49.560
...

334
0:25:49.560 --> 0:25:50.060
...

335
0:25:50.060 --> 0:25:50.560
...

336
0:25:50.560 --> 0:25:51.060
...

337
0:25:51.060 --> 0:25:51.560
...

338
0:25:51.560 --> 0:25:52.060
...

339
0:25:52.060 --> 0:25:52.560
...

340
0:25:52.560 --> 0:25:53.060
...

341
0:25:53.060 --> 0:25:53.560
...

342
0:25:53.560 --> 0:25:54.060
...

343
0:25:54.060 --> 0:25:54.560
...

344
0:25:54.560 --> 0:25:55.060
...

345
0:25:55.060 --> 0:25:55.560
...

346
0:25:55.560 --> 0:25:56.060
...

347
0:25:56.060 --> 0:25:56.560
...

348
0:25:56.560 --> 0:25:57.060
...

349
0:25:57.060 --> 0:25:57.560
...

350
0:25:57.560 --> 0:25:58.060
...

351
0:25:58.060 --> 0:25:59.060
...

352
0:25:59.060 --> 0:26:00.060
...

353
0:26:00.060 --> 0:26:01.060
...

354
0:26:01.060 --> 0:26:02.060
...

355
0:26:02.060 --> 0:26:02.580
...

356
0:26:02.580 --> 0:26:05.940
after this talk goes without saying.

357
0:26:05.940 --> 0:26:08.900
Yes, this is exactly the point, right?

358
0:26:08.900 --> 0:26:12.580
If you have things that you want to be vocal about

359
0:26:12.580 --> 0:26:14.100
or talk about, open source related,

360
0:26:14.100 --> 0:26:16.820
whether it's a project or your community efforts,

361
0:26:16.820 --> 0:26:19.400
come talk to us and we'll put you on the podcast.

362
0:26:20.360 --> 0:26:24.340
And with that, it's probably time for our interview guests.

363
0:26:24.340 --> 0:26:26.460
Oh, interview guests, yes.

364
0:26:26.460 --> 0:26:28.140
We do have an interview guest.

365
0:26:28.140 --> 0:26:29.780
Right, welcome, welcome, interview guests.

366
0:26:29.780 --> 0:26:33.060
Matthias, why don't you join us on the stage?

367
0:26:33.060 --> 0:26:34.260
It's a little bit ahead of time,

368
0:26:34.260 --> 0:26:35.860
but more than Maria anyway.

369
0:26:35.860 --> 0:26:39.660
You get a bit of a feel for how we do the episode.

370
0:26:39.660 --> 0:26:43.580
For those of you who do not know Matthias Kirchner,

371
0:26:43.580 --> 0:26:45.380
why don't you introduce yourself?

372
0:26:46.700 --> 0:26:48.460
Yes, my name is Matthias Kirchner.

373
0:26:48.460 --> 0:26:51.280
I'm the president of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

374
0:26:51.280 --> 0:26:52.700
That's my day job.

375
0:26:52.700 --> 0:26:57.540
And yeah, beside that, I did some volunteer activities,

376
0:26:57.540 --> 0:27:00.420
which is probably the topic of this interview.

377
0:27:01.540 --> 0:27:05.140
Absolutely, so hands up,

378
0:27:05.140 --> 0:27:08.140
who does not know what the Free Software Foundation Europe

379
0:27:08.140 --> 0:27:09.200
does and is?

380
0:27:10.500 --> 0:27:11.740
So everybody knows the FSFE.

381
0:27:11.740 --> 0:27:13.420
You can skip that question.

382
0:27:13.420 --> 0:27:16.420
Fair enough, that was just getting that, okay.

383
0:27:16.420 --> 0:27:19.660
Of course, needless to say, there's also an episode

384
0:27:19.660 --> 0:27:22.940
from something called Linus in Laws on the FSFE.

385
0:27:22.940 --> 0:27:24.940
But yes, why don't you tell us a little bit about

386
0:27:24.940 --> 0:27:29.500
how you came into the open source world.

387
0:27:29.500 --> 0:27:31.020
Put you on the spot right now.

388
0:27:32.140 --> 0:27:37.140
Oh, I first, the start was that I asked my father

389
0:27:38.000 --> 0:27:40.540
to subscribe to more newspapers,

390
0:27:40.540 --> 0:27:43.180
so I can inform myself from more sources

391
0:27:44.420 --> 0:27:48.580
to see who is trying to accomplish world domination.

392
0:27:48.580 --> 0:27:50.640
And my father said, oh, that's too expensive,

393
0:27:50.640 --> 0:27:53.020
but I read something about this internet

394
0:27:53.020 --> 0:27:56.980
and I will make sure that you get this,

395
0:27:56.980 --> 0:27:59.460
which was at that time probably more expensive

396
0:27:59.460 --> 0:28:01.920
in the long run with the modem there.

397
0:28:01.920 --> 0:28:03.520
But yeah, I started with that

398
0:28:03.520 --> 0:28:05.420
and then I had a second computer at home

399
0:28:05.420 --> 0:28:07.460
and I tried to connect them

400
0:28:07.460 --> 0:28:09.220
and I wanted to send emails to them

401
0:28:09.220 --> 0:28:11.860
without connecting to the internet and it didn't work.

402
0:28:11.860 --> 0:28:15.860
Also, both of those computers had an email program on them.

403
0:28:15.860 --> 0:28:17.540
I complained at school.

404
0:28:17.540 --> 0:28:19.340
Someone said, I have something for you,

405
0:28:19.340 --> 0:28:21.540
brought some floppies, brought some CDs,

406
0:28:21.540 --> 0:28:24.980
and then I installed my first GNU Linux distribution.

407
0:28:25.820 --> 0:28:28.760
And a few months later, I had a mail server.

408
0:28:30.020 --> 0:28:34.180
And from there on, then I read more about technology.

409
0:28:34.180 --> 0:28:38.620
I organized the meetups to install parties

410
0:28:38.620 --> 0:28:42.700
for in the local groups, went to events,

411
0:28:42.700 --> 0:28:45.660
and then I read more and more about

412
0:28:45.660 --> 0:28:49.420
that it's also about political, social beliefs,

413
0:28:49.420 --> 0:28:54.020
and that's how I get interested in FSFE.

414
0:28:54.020 --> 0:28:56.220
Yeah, so I understand the technical background,

415
0:28:56.220 --> 0:28:58.900
but there's clearly more to it for yourself, right,

416
0:28:58.900 --> 0:29:01.500
than just the tech side with open source.

417
0:29:01.500 --> 0:29:06.500
I mean, at that time, I wasn't able to formulate it this way,

418
0:29:07.820 --> 0:29:09.260
but in the end, for me,

419
0:29:09.260 --> 0:29:14.020
Free Software is a way to distribute power in our society.

420
0:29:14.020 --> 0:29:17.420
I think democracies depend on distributing power

421
0:29:17.420 --> 0:29:21.260
and we also need a distribution of technological power

422
0:29:21.260 --> 0:29:23.380
and Free Software is an important tool for that

423
0:29:23.380 --> 0:29:26.060
to make sure that there is not one entity

424
0:29:26.060 --> 0:29:28.620
has too much power in our society.

425
0:29:28.620 --> 0:29:30.260
And I think that's the main part

426
0:29:30.260 --> 0:29:32.220
which is driving me for the work there.

427
0:29:33.100 --> 0:29:33.940
Very good, very good.

428
0:29:33.940 --> 0:29:35.780
Did you want to take the next one?

429
0:29:35.780 --> 0:29:38.820
And why did you decide to join eventually

430
0:29:38.820 --> 0:29:40.620
the Free Software Foundation Europe?

431
0:29:42.620 --> 0:29:46.220
So at that time, then, I mean, there was in this point,

432
0:29:46.220 --> 0:29:47.540
I had this political interest,

433
0:29:47.540 --> 0:29:49.020
I had this technical interest,

434
0:29:49.020 --> 0:29:51.100
I thought there are so many people on the internet

435
0:29:51.100 --> 0:29:53.420
when you have questions about technical issues,

436
0:29:53.420 --> 0:29:55.380
you can ask and there are so many bright people

437
0:29:55.380 --> 0:29:57.460
who will help you to figure it out,

438
0:29:57.460 --> 0:29:58.980
but about the political stuff,

439
0:29:58.980 --> 0:30:00.900
I was not able to figure that out myself,

440
0:30:00.900 --> 0:30:04.500
so I studied politics and management then

441
0:30:04.500 --> 0:30:07.220
and we had to do a seven months internship

442
0:30:07.220 --> 0:30:10.420
and I asked some people, some DBN developers I knew,

443
0:30:10.420 --> 0:30:11.980
where could I do that?

444
0:30:11.980 --> 0:30:15.020
And one of the suggestions was the FSFE

445
0:30:15.020 --> 0:30:17.700
and then I read about them and applied there

446
0:30:17.700 --> 0:30:20.500
and after longer back and forth,

447
0:30:20.500 --> 0:30:22.260
because they didn't have interns before

448
0:30:22.260 --> 0:30:24.060
and didn't have an office at that time

449
0:30:24.060 --> 0:30:27.140
and didn't have money to pay,

450
0:30:27.140 --> 0:30:30.660
in the end, I ended up there in the one room apartment

451
0:30:30.660 --> 0:30:34.740
of the president at that time on the sofa, he had a desk,

452
0:30:34.740 --> 0:30:37.060
and from there, I then worked and attended

453
0:30:37.060 --> 0:30:39.220
free software events, including my first Fostom

454
0:30:39.220 --> 0:30:40.700
then in 2005.

455
0:30:41.660 --> 0:30:42.660
Very nice, very nice.

456
0:30:42.660 --> 0:30:46.660
So there's clearly, yeah, what's next after that?

457
0:30:46.660 --> 0:30:49.540
Is there some other world domination plan for yourself?

458
0:30:51.900 --> 0:30:56.900
I think that the one that is running is just the topic,

459
0:30:57.700 --> 0:30:59.780
I don't know what you want to say already

460
0:30:59.780 --> 0:31:02.860
about your next episode.

461
0:31:02.860 --> 0:31:03.700
Tease it away.

462
0:31:04.740 --> 0:31:06.020
I mean, tease it away.

463
0:31:07.300 --> 0:31:11.060
Now is probably a good time to feature

464
0:31:11.060 --> 0:31:14.260
an upcoming presentation today or reading rather.

465
0:31:15.340 --> 0:31:19.180
Yeah, so I will do a reading of this new book,

466
0:31:19.180 --> 0:31:21.940
which I wrote, it's called Ada and Sangaman,

467
0:31:21.940 --> 0:31:25.420
A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice Cream.

468
0:31:25.420 --> 0:31:30.260
It's about encouraging people to tinker with computers,

469
0:31:30.260 --> 0:31:33.340
it's about software freedom in a way that is hopefully

470
0:31:33.340 --> 0:31:36.420
encouraging them to think on their own

471
0:31:36.420 --> 0:31:38.500
how they want to use technology.

472
0:31:38.500 --> 0:31:41.820
It will be at six o'clock now, I have to check the room

473
0:31:41.820 --> 0:31:45.900
again in UB2147.

474
0:31:45.900 --> 0:31:49.780
And there I will do a reading of the book in 30 minutes

475
0:31:49.780 --> 0:31:54.260
and afterwards answer some questions about how to write

476
0:31:54.260 --> 0:31:58.380
a book with under a free license, get that published

477
0:31:58.380 --> 0:32:02.100
by O'Reilly for the German version and no starch press

478
0:32:02.100 --> 0:32:07.100
for the English version plus other language versions.

479
0:32:07.100 --> 0:32:09.140
Clearly you have an objective with the book,

480
0:32:09.140 --> 0:32:11.780
it's not just, oh, let's write a book for a bit of fun,

481
0:32:11.780 --> 0:32:15.260
but there is more to it than that if I'm not mistaken.

482
0:32:16.380 --> 0:32:21.380
I mean, at the beginning, my main idea was how can I explain

483
0:32:22.580 --> 0:32:24.900
this topic to my own children?

484
0:32:24.900 --> 0:32:28.460
And I asked if others have some ideas about that

485
0:32:28.460 --> 0:32:30.820
and if there are some existing books and they were either

486
0:32:30.820 --> 0:32:35.820
for older children or they were about a bit complicated.

487
0:32:37.460 --> 0:32:41.220
And then I started to tell some bad time stories myself,

488
0:32:41.220 --> 0:32:45.140
always a bit improvised and then depending on the feedback,

489
0:32:45.140 --> 0:32:50.140
I was then just changing the stories at that time

490
0:32:50.700 --> 0:32:53.660
and then in the end, this came out of it.

491
0:32:55.340 --> 0:32:58.940
Is this your personal kind of initiative

492
0:32:58.940 --> 0:33:01.540
or is this something that the FSF is trying to promote

493
0:33:01.540 --> 0:33:05.540
in terms of making awareness amongst younger people?

494
0:33:05.540 --> 0:33:08.860
At the beginning, it was a personal project of mine

495
0:33:08.860 --> 0:33:12.580
and I was also writing this on my own time.

496
0:33:12.580 --> 0:33:16.420
Then at one point, I talked to someone and told him

497
0:33:16.420 --> 0:33:19.420
about this plan and he said, well, if you will write a book

498
0:33:19.420 --> 0:33:24.420
about free software, then I will buy 1000 copies

499
0:33:24.620 --> 0:33:26.980
and give that to customers.

500
0:33:26.980 --> 0:33:31.980
And then I talked with the FSFE and then I got the

501
0:33:33.860 --> 0:33:37.100
confirmation that I can spend a few hundred euros

502
0:33:37.100 --> 0:33:41.300
to get an editor on board so that I can get someone

503
0:33:41.300 --> 0:33:44.860
with experience how to actually write a children's book.

504
0:33:44.860 --> 0:33:48.020
And yeah, when we had this, then we could also hire

505
0:33:48.020 --> 0:33:51.980
an illustrator to do the illustrations for the book,

506
0:33:51.980 --> 0:33:55.060
and get an illustrator to understand Creative Commons

507
0:33:55.060 --> 0:33:57.300
licensing, which is very unusual for this area.

508
0:33:57.300 --> 0:34:02.300
And then we were also quite lucky to get two publishers

509
0:34:03.700 --> 0:34:08.700
on board who also understand free licensing

510
0:34:08.740 --> 0:34:11.740
and agreed to publish this as commercial publishers

511
0:34:11.740 --> 0:34:14.460
under CC by share like.

512
0:34:14.460 --> 0:34:15.300
Excellent, excellent.

513
0:34:15.300 --> 0:34:17.140
So where can people find the book?

514
0:34:19.140 --> 0:34:20.860
So the German one, it's-

515
0:34:20.860 --> 0:34:22.500
Oh, and you brought some with you today.

516
0:34:22.500 --> 0:34:27.500
So this is the commercial part or-

517
0:34:31.300 --> 0:34:35.140
At the German version, you can already buy that everywhere.

518
0:34:35.140 --> 0:34:38.580
The US version, the English version, you can at the moment

519
0:34:38.580 --> 0:34:41.660
just get that from the US publisher because the worldwide

520
0:34:41.660 --> 0:34:43.940
distribution just starts in May.

521
0:34:43.940 --> 0:34:48.940
So the FSFE, we got some of the books and brought them

522
0:34:49.300 --> 0:34:52.260
through customs, which was a pain.

523
0:34:52.260 --> 0:34:54.300
And we have them at the booth.

524
0:34:54.300 --> 0:34:57.580
And so we have a few amount of those here.

525
0:34:57.580 --> 0:35:01.460
And yeah, else from now on already, you can order that

526
0:35:01.460 --> 0:35:06.220
at every bookstore and pre-order will be shipped in May.

527
0:35:06.220 --> 0:35:09.660
And tonight you're doing the first, let's say,

528
0:35:09.660 --> 0:35:11.420
reading of the English version, right?

529
0:35:11.420 --> 0:35:14.620
Yeah, that was one of my wishes that Fosten will be the place

530
0:35:14.620 --> 0:35:17.180
where I do the first reading of the English book.

531
0:35:17.180 --> 0:35:19.260
And yeah, I will do that there.

532
0:35:19.260 --> 0:35:22.500
And for everyone else who would like to do that,

533
0:35:22.500 --> 0:35:24.740
I mean, you can first try it out.

534
0:35:24.740 --> 0:35:29.100
And one of my recommendations is it's a really great tool

535
0:35:29.100 --> 0:35:32.540
to talk to children about our topics.

536
0:35:32.540 --> 0:35:35.420
I did several readings with the German version at schools

537
0:35:35.420 --> 0:35:39.660
with 30 people, 40 children, or even once in a cinema

538
0:35:39.660 --> 0:35:44.260
with 150 children, talking with them about that,

539
0:35:44.260 --> 0:35:46.700
answering their questions they have, or having some

540
0:35:46.700 --> 0:35:50.140
discussions about what they want to invent, how computers work,

541
0:35:50.140 --> 0:35:50.740
and so on.

542
0:35:50.740 --> 0:35:53.300
And so we have all the slides and the text

543
0:35:53.300 --> 0:35:57.420
and where to change slides and all kind of other information,

544
0:35:57.420 --> 0:36:00.260
how you can do that on our Git repository.

545
0:36:00.260 --> 0:36:01.460
It's all freely licensed.

546
0:36:01.460 --> 0:36:03.820
You can make changes to it.

547
0:36:03.820 --> 0:36:05.900
Let's see what's coming out.

548
0:36:05.900 --> 0:36:09.140
You can make pre-ess equals.

549
0:36:09.140 --> 0:36:11.540
Yeah, I think that's something we will also

550
0:36:11.540 --> 0:36:17.340
discuss in the show, probably a tool for world domination.

551
0:36:17.340 --> 0:36:21.060
And for those of you who cannot make it at 6 PM,

552
0:36:21.060 --> 0:36:22.780
there will be a reading on something

553
0:36:22.780 --> 0:36:24.900
called Linux in Laws in an upcoming episode,

554
0:36:24.900 --> 0:36:26.540
more than likely in April.

555
0:36:26.540 --> 0:36:28.380
So if you missed this reading tonight,

556
0:36:28.380 --> 0:36:32.740
feel free to tune in or download that particular episode.

557
0:36:38.020 --> 0:36:40.100
Anything else we should discuss with the president

558
0:36:40.100 --> 0:36:42.740
while we have him on the stage, Martin?

559
0:36:42.740 --> 0:36:44.540
I think we should have some minutes left.

560
0:36:44.540 --> 0:36:46.980
Something else.

561
0:36:46.980 --> 0:36:49.740
No, I think we have some minutes left.

562
0:36:49.740 --> 0:36:52.820
So I think the subject has been beaten to death.

563
0:36:52.820 --> 0:36:56.140
But anyway, I would like still to have your opinion on this.

564
0:36:56.140 --> 0:37:02.060
Richardson Salomon, just to say this is on this,

565
0:37:02.060 --> 0:37:04.820
just to wake up the audience once again.

566
0:37:04.820 --> 0:37:07.860
I mean, it's history, fair enough.

567
0:37:07.860 --> 0:37:09.140
But it's been a while.

568
0:37:09.140 --> 0:37:11.980
But I think he has made a rebound in terms

569
0:37:11.980 --> 0:37:14.340
of he's back on the board now, right, of the Free Software

570
0:37:14.340 --> 0:37:14.860
Fund.

571
0:37:14.860 --> 0:37:18.940
I know that the FSFE issues a statement

572
0:37:18.940 --> 0:37:20.420
after the whole debacle.

573
0:37:20.420 --> 0:37:24.060
But I reckon he's back on track now, at least in the US.

574
0:37:24.060 --> 0:37:24.540
No?

575
0:37:24.540 --> 0:37:28.820
I mean, any views on this that you would like to share?

576
0:37:28.820 --> 0:37:31.380
Oh, that's very complicated.

577
0:37:31.380 --> 0:37:32.100
OK.

578
0:37:32.100 --> 0:37:37.220
And we still have, I think, 10 minutes left.

579
0:37:37.220 --> 0:37:39.340
The abridged version.

580
0:37:39.340 --> 0:37:41.580
Yeah.

581
0:37:41.580 --> 0:37:45.300
Now I was cornered here on this topic.

582
0:37:45.300 --> 0:37:48.620
Now I think that's a really complicated discussion.

583
0:37:48.620 --> 0:37:51.940
And it's also a discussion which, at the moment,

584
0:37:51.940 --> 0:37:55.980
I also prefer to have some personal conversations

585
0:37:55.980 --> 0:38:01.380
with other people involved in this before this is going

586
0:38:01.380 --> 0:38:01.860
public.

587
0:38:01.860 --> 0:38:07.060
So I'm sorry, but this is a bit too difficult to discuss.

588
0:38:07.060 --> 0:38:08.820
Very diplomatic answer.

589
0:38:08.820 --> 0:38:10.380
Back to much more safer grounds.

590
0:38:10.380 --> 0:38:12.700
Where do you see the Free Software Foundation Europe

591
0:38:12.700 --> 0:38:13.180
going?

592
0:38:16.020 --> 0:38:21.140
I mean, what I see is that the topics are going more

593
0:38:21.140 --> 0:38:22.540
and more mainstream.

594
0:38:22.540 --> 0:38:28.420
And so one of the big challenges there

595
0:38:28.420 --> 0:38:33.100
is how can we make sure that this topic doesn't stay

596
0:38:33.100 --> 0:38:37.100
at Fostem and at some Free Software conferences,

597
0:38:37.100 --> 0:38:40.180
but that we are going to other conferences

598
0:38:40.180 --> 0:38:43.380
and connect with other topics which are ongoing

599
0:38:43.380 --> 0:38:48.180
and which are very much influenced by our topics

600
0:38:48.180 --> 0:38:49.900
that we are usually discussing here.

601
0:38:49.900 --> 0:38:53.020
So when we talk about there are discussions

602
0:38:53.020 --> 0:38:56.980
in the sustainability area, which

603
0:38:56.980 --> 0:39:00.700
there's a huge dependency on can you really make changes

604
0:39:00.700 --> 0:39:02.860
to hardware or software.

605
0:39:02.860 --> 0:39:06.220
And how is technology developed there?

606
0:39:06.220 --> 0:39:12.180
There are questions about who should have control

607
0:39:12.180 --> 0:39:14.140
over the computers.

608
0:39:14.140 --> 0:39:16.660
I mean, we have net neutrality.

609
0:39:16.660 --> 0:39:18.740
On the other hand, it's very important

610
0:39:18.740 --> 0:39:20.220
that we also have device neutrality

611
0:39:20.220 --> 0:39:21.980
so that every one of us has the right

612
0:39:21.980 --> 0:39:24.940
to install or remove software on our devices

613
0:39:24.940 --> 0:39:28.940
that we can change web browsers, that we can change app stores,

614
0:39:28.940 --> 0:39:31.060
that we can change the services which

615
0:39:31.060 --> 0:39:33.460
are connected to our devices.

616
0:39:33.460 --> 0:39:36.020
And that's something which is, I mean,

617
0:39:36.020 --> 0:39:40.860
at the time when the movement started, it was small.

618
0:39:40.860 --> 0:39:43.620
And we had some desktop machines and some laptops.

619
0:39:43.620 --> 0:39:45.300
And now we have the computers everywhere.

620
0:39:45.300 --> 0:39:47.460
And now, I mean, there are so many people who

621
0:39:47.460 --> 0:39:49.220
have questions about this topic.

622
0:39:49.220 --> 0:39:52.820
So it's more and more important to translate this

623
0:39:52.820 --> 0:39:55.620
to a more general audience, people

624
0:39:55.620 --> 0:39:58.340
who don't have such knowledge about technology.

625
0:39:58.340 --> 0:40:04.660
And that's something which the FSFE always was doing this.

626
0:40:04.660 --> 0:40:08.780
But that's something where we have more and more demand

627
0:40:08.780 --> 0:40:09.460
about that.

628
0:40:09.460 --> 0:40:11.780
And it's now not anymore that you

629
0:40:11.780 --> 0:40:13.660
want to talk with people about free software.

630
0:40:13.660 --> 0:40:16.500
And most of them say, oh, I'm not interested.

631
0:40:16.500 --> 0:40:18.460
It's now more the problem that there

632
0:40:18.460 --> 0:40:21.140
are so many people who have questions about that.

633
0:40:21.140 --> 0:40:24.820
And we just have a limited amount of resources.

634
0:40:24.820 --> 0:40:29.060
So the important thing is, how can we enable more people,

635
0:40:29.060 --> 0:40:32.420
more volunteers, to also work on these topics?

636
0:40:32.420 --> 0:40:34.980
That's also why with this book, I mean,

637
0:40:34.980 --> 0:40:37.580
I'm invited to do a lot of readings at schools.

638
0:40:37.580 --> 0:40:41.620
But I will not be able to fulfill this, the demand there.

639
0:40:41.620 --> 0:40:45.500
So we need to enable others to also do that and do this.

640
0:40:45.500 --> 0:40:49.060
And that's also for all the other topics,

641
0:40:49.060 --> 0:40:55.140
with device neutrality, with sustainability, with public money,

642
0:40:55.140 --> 0:40:58.180
public code, one of the campaigns we are running,

643
0:40:58.180 --> 0:41:00.500
where there are so many governments which

644
0:41:00.500 --> 0:41:03.060
are interested and public administrations that

645
0:41:03.060 --> 0:41:03.820
are interested.

646
0:41:03.820 --> 0:41:07.100
Yes, I'm totally convinced, but how do I do that?

647
0:41:07.100 --> 0:41:11.260
And so that's one of the big challenges there.

648
0:41:11.260 --> 0:41:12.420
How do we enable that?

649
0:41:12.420 --> 0:41:15.140
And I mean, during the last three years,

650
0:41:15.140 --> 0:41:18.300
it was very difficult to motivate volunteers

651
0:41:18.300 --> 0:41:20.580
to get in contact with new volunteers.

652
0:41:20.580 --> 0:41:24.340
That's why something like Fostom now is very important there.

653
0:41:24.340 --> 0:41:26.460
I mean, fully story, the public money and public code

654
0:41:26.460 --> 0:41:29.260
was the first campaign where I came across the FSFE

655
0:41:29.260 --> 0:41:30.740
all those years back.

656
0:41:30.740 --> 0:41:33.380
At the moment, you're running a sustainability campaign

657
0:41:33.380 --> 0:41:36.460
in the era of mobile devices, if I recall correctly.

658
0:41:36.460 --> 0:41:38.340
That was, yeah, Upcycling Android,

659
0:41:38.340 --> 0:41:42.940
where we help people to install other ROMs, other operating

660
0:41:42.940 --> 0:41:46.460
systems on their mobile devices, and also explain people

661
0:41:46.460 --> 0:41:49.620
that it's important that you can install or remove software

662
0:41:49.620 --> 0:41:52.060
from devices and repair devices.

663
0:41:52.060 --> 0:41:53.980
So that's one other area.

664
0:41:53.980 --> 0:41:55.020
OK.

665
0:41:55.020 --> 0:41:59.620
And would you go as far as associating these campaigns

666
0:41:59.620 --> 0:42:02.260
with the right to repair that you almost

667
0:42:02.260 --> 0:42:04.180
touched upon a minute ago?

668
0:42:04.180 --> 0:42:05.340
Yeah, I mean, the right to repair

669
0:42:05.340 --> 0:42:10.300
is definitely one part of this whole device neutrality area.

670
0:42:10.300 --> 0:42:14.740
Any future campaigns that you want to tease now?

671
0:42:14.740 --> 0:42:17.980
I mean, there are several things that will come up.

672
0:42:17.980 --> 0:42:21.260
But one thing that, for me, is very important

673
0:42:21.260 --> 0:42:22.460
at this time of the year.

674
0:42:22.460 --> 0:42:24.020
So it's February.

675
0:42:24.020 --> 0:42:27.100
And on the 14th of February, we are always

676
0:42:27.100 --> 0:42:29.620
running the ILAF Free Software Day.

677
0:42:29.620 --> 0:42:31.460
The idea at that time was I thought

678
0:42:31.460 --> 0:42:34.580
that the flower industry is benefiting so much

679
0:42:34.580 --> 0:42:36.500
from this day.

680
0:42:36.500 --> 0:42:38.700
Why can't we have something where the free software

681
0:42:38.700 --> 0:42:40.620
community is benefiting from this?

682
0:42:40.620 --> 0:42:41.140
Indeed.

683
0:42:41.140 --> 0:42:43.060
Free software is kind of what we need.

684
0:42:43.060 --> 0:42:43.980
Yeah.

685
0:42:43.980 --> 0:42:48.180
And I think in our community, we give each other

686
0:42:48.180 --> 0:42:51.740
very open feedback, very direct feedback.

687
0:42:51.740 --> 0:42:55.340
But sometimes we forget to say thank you

688
0:42:55.340 --> 0:42:59.140
to all those amazing people here at the conference who

689
0:42:59.140 --> 0:43:01.620
help others with their knowledge, who share their software

690
0:43:01.620 --> 0:43:02.820
with others.

691
0:43:02.820 --> 0:43:05.580
And so at the 14th of February, we always

692
0:43:05.580 --> 0:43:08.860
encourage everyone out there to thank other free software

693
0:43:08.860 --> 0:43:11.100
contributors out there.

694
0:43:11.100 --> 0:43:12.220
Buy them a beverage.

695
0:43:12.220 --> 0:43:14.980
Send them a letter or a postcard.

696
0:43:14.980 --> 0:43:18.140
Or I mean, just in general, say thank you to them.

697
0:43:18.140 --> 0:43:21.060
Because it's something which, in the end, I mean,

698
0:43:21.060 --> 0:43:24.020
all of those people, they are doing such a great job,

699
0:43:24.020 --> 0:43:28.640
such an important contribution to our society, which

700
0:43:28.640 --> 0:43:29.860
we often forget about.

701
0:43:29.860 --> 0:43:33.100
And so do this on the 14th of February.

702
0:43:33.100 --> 0:43:34.460
Add it to your calendar.

703
0:43:34.460 --> 0:43:36.180
And the next day, you can continue

704
0:43:36.180 --> 0:43:38.220
to write feature requests, bug reports,

705
0:43:38.220 --> 0:43:40.540
complain why this programming language is used,

706
0:43:40.540 --> 0:43:45.220
and not the other, and why this approach is bad

707
0:43:45.220 --> 0:43:46.780
and yours is better.

708
0:43:46.780 --> 0:43:49.580
But yeah, don't forget to say thank you once a year,

709
0:43:49.580 --> 0:43:50.080
at least.

710
0:43:50.080 --> 0:43:52.740
Also, there are, at least in Germany,

711
0:43:52.740 --> 0:43:55.700
there are a couple of events taking place.

712
0:43:55.700 --> 0:43:59.300
For example, one of the Frankfurt user groups,

713
0:43:59.300 --> 0:44:02.220
I think it's even the CCC, as in the GAS Computer Club,

714
0:44:02.220 --> 0:44:07.940
has an event at the headquarters celebrating this free software

715
0:44:07.940 --> 0:44:08.440
day.

716
0:44:08.440 --> 0:44:11.140
So if you want to take part in this, check out.

717
0:44:11.140 --> 0:44:13.780
Is it on the website?

718
0:44:13.780 --> 0:44:16.900
So yeah, on the website, fsfv.org, in the news section,

719
0:44:16.900 --> 0:44:19.780
you find an entry there about I Love Free Software Day.

720
0:44:19.780 --> 0:44:23.900
And several local groups are also organizing events

721
0:44:23.900 --> 0:44:26.340
where we are inviting free software contributors.

722
0:44:26.340 --> 0:44:28.460
Make sure that there are some pizza, some cake,

723
0:44:28.460 --> 0:44:30.740
and there are people who can thank the others.

724
0:44:30.740 --> 0:44:34.960
We have, in Berlin also, at the C-BASE hacker space,

725
0:44:34.960 --> 0:44:36.380
we have a DJ there.

726
0:44:36.380 --> 0:44:38.220
We have an event in Crease.

727
0:44:38.220 --> 0:44:40.060
We have an event in Frankfurt.

728
0:44:40.060 --> 0:44:42.500
And there are others there.

729
0:44:42.500 --> 0:44:44.540
And if you want to organize that on your,

730
0:44:44.540 --> 0:44:46.620
something like that on your own, let us know.

731
0:44:46.620 --> 0:44:49.500
So we can also list your I Love Free Software Day event.

732
0:44:49.500 --> 0:44:53.860
It's an event where we hope that many of you here,

733
0:44:53.860 --> 0:44:56.060
many of the people visiting Fosten,

734
0:44:56.060 --> 0:44:58.500
will receive a thank you for your work.

735
0:44:58.500 --> 0:45:00.900
And well, if you want to organize something there,

736
0:45:00.900 --> 0:45:01.980
let us know.

737
0:45:01.980 --> 0:45:05.860
We can also help you a bit when you register there

738
0:45:05.860 --> 0:45:10.420
that we could cover the pizza for this event or so.

739
0:45:10.420 --> 0:45:12.020
Then just write us an email and we

740
0:45:12.020 --> 0:45:14.860
will see that we can also financially

741
0:45:14.860 --> 0:45:17.980
support when you want to organize that.

742
0:45:17.980 --> 0:45:21.900
Because we think that if every euro that

743
0:45:21.900 --> 0:45:26.380
is invested in such a nice event and some nice cake there,

744
0:45:26.380 --> 0:45:29.340
that this would benefit free software in the long run

745
0:45:29.340 --> 0:45:33.620
a lot because it's so motivating to receive

746
0:45:33.620 --> 0:45:35.180
some appreciation for your work.

747
0:45:35.180 --> 0:45:36.980
Sounds like a bit like the dark side.

748
0:45:36.980 --> 0:45:38.900
We have cookies, don't we?

749
0:45:38.900 --> 0:45:39.980
Cake in this case.

750
0:45:39.980 --> 0:45:43.220
So people, this has been almost a live session of something

751
0:45:43.220 --> 0:45:44.420
called Linux In-laws.

752
0:45:44.420 --> 0:45:47.980
This is the format that we normally do every month

753
0:45:47.980 --> 0:45:50.620
as in bringing guests on stage, putting him or her

754
0:45:50.620 --> 0:45:53.980
right on the spot, and then having a little bit of fun.

755
0:45:53.980 --> 0:45:59.980
If you like this, the feed address is on the screen.

756
0:45:59.980 --> 0:46:03.220
I think we have time for one more question

757
0:46:03.220 --> 0:46:06.620
from the audience.

758
0:46:06.620 --> 0:46:08.980
Is there any question that you would

759
0:46:08.980 --> 0:46:11.580
like to get answered right now, preferably

760
0:46:11.580 --> 0:46:17.660
from a free and open source software background?

761
0:46:17.660 --> 0:46:22.420
If there isn't, thank you very much for listening,

762
0:46:22.420 --> 0:46:24.580
I'm tempted to say.

763
0:46:24.580 --> 0:46:27.060
There will be a session tonight.

764
0:46:27.060 --> 0:46:29.300
As in, you can ask us anything.

765
0:46:29.300 --> 0:46:31.060
You also find the address on the website.

766
0:46:31.060 --> 0:46:33.020
It's just a little bit of fun.

767
0:46:33.020 --> 0:46:37.620
And at that pub, we're going to start at about 8.30.

768
0:46:37.620 --> 0:46:41.860
The place isn't too big, so just make sure

769
0:46:41.860 --> 0:46:45.700
that you are there on time in order to avoid disappointment

770
0:46:45.700 --> 0:46:46.900
if you can't get in.

771
0:46:46.900 --> 0:46:48.660
So 8.30 at that address.

772
0:46:48.660 --> 0:46:50.580
You also find this on Linux In-laws.

773
0:46:50.580 --> 0:46:52.580
You just click on the Forstam tab.

774
0:46:52.580 --> 0:46:54.020
Thank you very much.

775
0:46:54.020 --> 0:46:54.660
Thank you very much.

776
0:46:54.660 --> 0:46:55.180
Thank you.

777
0:46:55.180 --> 0:47:03.340
Thank you.
