1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.820
I'm going to talk today about when I wrote the talk, I said open source collaboration,

2
0:00:12.820 --> 0:00:17.960
but I think open collaboration more in general is maybe more appropriate.

3
0:00:17.960 --> 0:00:25.260
I think we have as developers, it doesn't allow me to touch code anymore, but you have

4
0:00:25.260 --> 0:00:31.320
an amazing potential to make the world a better place.

5
0:00:31.320 --> 0:00:39.920
Today I'd like to talk about first of all, why open source is eating the world.

6
0:00:39.920 --> 0:00:44.200
I want to start with a bit of my personal journey that hopefully makes you understand

7
0:00:44.200 --> 0:00:50.520
sort of the background that I'm coming from.

8
0:00:50.520 --> 0:00:58.960
I started about 15 years ago in open source and I had a lot more hair and I guess at the

9
0:00:58.960 --> 0:01:04.600
cost of aging myself, how many people know something called Apache Cocoon?

10
0:01:04.600 --> 0:01:06.000
Exactly.

11
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:08.320
I figured.

12
0:01:08.320 --> 0:01:11.200
Exactly.

13
0:01:11.200 --> 0:01:18.840
I started in open source really because it was fun, because it was, I gotta say, also

14
0:01:18.840 --> 0:01:21.840
a way for me to accelerate my career.

15
0:01:21.840 --> 0:01:27.080
The opportunity to collaborate on the left side, you got my best friend who still is

16
0:01:27.080 --> 0:01:28.080
my best friend.

17
0:01:28.080 --> 0:01:35.640
I made some of my best friendships in open source, but the day that I got my Apache email

18
0:01:35.640 --> 0:01:38.600
address, I still remember it.

19
0:01:38.600 --> 0:01:46.800
I was so proud about being in the, in between so many smart guys, effectively much smarter

20
0:01:46.800 --> 0:01:50.680
than me because I've been pretty much mainly a release manager at that time.

21
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:53.520
I never really wrote super hard code.

22
0:01:53.520 --> 0:02:01.920
That's where I started, really as a personal motivator.

23
0:02:01.920 --> 0:02:05.520
Then I moved into, I had the luck to move to Holland.

24
0:02:05.520 --> 0:02:14.520
Let's say in Italy, didn't really have such a lively technology ecosystem in 2006.

25
0:02:14.520 --> 0:02:20.680
Then I had the luck of starting to get paid to do my open source work, whether it was

26
0:02:20.680 --> 0:02:29.800
community open source, building SDKs, whether it is actually as part of my day job, being

27
0:02:29.800 --> 0:02:36.360
able to be first a developer, then a product manager for the developer platform.

28
0:02:36.360 --> 0:02:42.400
Not sure what I'm doing up there, but I guess clearly I was having a lot of fun in Munich

29
0:02:42.400 --> 0:02:46.640
or thereabouts.

30
0:02:46.640 --> 0:02:47.760
Then I moved to the US.

31
0:02:47.760 --> 0:02:53.760
I never really grew up with the American dream.

32
0:02:53.760 --> 0:03:01.360
I just say that, but both for work and for personal reasons, I moved to the United States

33
0:03:01.360 --> 0:03:08.480
and I entered this magic world of foundations.

34
0:03:08.480 --> 0:03:12.080
A foundation in a pretty conservative and regulated industry.

35
0:03:12.080 --> 0:03:16.720
This was 2015 when I got called to run, what at the time was called the Symphony Software

36
0:03:16.720 --> 0:03:22.720
Foundation and now it's Finos, the FinTech open source foundation.

37
0:03:22.720 --> 0:03:31.920
I tried to take the Apache way, my open source upbringing and throw it at banks.

38
0:03:31.920 --> 0:03:34.320
It didn't really stick.

39
0:03:34.320 --> 0:03:38.960
I started saying, hey, if it doesn't happen on the list, it doesn't happen.

40
0:03:38.960 --> 0:03:43.160
You guys should collaborate openly.

41
0:03:43.160 --> 0:03:44.160
It didn't work.

42
0:03:44.160 --> 0:03:51.560
I really had to switch gears and start talking to them about what was the value for them

43
0:03:51.560 --> 0:03:55.720
to collaborate in the open.

44
0:03:55.720 --> 0:04:02.400
Not undermining the principles and the transparency and the governance of open source, but I found

45
0:04:02.400 --> 0:04:08.720
much more success in bringing all different constituents together, whether it is financial

46
0:04:08.720 --> 0:04:15.200
institutions, whether it is technology vendors, whether it is individual contributors, of

47
0:04:15.200 --> 0:04:19.320
course, that make still the largest part of our community.

48
0:04:19.320 --> 0:04:22.760
I think very interesting regulators.

49
0:04:22.760 --> 0:04:28.040
I think a theme that you're going to hear quite recurring during the presentation.

50
0:04:28.040 --> 0:04:37.200
There is something there in having active public sector collaboration in industries,

51
0:04:37.200 --> 0:04:39.080
in open source projects.

52
0:04:39.080 --> 0:04:42.480
There's still a long way to go.

53
0:04:42.480 --> 0:04:47.520
I wouldn't say that banks are first class citizens of the open source community, but

54
0:04:47.520 --> 0:04:54.640
we were able to make some of the largest firms in the US and in Europe, and in the UK, I

55
0:04:54.640 --> 0:04:58.480
guess, extended Europe, collaborate.

56
0:04:58.480 --> 0:05:02.760
That's I think the beginning of something quite interesting because they have some pretty

57
0:05:02.760 --> 0:05:09.160
powerful technology that they're now making available and trying to be good citizens to

58
0:05:09.160 --> 0:05:14.880
maintain, not just dump and run.

59
0:05:14.880 --> 0:05:17.560
And then it got personal.

60
0:05:17.560 --> 0:05:20.680
Probably seen on my desktop the picture of my kid.

61
0:05:20.680 --> 0:05:29.600
Leonardo, his special needs kid, pretty heavily fragile as a kid.

62
0:05:29.600 --> 0:05:33.320
When I started seeing the... Yeah, he was born like a lion.

63
0:05:33.320 --> 0:05:37.440
No, this disability.

64
0:05:37.440 --> 0:05:44.320
I started seeing how open source, again, really this is close to my heart.

65
0:05:44.320 --> 0:05:49.440
There are plenty of efforts out there that are trying to use either open data or open

66
0:05:49.440 --> 0:05:56.360
source truly open collaboration approach to solve things that, for which there's no

67
0:05:56.360 --> 0:05:58.640
commercial liability.

68
0:05:58.640 --> 0:06:08.080
Big pharma is much more encouraged to work on cancer, vaccines, things that have a massive

69
0:06:08.080 --> 0:06:15.440
applicability and therefore massive commercial potential rather than solving very rare genetic

70
0:06:15.440 --> 0:06:24.040
diseases where you have 10 people in the world having that specific gene that is a mutation.

71
0:06:24.040 --> 0:06:31.520
And so open treatment is under the Linux condition, open single nucleotide polymorphism.

72
0:06:31.520 --> 0:06:40.520
I'm not really a biologist or doctor, but you see the power of bringing together data

73
0:06:40.520 --> 0:06:47.080
from all around the world to make something out of where there's no really commercial

74
0:06:47.080 --> 0:06:48.080
drive.

75
0:06:48.080 --> 0:06:52.320
There's no drive for innovation.

76
0:06:52.320 --> 0:07:01.880
And so all of this to say that I find open source itself to be the positive sum game

77
0:07:01.880 --> 0:07:10.440
for which whether you are corporate, whether you are a government, whether you are an individual,

78
0:07:10.440 --> 0:07:15.520
we can find ways to engage these people.

79
0:07:15.520 --> 0:07:23.680
And I know that there's a lot of polarization today and I hope, nowadays, whether it is

80
0:07:23.680 --> 0:07:30.440
individual versus big tech, whether it's Europe versus the US or China, but I do think without

81
0:07:30.440 --> 0:07:37.560
being naive that open source actually can be a way for everyone to collaborate and deliver

82
0:07:37.560 --> 0:07:41.840
not just technology innovation but social value.

83
0:07:41.840 --> 0:07:48.200
So I want to, before we go into sort of what are the challenges, I think it's important

84
0:07:48.200 --> 0:07:53.680
to talk and sort of understand how some of the most successful projects, at least in

85
0:07:53.680 --> 0:07:55.680
my experience, came about.

86
0:07:55.680 --> 0:08:03.080
I mean, I'm sure you're all pretty familiar with a guy called Linus Torbald, so I'm not

87
0:08:03.080 --> 0:08:09.240
going to go into Linux as a pretty obvious example of a project that was individually

88
0:08:09.240 --> 0:08:13.280
started or individually led at the beginning.

89
0:08:13.280 --> 0:08:19.120
But more recently, again, more in the world of finance, one example that has been pretty

90
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:26.160
interesting to me of a project that started by an individual out of really coding, maybe

91
0:08:26.160 --> 0:08:33.800
not certainly a garage, but during the pandemic in lockdown, it's a software called OpenBB.

92
0:08:33.800 --> 0:08:36.920
It used to be called Gainstunk terminal.

93
0:08:36.920 --> 0:08:46.080
If you're familiar with the GameStop frenzy two years ago where the community started

94
0:08:46.080 --> 0:08:54.760
betting against Wall Street and created a pretty interesting basically growth of a stock

95
0:08:54.760 --> 0:09:02.600
that really didn't GameStop, didn't really have a lot more value, but it was an example

96
0:09:02.600 --> 0:09:15.640
of a movement that was really trying to democratize access to a very elitist and very wealthy

97
0:09:15.640 --> 0:09:16.640
part of the industry.

98
0:09:16.640 --> 0:09:25.080
And so one guy overnight built sort of a replacement Bloomberg terminal.

99
0:09:25.080 --> 0:09:29.080
For those of you who are not familiar with Bloomberg terminals, what people use in Wall

100
0:09:29.080 --> 0:09:39.520
Street is a very closed, very heavily proprietary terminal, literally a thing, a box that are

101
0:09:39.520 --> 0:09:43.200
used by traders to research and trade.

102
0:09:43.200 --> 0:09:47.720
And so someone went out there and built an actual terminal.

103
0:09:47.720 --> 0:09:55.280
Turns out that normally when you pair open source with a cause, you really get a potential

104
0:09:55.280 --> 0:09:59.280
amazing exponential growth, but of course timing has to be right.

105
0:09:59.280 --> 0:10:05.760
This was done when at the very moment that the whole world of retail investors was betting

106
0:10:05.760 --> 0:10:06.760
against Wall Street.

107
0:10:06.760 --> 0:10:10.640
And of course it's not just about the code.

108
0:10:10.640 --> 0:10:18.120
It was lucky DDA, which I happen to be a friend of, was able to put it on Acorn News.

109
0:10:18.120 --> 0:10:22.160
It went viral on Acorn News, went number one.

110
0:10:22.160 --> 0:10:23.520
And so it was off the races.

111
0:10:23.520 --> 0:10:29.120
It started getting contributions, it's now gotten funding, and it rebranded from, again,

112
0:10:29.120 --> 0:10:32.080
gainstump terminal to OpenBB.

113
0:10:32.080 --> 0:10:37.240
So there's a lot of power when you are able to pair open source with an actual social

114
0:10:37.240 --> 0:10:44.480
cause or an individual cause.

115
0:10:44.480 --> 0:10:50.160
Now we're very familiar, I think, with corporate led open source projects.

116
0:10:50.160 --> 0:10:53.640
We're getting more and more common.

117
0:10:53.640 --> 0:10:57.320
There are two examples here.

118
0:10:57.320 --> 0:11:05.360
As I said, I never really grew up with the American dream, but it has to be said that

119
0:11:05.360 --> 0:11:15.880
some contributions from big tech like Kubernetes or PyTorch have certainly created opportunities

120
0:11:15.880 --> 0:11:16.880
out there.

121
0:11:16.880 --> 0:11:22.720
And of course this is not because of charity, let's be clear.

122
0:11:22.720 --> 0:11:30.120
While us coming from the open source community have an aspect of conscience, these large

123
0:11:30.120 --> 0:11:36.520
corporations largely do open source because they see a potential down the line, whether

124
0:11:36.520 --> 0:11:39.000
it is commoditizing a competitor.

125
0:11:39.000 --> 0:11:45.920
If you've never seen the Kubernetes documentary, they actually have a documentary.

126
0:11:45.920 --> 0:11:50.560
Which one day I'll be so cool that I have a documentary about my project.

127
0:11:50.560 --> 0:11:54.840
But Google said it out loud.

128
0:11:54.840 --> 0:12:01.000
Incrementalism step by step wasn't going to get them to catch up with Amazon on the

129
0:12:01.000 --> 0:12:02.720
cloud front.

130
0:12:02.720 --> 0:12:06.000
And so the open source Kubernetes.

131
0:12:06.000 --> 0:12:15.880
We now have about 21 trillion investment globally, about 1 trillion in Europe.

132
0:12:15.880 --> 0:12:21.080
And Kubernetes is one of the most sought after skills out there.

133
0:12:21.080 --> 0:12:27.680
And again, this doesn't mean that the motives originally were about the spirit of open source,

134
0:12:27.680 --> 0:12:30.920
but certainly it has created opportunity.

135
0:12:30.920 --> 0:12:32.720
Same for PyTorch.

136
0:12:32.720 --> 0:12:40.240
Some of the main advancements out there, we can talk about TensorFlow, but really AI

137
0:12:40.240 --> 0:12:49.080
has certainly benefited from the open sourcing and more recently the introduction of open

138
0:12:49.080 --> 0:12:53.480
governance around some of these projects.

139
0:12:53.480 --> 0:12:57.480
But of course, as I said, open governance, you must play by the rules.

140
0:12:57.480 --> 0:13:03.080
And I know that we all have slightly different ideas what the rules should be, but certainly

141
0:13:03.080 --> 0:13:08.000
a good starting point is to use an OSI approved license.

142
0:13:08.000 --> 0:13:14.800
And ideally, be in any foundation where you can bring all the different parties together

143
0:13:14.800 --> 0:13:20.000
and be a neutral environment.

144
0:13:20.000 --> 0:13:29.360
And then we have plenty of examples of non-profit led open source, whether it is projects from

145
0:13:29.360 --> 0:13:37.040
the Linux Foundation or more from a 501c3-type charity like, for example, Mojalup, the works

146
0:13:37.040 --> 0:13:40.400
around financial inclusion.

147
0:13:40.400 --> 0:13:48.000
We have seen, especially in the last few years, how open source not always super successfully.

148
0:13:48.000 --> 0:13:55.840
Because, for example, I left Public Health was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

149
0:13:55.840 --> 0:14:00.840
to have open source COVID tracking apps.

150
0:14:00.840 --> 0:14:04.040
And it's been used in some governments.

151
0:14:04.040 --> 0:14:11.560
But as a US resident, I still have my paper vaccine card like when I was in the 80s.

152
0:14:11.560 --> 0:14:15.920
So it hasn't really been as ubiquitous as we wanted to be.

153
0:14:15.920 --> 0:14:24.120
But certainly the attempt was correct, that we are all in a major global crisis and open

154
0:14:24.120 --> 0:14:27.120
source can help.

155
0:14:27.120 --> 0:14:32.880
A great example is OpenSSF.

156
0:14:32.880 --> 0:14:40.640
Actually, while I tend to forget that OpenSSF was created two months before log for shell,

157
0:14:40.640 --> 0:14:41.640
not after.

158
0:14:41.640 --> 0:14:48.680
Although the Linux Foundation was pretty well positioned to help and corral a response,

159
0:14:48.680 --> 0:14:51.200
at least from the US government.

160
0:14:51.200 --> 0:14:57.360
We had several meetings at the White House, acting really as a sort of convening power

161
0:14:57.360 --> 0:15:00.560
also for the large technology companies.

162
0:15:00.560 --> 0:15:11.080
And I hope we can work together on a global standard here because we're all at risk based

163
0:15:11.080 --> 0:15:15.320
on open source sustainability, really.

164
0:15:15.320 --> 0:15:23.400
And then finally, as I said, non-profit, when you talk about financial inclusion or other

165
0:15:23.400 --> 0:15:31.000
causes, you can attract also private funding, charity funding, the Mojo Lopez largely funded

166
0:15:31.000 --> 0:15:36.520
also by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

167
0:15:36.520 --> 0:15:42.800
And so what is preventing us to make an even bigger impact?

168
0:15:42.800 --> 0:15:48.480
I think there's a few reasons.

169
0:15:48.480 --> 0:15:50.680
One I just hinted to, it's open source sustainability.

170
0:15:50.680 --> 0:16:03.880
I think most of you have probably seen that comic about how often and in some cases how

171
0:16:03.880 --> 0:16:12.080
little we know about how the modern infrastructure sometimes is relying on, again, the amazing

172
0:16:12.080 --> 0:16:16.400
work of some random guy in the brass kit says that.

173
0:16:16.400 --> 0:16:27.960
I know many of you can relate to sometimes how unthankful the internet can be or the

174
0:16:27.960 --> 0:16:32.720
technology community can be when you are doing amazing work and maintaining a library that

175
0:16:32.720 --> 0:16:42.160
then turns out large corporations, governments, and technology companies rely on every day.

176
0:16:42.160 --> 0:16:49.960
And so why else, of course, log for shell, solar winds, and all the attacks that we've

177
0:16:49.960 --> 0:16:54.400
seen in the last few years have raised the profile and created organizations like Open

178
0:16:54.400 --> 0:16:59.760
SSS to really start addressing not only security but sustainability.

179
0:16:59.760 --> 0:17:03.520
This remains a big problem.

180
0:17:03.520 --> 0:17:09.880
Also because of lack or uneven funding across the world.

181
0:17:09.880 --> 0:17:16.640
As I said, I had the luck finally in my career to start being paid to do open source.

182
0:17:16.640 --> 0:17:19.200
And it's a beautiful thing.

183
0:17:19.200 --> 0:17:26.800
I never had to really struggle to do what I love so much doing.

184
0:17:26.800 --> 0:17:31.080
And a little caveat here.

185
0:17:31.080 --> 0:17:36.360
I don't come from a rich family, but they were able to make me study.

186
0:17:36.360 --> 0:17:47.080
And I think in Europe it's to an extent easier to have some of those basic rights.

187
0:17:47.080 --> 0:17:53.400
But I never, never forget that it's a privilege to be able to work in open source.

188
0:17:53.400 --> 0:17:58.620
I used to start growing up, I used to say, look, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't started

189
0:17:58.620 --> 0:18:05.480
contributing to open source with that picture with long hair.

190
0:18:05.480 --> 0:18:07.440
But it's because I had time to do it.

191
0:18:07.440 --> 0:18:18.720
There are simply people and large slices of society that don't have time or don't have

192
0:18:18.720 --> 0:18:23.240
the opportunity to be able to start contributing because they have to do three jobs to get

193
0:18:23.240 --> 0:18:25.520
to the end of the month.

194
0:18:25.520 --> 0:18:30.000
And so open source sustainability is a major issue.

195
0:18:30.000 --> 0:18:34.280
And I think we need to continue addressing it.

196
0:18:34.280 --> 0:18:37.400
And of course, a little touch on open washing.

197
0:18:37.400 --> 0:18:43.800
It is very much still a thing, especially in less mature industries.

198
0:18:43.800 --> 0:18:51.800
It's very easy and very cool to jump on the open bandwagon without truly understanding

199
0:18:51.800 --> 0:19:02.760
or actually either maliciously, meaning trying to exploit the marketing value of open source,

200
0:19:02.760 --> 0:19:09.760
or inadvertently not understanding that, yeah, you have to contribute back if you want to

201
0:19:09.760 --> 0:19:11.760
ensure a live ecosystem.

202
0:19:11.760 --> 0:19:16.000
And if you can do software as a corporate world, you can fund open source.

203
0:19:16.000 --> 0:19:20.640
You can pay your developers to work in the open.

204
0:19:20.640 --> 0:19:27.400
But I do think that the main issue is fragmentation, actually.

205
0:19:27.400 --> 0:19:37.720
This is a report that Linux Foundation Research led together with other foundations like Eclipse,

206
0:19:37.720 --> 0:19:42.240
Live Networking and Linux Foundation Europe.

207
0:19:42.240 --> 0:19:47.440
It's about really trying to understand what are the main challenges that prevent us from

208
0:19:47.440 --> 0:19:56.840
even further getting together and addressing some of the most pressing issues out there.

209
0:19:56.840 --> 0:20:01.360
This is one that is near and dear to my heart, especially as we're here in Brussels.

210
0:20:01.360 --> 0:20:09.920
And we recently started the Linux Foundation Europe in the understanding that there's a

211
0:20:09.920 --> 0:20:19.640
lot of potential to help Europe, European technology, European values, start in Europe

212
0:20:19.640 --> 0:20:24.480
but really go global through the Linux Foundation platform.

213
0:20:24.480 --> 0:20:29.400
And of course, it is all over the world.

214
0:20:29.400 --> 0:20:39.400
There's clearly a desire and a set of statements to use open source for advancing digital sovereignty,

215
0:20:39.400 --> 0:20:40.960
creating the digital commons.

216
0:20:40.960 --> 0:20:50.600
But it seems very much to me that there hasn't yet been a true set of actions that are very

217
0:20:50.600 --> 0:20:57.320
concrete in driving towards that vision.

218
0:20:57.320 --> 0:21:04.280
It's very much promoted in principle, but sometimes even well-intentioned regulations.

219
0:21:04.280 --> 0:21:07.520
I think if you were here yesterday, there's been a lot of conversations around the Cyber

220
0:21:07.520 --> 0:21:15.720
Resiliency Act and what the potential unintended consequences on open source can be and the

221
0:21:15.720 --> 0:21:20.880
burden they might create on maintainers, on foundations, while again, in principle, the

222
0:21:20.880 --> 0:21:29.720
goal was to try to address sustainability and try to address security and put some of

223
0:21:29.720 --> 0:21:32.640
the burden on the commercial companies.

224
0:21:32.640 --> 0:21:38.760
To me, it's fairly correct.

225
0:21:38.760 --> 0:21:48.240
And so you always end up with great statements, but not so much of a aligned action.

226
0:21:48.240 --> 0:21:55.480
And you have to say, OSPOs, the European Commission is an OSPO now, two days ago the Dutch government

227
0:21:55.480 --> 0:21:57.360
announced the creation of an OSPO.

228
0:21:57.360 --> 0:22:02.000
They are sort of really starting to spring out there and I think it's a construct that

229
0:22:02.000 --> 0:22:03.640
is going to help.

230
0:22:03.640 --> 0:22:10.200
But I think, again, for what I've learned from finance, you need a bottoms up and a

231
0:22:10.200 --> 0:22:19.560
top down approach here.

232
0:22:19.560 --> 0:22:24.040
So where do we go from here?

233
0:22:24.040 --> 0:22:27.800
If we want to make an ever bigger impact.

234
0:22:27.800 --> 0:22:34.000
Actually, I'm missing a slide.

235
0:22:34.000 --> 0:22:37.040
Sorry guys.

236
0:22:37.040 --> 0:22:41.960
Oh well.

237
0:22:41.960 --> 0:22:47.480
I guess I lost it.

238
0:22:47.480 --> 0:22:52.120
I think there is a couple of things that we need to look forward to.

239
0:22:52.120 --> 0:23:00.840
From understanding that open source is not the battlefield.

240
0:23:00.840 --> 0:23:07.200
We can compete on the commercial side of the house.

241
0:23:07.200 --> 0:23:16.520
We can compete on what is truly differentiating.

242
0:23:16.520 --> 0:23:23.640
But it's not the open source community where this battle should happen.

243
0:23:23.640 --> 0:23:31.920
Digital sovereignty doesn't mean building borders around open source.

244
0:23:31.920 --> 0:23:41.880
And indeed, that is also what's coming out the fragmentation report.

245
0:23:41.880 --> 0:23:45.680
Transparent open source developments are the best antidote for techno-nationalism.

246
0:23:45.680 --> 0:23:56.720
This is something that, again, despite we know there are tensions all over.

247
0:23:56.720 --> 0:23:57.720
Open source should be a bridge.

248
0:23:57.720 --> 0:24:00.640
It shouldn't be another way to divide us.

249
0:24:00.640 --> 0:24:04.920
And there are plenty of areas where we can collaborate.

250
0:24:04.920 --> 0:24:09.960
Whether it is open source infrastructure.

251
0:24:09.960 --> 0:24:16.480
Whether it is open source security.

252
0:24:16.480 --> 0:24:24.280
Whether it is intellectual property that remains a pretty regional sort of concern.

253
0:24:24.280 --> 0:24:27.280
Whether it is even broader goals.

254
0:24:27.280 --> 0:24:30.760
And that's where I'm going to go in the next slide.

255
0:24:30.760 --> 0:24:36.080
And I want to say we are asked as foundations to work better together.

256
0:24:36.080 --> 0:24:42.800
There are plenty of educational initiatives out there that we have helped the government.

257
0:24:42.800 --> 0:24:44.760
We have the TUDA group at the Linux Foundation.

258
0:24:44.760 --> 0:24:48.320
But there's OSPO++ who works a lot with the public sector.

259
0:24:48.320 --> 0:24:52.360
There is the OSPO Zone and OSPO Alliance from the Eclipse Foundation.

260
0:24:52.360 --> 0:24:58.680
If there's one objective that I have in my new tenure here in Linux Foundation Europe

261
0:24:58.680 --> 0:25:02.760
is really to bring not only governments but really start from foundation.

262
0:25:02.760 --> 0:25:14.240
This is something that we are being asked very much loudly by the ecosystem.

263
0:25:14.240 --> 0:25:18.040
And I realize this is in the U.S. up there.

264
0:25:18.040 --> 0:25:19.720
But we do have travel funding.

265
0:25:19.720 --> 0:25:27.640
But we are starting to also organize conferences and moments where we're focused on really

266
0:25:27.640 --> 0:25:31.720
educating the government into how they can help.

267
0:25:31.720 --> 0:25:36.600
Not just in words, not just in sort of grants that stop at research level, but really in

268
0:25:36.600 --> 0:25:41.880
active participation in open source projects.

269
0:25:41.880 --> 0:25:48.560
And as I said, part of the issue here is fragmentation.

270
0:25:48.560 --> 0:25:57.320
I know for a fact even within the Linux Foundation we create five or six projects every day, sorry

271
0:25:57.320 --> 0:26:00.640
every day, every quarter.

272
0:26:00.640 --> 0:26:05.480
There are thousands of projects created in GitHub every month.

273
0:26:05.480 --> 0:26:08.200
If not probably thousands.

274
0:26:08.200 --> 0:26:10.640
There's an underestimation.

275
0:26:10.640 --> 0:26:17.320
And so it behooves us and that's again what comes out from the fragmentation report to

276
0:26:17.320 --> 0:26:20.520
really do more to align projects.

277
0:26:20.520 --> 0:26:25.160
And I think I want to applaud if you guys were here yesterday morning the open source

278
0:26:25.160 --> 0:26:31.920
initiative announced their partnership with the Digital Public Goods Alliance, which is

279
0:26:31.920 --> 0:26:37.040
very much aligned to the U.N. sustainable goals.

280
0:26:37.040 --> 0:26:44.440
And at the Linux Foundation we're also trying to align our initiatives, our projects.

281
0:26:44.440 --> 0:26:50.800
Again we have, I don't know what's the current count of projects, over a thousand projects

282
0:26:50.800 --> 0:26:51.800
in the Linux Foundation.

283
0:26:51.800 --> 0:27:04.560
And I have no idea how many can address climate, can address water prices, can address energy.

284
0:27:04.560 --> 0:27:10.600
What I know is that Europe has, many of these projects are based in Europe.

285
0:27:10.600 --> 0:27:14.680
OAS Climate has a large presence in Europe.

286
0:27:14.680 --> 0:27:22.160
Agstack for agriculture and agtech and of course, elephant energy.

287
0:27:22.160 --> 0:27:32.800
Those of you who know elephant energy know that the leader recently passed away, Shirley

288
0:27:32.800 --> 0:27:34.000
Goodman.

289
0:27:34.000 --> 0:27:42.640
She was a great activist and very much seen Europe as a springboard for global climate

290
0:27:42.640 --> 0:27:44.480
action.

291
0:27:44.480 --> 0:27:49.680
And so you can certainly expect from us a much stronger alignment towards sustainability.

292
0:27:49.680 --> 0:27:56.080
In fact, again unfortunately the CFP closes today, so if you're quick you can probably

293
0:27:56.080 --> 0:27:57.080
still sneak it in.

294
0:27:57.080 --> 0:28:04.320
But we are adding another track to our open source summit, which is sustainability.

295
0:28:04.320 --> 0:28:10.560
Again in the spirit of trying to at least have our house in Hordur and then hopefully

296
0:28:10.560 --> 0:28:19.600
are collaborating more broadly on the 17 silver high value goals.

297
0:28:19.600 --> 0:28:28.400
And then I think another way to go beyond standard, beyond this fragmentation is really,

298
0:28:28.400 --> 0:28:36.240
and I'm sure again this is not a new comic strip.

299
0:28:36.240 --> 0:28:43.680
I've taken part in standards, I've taken part in open source projects over time and hopefully

300
0:28:43.680 --> 0:28:49.200
I don't offend anyone here, but I think open source is better.

301
0:28:49.200 --> 0:28:58.040
I mean it's just more apt to incremental progress.

302
0:28:58.040 --> 0:29:06.200
You can always fork later if you don't agree, but ultimately it allows to build on an existing

303
0:29:06.200 --> 0:29:16.040
concrete piece of code rather than coming up with yet another top down 15th standard

304
0:29:16.040 --> 0:29:19.760
whereby 14 do exist.

305
0:29:19.760 --> 0:29:26.640
I think this is something that also impacts how we collaborate as individuals.

306
0:29:26.640 --> 0:29:33.640
One hand, look, one of the things that came out of the fragmentation report is that fragmentation

307
0:29:33.640 --> 0:29:34.920
is a double S word.

308
0:29:34.920 --> 0:29:43.240
Sure we want consolidation, but on the other hand there is value in the distributed mode

309
0:29:43.240 --> 0:29:51.080
of open source development whereby we want to allow multiple options to solve the same

310
0:29:51.080 --> 0:29:59.240
problem, and then open source Darwinism is going to run its course.

311
0:29:59.240 --> 0:30:04.880
I do also think that it beholds us as developers, I guess, I don't know if I can call myself

312
0:30:04.880 --> 0:30:11.880
a developer anymore, to try harder, to try harder not to reinvent the wheel.

313
0:30:11.880 --> 0:30:21.320
Again I keep aging myself, but I used to be the maiden guy before going into the foundation

314
0:30:21.320 --> 0:30:25.160
world and I got so much crap from the ant guys.

315
0:30:25.160 --> 0:30:30.640
Dude, what are you doing, this is not what you should be, it's very polarizing.

316
0:30:30.640 --> 0:30:36.440
I'm like yeah sure, we know it's not perfect, but how about we try to consolidate and improve

317
0:30:36.440 --> 0:30:41.480
rather than creating yet another framework or yet another library.

318
0:30:41.480 --> 0:30:50.560
Again, sometimes there's perfectly valuable reasons to do so.

319
0:30:50.560 --> 0:30:54.560
How do we bring it all together?

320
0:30:54.560 --> 0:31:01.840
This is a very similar slide to the one that we've seen before on finance and the lesson

321
0:31:01.840 --> 0:31:08.160
that I've learned is that it's important to start with why.

322
0:31:08.160 --> 0:31:16.200
By why I mean not only the conscience aspect of open source, but we all I think if we're

323
0:31:16.200 --> 0:31:24.960
here are familiar with, are driven by, but if we want I think to truly make an even bigger

324
0:31:24.960 --> 0:31:31.080
impact and a more focused impact on whether it is those major social goals and sustainability

325
0:31:31.080 --> 0:31:38.840
development goals, whether it is starting to change an industry, finance, healthcare

326
0:31:38.840 --> 0:31:44.640
is one that of course is near and dear to my heart and due to many reasons it's still

327
0:31:44.640 --> 0:31:53.000
very close, sometimes they hide behind the regulated nature to enact change, but the

328
0:31:53.000 --> 0:31:58.160
reality is that as we've seen for banks this is actually possible.

329
0:31:58.160 --> 0:32:06.280
Whether it is to make the government understand what they should be practically doing in an

330
0:32:06.280 --> 0:32:18.280
open source project to advance a certain policy, there's so much at least in the EU talk about

331
0:32:18.280 --> 0:32:25.080
open source and how open source can advance European small and medium businesses and innovation

332
0:32:25.080 --> 0:32:31.320
and that really does need to be translated into action.

333
0:32:31.320 --> 0:32:38.400
So I think independent organizations like foundations, or just the Linux Foundation,

334
0:32:38.400 --> 0:32:44.880
any foundation out there and hopefully better collaborating with each other, is a way to

335
0:32:44.880 --> 0:32:48.080
bring all these different actors together.

336
0:32:48.080 --> 0:32:54.280
Still with the principles of open source, but I think if we lead with that we're going

337
0:32:54.280 --> 0:33:00.960
to lose some people on the way, we're going to lose the people that really are there for

338
0:33:00.960 --> 0:33:13.320
the money or for a cause or unfortunately not everyone has this natural driver to collaborate

339
0:33:13.320 --> 0:33:20.760
and so you always need to try and sell it, I know it's a dirty word to an extent, but

340
0:33:20.760 --> 0:33:26.360
sell the reasons and the value why people would want to participate in open source and

341
0:33:26.360 --> 0:33:35.160
to me bringing everyone together under common governance is really the way forward.

342
0:33:35.160 --> 0:33:43.200
And so, about to wrap, what can we do, can you do practically to help?

343
0:33:43.200 --> 0:33:48.880
I think from our side there is much more work in being organized and collaborate and aligned

344
0:33:48.880 --> 0:33:52.640
to common goals on the foundation's side.

345
0:33:52.640 --> 0:34:05.240
But I think if anyone here is from the public sector and the EU or listening online, open

346
0:34:05.240 --> 0:34:10.240
source can be the vehicle to drive policy goals.

347
0:34:10.240 --> 0:34:19.560
I mean there's so much that we can bridge if we start with open governance and I think

348
0:34:19.560 --> 0:34:26.000
we're not going to be there probably this year or even next year, but I see a moment

349
0:34:26.000 --> 0:34:32.240
in which like I've seen with banks we can involve or why not?

350
0:34:32.240 --> 0:34:39.440
The government should be able to start open source projects that contextually drive these

351
0:34:39.440 --> 0:34:45.160
big policy goals whether it is DNA, DSA, the cyber resiliency act, the interoperability

352
0:34:45.160 --> 0:34:51.120
act, there's so much out there that Europe in fact is leading.

353
0:34:51.120 --> 0:35:01.200
I think about GDPR, I live in California and thanks to GDPR we have CCPA which is the most

354
0:35:01.200 --> 0:35:14.440
similar sort of data privacy protection in another wise pretty wild landscape and at

355
0:35:14.440 --> 0:35:20.000
the level of consumer protection that's really, you know, it's in the standard setting from

356
0:35:20.000 --> 0:35:26.080
the EU and on the other hand it makes very complex for companies to implement it and

357
0:35:26.080 --> 0:35:31.800
so open source can really deliver as a positive sum game an easier way to implement for the

358
0:35:31.800 --> 0:35:38.520
regulated industries and a more effective way for the government to enact those policies.

359
0:35:38.520 --> 0:35:45.760
Of course I will continue reiterating that digital sovereignty doesn't mean building

360
0:35:45.760 --> 0:35:46.760
borders.

361
0:35:46.760 --> 0:35:50.440
We don't want to fragment the open source community.

362
0:35:50.440 --> 0:35:57.680
We're going to as Europeans not only lose existing technology is out there but potentially

363
0:35:57.680 --> 0:36:07.320
lose sort of the innovation and the growth potential for the local small and medium businesses

364
0:36:07.320 --> 0:36:09.400
and hopefully growing businesses.

365
0:36:09.400 --> 0:36:18.600
I would like to see larger technology companies in Europe being born out of open source.

366
0:36:18.600 --> 0:36:23.640
The companies invest in open source talent.

367
0:36:23.640 --> 0:36:32.600
Again I have a lot of grievances in the United States but they do invest in talent and that

368
0:36:32.600 --> 0:36:40.080
does allow maintainers to work in open source without having to struggle and that also has

369
0:36:40.080 --> 0:36:43.480
a diversity angle here.

370
0:36:43.480 --> 0:36:51.240
Just folks that cannot in many parts of the world don't have the time to just invest in

371
0:36:51.240 --> 0:36:59.160
open source, to just do it in their own time.

372
0:36:59.160 --> 0:37:05.000
And becoming open source leader I do think that like we've seen for the examples of Google

373
0:37:05.000 --> 0:37:10.800
I was actually talking to a company here yesterday, a local company said we wouldn't even be in

374
0:37:10.800 --> 0:37:15.360
the market if it was not for open source.

375
0:37:15.360 --> 0:37:18.840
That's what got us on the global stage.

376
0:37:18.840 --> 0:37:25.240
And I think if anyone here has the decision making power, if you're trying to sell your

377
0:37:25.240 --> 0:37:33.800
CEO into doing open source, lead with why, lead with how they can commoditize a competitor,

378
0:37:33.800 --> 0:37:39.600
they can become a de facto standard.

379
0:37:39.600 --> 0:37:48.200
And then if you're not able as a company to contribute time or code, well contribute money

380
0:37:48.200 --> 0:37:59.320
to open source through maintainer funding, you know, we have Patreon, GitHub sponsors,

381
0:37:59.320 --> 0:38:04.840
the index foundation as a mentorship platform, there's so many ways to fund open source.

382
0:38:04.840 --> 0:38:12.320
It doesn't have to be foundations, it doesn't have to be directly employing someone.

383
0:38:12.320 --> 0:38:22.600
And then last but not least as an individual, I think you have an amazing potential to be

384
0:38:22.600 --> 0:38:26.200
an activist through technology.

385
0:38:26.200 --> 0:38:30.320
And being an activist I think some of the most successful activists out there are not

386
0:38:30.320 --> 0:38:33.440
just about the quality of the code.

387
0:38:33.440 --> 0:38:38.680
You got to market what you're doing and we're here to help.

388
0:38:38.680 --> 0:38:44.600
I can't promise they will be able to market or promote every single open source project

389
0:38:44.600 --> 0:38:46.600
out there.

390
0:38:46.600 --> 0:38:54.280
Been working on this deck until 3 a.m. yesterday and got here 10 minutes late this morning.

391
0:38:54.280 --> 0:39:00.760
But we're there to give visibility to a lot of these projects.

392
0:39:00.760 --> 0:39:08.760
And culture remains still a major fragmentation problem in the industry.

393
0:39:08.760 --> 0:39:13.760
The slide that unfortunately I wasn't able to present showed how there's still a lot

394
0:39:13.760 --> 0:39:14.760
of prejudice.

395
0:39:14.760 --> 0:39:22.560
And so whether it's national, whether it's racial, whether it's political, check it

396
0:39:22.560 --> 0:39:31.520
out the door because it's just not going to, you know, that diverse perspective make better

397
0:39:31.520 --> 0:39:34.080
projects.

398
0:39:34.080 --> 0:39:40.280
And then as a guy with a big ego, this is more of a lesson for myself, put your ego

399
0:39:40.280 --> 0:39:41.280
aside.

400
0:39:41.280 --> 0:39:50.080
If there is, you know, I know as an engineer at heart I have very strong opinions of how

401
0:39:50.080 --> 0:39:57.080
code should be written or how, you know, certain libraries should be done.

402
0:39:57.080 --> 0:40:00.600
There's plenty of reasons why you want to start a new framework.

403
0:40:00.600 --> 0:40:04.880
But there's the whole, there's a world of open source out there.

404
0:40:04.880 --> 0:40:12.280
And we as foundations can do a much better job at showing what projects are healthy,

405
0:40:12.280 --> 0:40:15.200
what projects are aligned with certain goals.

406
0:40:15.200 --> 0:40:18.760
We have a lot to do there.

407
0:40:18.760 --> 0:40:24.040
But if we want to really make that bigger impact, we will need commitment from you guys

408
0:40:24.040 --> 0:40:28.440
to sort of put your ego on the side.

409
0:40:28.440 --> 0:40:31.520
And with that, thank you so much.

410
0:40:31.520 --> 0:40:38.280
I appreciate you being here so early and coping with me being a little late.

411
0:40:38.280 --> 0:40:39.280
Thank you.

412
0:40:39.280 --> 0:40:40.280
I know if there are questions.

413
0:40:40.280 --> 0:40:48.960
Thank you.
