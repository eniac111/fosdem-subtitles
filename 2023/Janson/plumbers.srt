1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.240
So, it's been a while since I've been in FOSDAM and one of the things that I, well I usually

2
0:00:13.240 --> 0:00:19.360
talk about technical topics but this is really me talking about sort of using open source

3
0:00:19.360 --> 0:00:25.200
instead of producing it which is quite an unusual position for me to be in.

4
0:00:25.200 --> 0:00:33.080
I work most often in things like the Linux kernel, I also work in open source politics

5
0:00:33.080 --> 0:00:38.000
so I did a lot of kernel interaction with the Linux Foundation and one of those pieces

6
0:00:38.000 --> 0:00:43.080
of interaction was actually being a founding member of Linux Plumbers Conference which

7
0:00:43.080 --> 0:00:50.080
is the conference we'll actually be talking about for this presentation.

8
0:00:50.080 --> 0:00:54.840
Plumbers was basically founded in 2008 as an in-person conference and it's always been

9
0:00:54.840 --> 0:00:59.080
an in-person conference up to the pandemic years.

10
0:00:59.080 --> 0:01:03.880
It's actually organized somewhat similarly to FOSDAM in that it has tracks and what are

11
0:01:03.880 --> 0:01:05.780
called micro conferences.

12
0:01:05.780 --> 0:01:10.400
The micro conferences are similar to dev rooms except they're really a bit more interactive

13
0:01:10.400 --> 0:01:14.840
so they're really expected to do participant conversations and usually you get a cluster

14
0:01:14.840 --> 0:01:20.600
of people at the front talking to each other.

15
0:01:20.600 --> 0:01:25.960
The tracks themselves when we have them mostly tend to be presentations so very like this

16
0:01:25.960 --> 0:01:31.320
but the micro conferences tend to be very discussion based so if you think about trying

17
0:01:31.320 --> 0:01:36.080
to do that sort of hybrid and online you realize you need some sort of highly interactive video

18
0:01:36.080 --> 0:01:39.440
system which is what we went through.

19
0:01:39.440 --> 0:01:44.200
One of the good things we had for Plumbers is that the conference actually produces quite

20
0:01:44.200 --> 0:01:45.500
a lot of money.

21
0:01:45.500 --> 0:01:52.520
We have quite a lot of sponsorship so it's quite easy to pay people to do things in the

22
0:01:52.520 --> 0:01:57.200
conference and one of the things we paid for in 2018 was to actually make the conference

23
0:01:57.200 --> 0:02:02.320
live streaming for all of those who couldn't attend and also to try and put all of the

24
0:02:02.320 --> 0:02:08.040
videos of every presentation and every discussion we had up on the website and obviously to

25
0:02:08.040 --> 0:02:14.000
do that we needed to pay somebody to run AV in each of our rooms and Plumbers tends to

26
0:02:14.000 --> 0:02:21.520
run us about somewhere between four and eight simultaneous tracks so we needed about 16

27
0:02:21.520 --> 0:02:25.760
cameras to do this and about between four and eight people to stay in the room to also

28
0:02:25.760 --> 0:02:29.760
do it.

29
0:02:29.760 --> 0:02:34.200
And obviously this then included provision of cameras in the rooms and the way we set

30
0:02:34.200 --> 0:02:39.440
up cameras at Plumbers is slightly different from what you have here because in your setup

31
0:02:39.440 --> 0:02:44.360
the camera is mostly looking down at me because you think I should be the focus of attention

32
0:02:44.360 --> 0:02:50.000
which is true because I'm giving the talk but when you're actually trying to record

33
0:02:50.000 --> 0:02:55.680
an ongoing live discussion that mostly happens between people in the audience you also need

34
0:02:55.680 --> 0:02:58.120
the people who are live streaming to be able to see it.

35
0:02:58.120 --> 0:03:02.760
So one of the other fortuitous things is Plumbers is always set up with two cameras, one at

36
0:03:02.760 --> 0:03:07.840
the back looking down on the speaker and then one at the front looking out at the audience

37
0:03:07.840 --> 0:03:12.240
and the AV guys are actually responsible for switching between the front view and the back

38
0:03:12.240 --> 0:03:17.120
view so that when we start to get conversations within the audience the camera can actually

39
0:03:17.120 --> 0:03:19.840
catch them and you can watch it.

40
0:03:19.840 --> 0:03:24.160
And this actually turned out to be really fortuitous as well.

41
0:03:24.160 --> 0:03:29.080
Obviously when you try and record your conference the first thing you realize is that in a highly

42
0:03:29.080 --> 0:03:34.560
interactive conference most people don't use the microphone and it's really annoying for

43
0:03:34.560 --> 0:03:38.920
everybody on the streaming when you get a load of silence in the room.

44
0:03:38.920 --> 0:03:43.720
So persuading people to use microphones is one of the key things that you have to do

45
0:03:43.720 --> 0:03:47.280
when you start recording your conference and this is still nothing to do with trying to

46
0:03:47.280 --> 0:03:52.720
get it live or hybrid, this is just recording the conference.

47
0:03:52.720 --> 0:03:58.040
So you have to persuade all participants in the conversation to actually use a microphone

48
0:03:58.040 --> 0:04:03.280
and however much money your conference makes you will only have a few microphones like

49
0:04:03.280 --> 0:04:08.080
this one we have two microphones at the front, I have one lavalier microphone for a room

50
0:04:08.080 --> 0:04:11.320
that could possibly seat over a thousand people.

51
0:04:11.320 --> 0:04:14.760
Trying to run around with microphones when you're doing an interactive conversation is

52
0:04:14.760 --> 0:04:18.600
really difficult as I assume the guys with the orange t-shirts will be able to tell you

53
0:04:18.600 --> 0:04:21.740
over a beer after the event.

54
0:04:21.740 --> 0:04:27.000
The solution we took was borrowed from another conference in Paris called Kernel Recipes

55
0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:33.200
which are these things called catch boxes and effectively they're square plastic polystyrene

56
0:04:33.200 --> 0:04:38.080
blobs that have a microphone inside that you can throw from one end of a conference room

57
0:04:38.080 --> 0:04:42.640
to another and this gives you a way of actually getting the microphone between the participants

58
0:04:42.640 --> 0:04:50.660
very fast and it's definitely fun to use and they do encourage participation.

59
0:04:50.660 --> 0:04:56.240
So far we've had no injuries, I should actually qualify, we've actually had no serious injuries

60
0:04:56.240 --> 0:05:00.360
so far with people throwing microphones at each other but I assume there's always a first

61
0:05:00.360 --> 0:05:04.000
time.

62
0:05:04.000 --> 0:05:09.000
And the idea was really to try and make the conference that we were running available

63
0:05:09.000 --> 0:05:13.920
in real time to people who can't participate because you know it's a kernel development

64
0:05:13.920 --> 0:05:18.440
conference we get people who want to come from all over the globe and we always have

65
0:05:18.440 --> 0:05:22.560
corners of the globe especially when we run the conference in America that even if they

66
0:05:22.560 --> 0:05:26.240
have the best will in the world and they can actually scrape up the money to come they're

67
0:05:26.240 --> 0:05:33.560
often denied visas by the US authorities so it can be a real really difficult problem.

68
0:05:33.560 --> 0:05:38.880
And for our first attempts at doing this the communication was really only outbound so

69
0:05:38.880 --> 0:05:42.640
the remote participants could watch what was going on in the room but they couldn't really

70
0:05:42.640 --> 0:05:45.800
participate.

71
0:05:45.800 --> 0:05:53.240
And obviously this all changed in 2000 when we got to the pandemic years.

72
0:05:53.240 --> 0:05:57.400
Like all other conferences plumbers moved to being fully online.

73
0:05:57.400 --> 0:06:02.000
We didn't, we were actually in the year 2000 we already booked a venue up in Halifax Nova

74
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:07.240
Scotia, we had a huge amount of fun trying to get out of that venue contract when it

75
0:06:07.240 --> 0:06:11.360
emerged that we couldn't actually hold the conference up there and then we all had to

76
0:06:11.360 --> 0:06:14.660
scramble to try and actually do this fully online.

77
0:06:14.660 --> 0:06:20.120
So this is where the story becomes quite interesting because there are ten people on plumbers committee

78
0:06:20.120 --> 0:06:27.800
Mike Rappaport over here is one of them because of the origin we are primarily kernel developers

79
0:06:27.800 --> 0:06:32.600
and because we're moving fully online effectively kernel developers are becoming responsible

80
0:06:32.600 --> 0:06:37.600
for web programming because what we're really doing is setting up a distributed set of web

81
0:06:37.600 --> 0:06:45.040
services and if you know kernel developers we mostly tend to theoretically look down

82
0:06:45.040 --> 0:06:49.240
on web developers because obviously the kernel development is at the hard core of everything

83
0:06:49.240 --> 0:06:56.560
so this is somewhat a story of how a bunch of kernel developers tried to do web and failed

84
0:06:56.560 --> 0:07:05.320
a bit, screwed up quite a lot and eventually got it working by the seat of their pants.

85
0:07:05.320 --> 0:07:10.760
We evaluated a load of options for actually going fully online as every conference did,

86
0:07:10.760 --> 0:07:16.840
they scrambled to, we discussed it a lot with other conferences, people had different ideas,

87
0:07:16.840 --> 0:07:21.720
we were actually under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation and they're a much more commercial

88
0:07:21.720 --> 0:07:27.360
entity than we are, we're still volunteer run even pulling a lot of money, their idea

89
0:07:27.360 --> 0:07:33.080
was just to pay somebody to do the solutions and frankly in the early days that looked

90
0:07:33.080 --> 0:07:37.040
like a good idea to us, if you can just pay money to get rid of the problem why wouldn't

91
0:07:37.040 --> 0:07:44.440
you and we have enough money, we've got almost a million dollars in the bank now for plumbers,

92
0:07:44.440 --> 0:07:48.520
we could afford to spend a lot of that money to actually pay for somebody to sort out these

93
0:07:48.520 --> 0:07:53.320
problems and the Linux Foundation tried to do it for several conferences and we looked

94
0:07:53.320 --> 0:07:58.420
at their solution and went you know this is terrible, I mean why is it so difficult and

95
0:07:58.420 --> 0:08:05.560
so bad trying to run a conference and so the only way we could actually foresee getting

96
0:08:05.560 --> 0:08:11.040
this working is if we just abandoned all of the commercial solutions and did it ourselves

97
0:08:11.040 --> 0:08:18.240
which is much more difficult than we imagined to actually do but the goal of this was that

98
0:08:18.240 --> 0:08:24.120
we definitely needed in our online conference to have two way video interaction in real

99
0:08:24.120 --> 0:08:29.160
time between the participants, that was the goal and there was no real conference system

100
0:08:29.160 --> 0:08:34.520
that did that, if you've tried holding conferences over zoom you can just about do it but things

101
0:08:34.520 --> 0:08:41.360
like BBB actually do an awful lot better than this and the other thing we discovered is

102
0:08:41.360 --> 0:08:47.640
that when you're running a collection of web services it really is all about the integrations.

103
0:08:47.640 --> 0:08:52.920
Open source gives you a lot of excellent pieces so we use big blue button, we use indico for

104
0:08:52.920 --> 0:08:57.400
the conference scheduling, eventually we use matrix for the track, we didn't use it in

105
0:08:57.400 --> 0:09:03.000
the first year but there's also a downside to that, whenever you try and integrate web

106
0:09:03.000 --> 0:09:10.000
services you always write a set of glue around them that needs to be maintained and if there

107
0:09:10.000 --> 0:09:13.920
are a load of disparate services that aren't used to talking to each other it does the

108
0:09:13.920 --> 0:09:18.920
impedance matching between the services and as the years go by and remember this is a

109
0:09:18.920 --> 0:09:23.700
conference so we put it on once a year, every year you upgrade to the new versions and suddenly

110
0:09:23.700 --> 0:09:27.800
your glue doesn't work again so it always becomes a maintenance nightmare to get the

111
0:09:27.800 --> 0:09:37.840
glue working. So if you ever came to the plumbers conference the web front end that you first

112
0:09:37.840 --> 0:09:44.360
see if you go to meet.lpc.events is a piece of code that John Corbett wrote in Python

113
0:09:44.360 --> 0:09:51.720
and Django called the Linux plumbers conference front end, LPCFE, oh and I should add that

114
0:09:51.720 --> 0:09:56.840
these things here are clickable URLs so if you go to the presentation and you want to

115
0:09:56.840 --> 0:10:03.840
know where it is you can just hover over it and it will tell you. Obviously green light

116
0:10:03.840 --> 0:10:11.600
is actually the way you log people onto BBB so by replacing green light in big blue button

117
0:10:11.600 --> 0:10:18.180
we've effectively taken on the job ourselves of doing integration, authentication, user

118
0:10:18.180 --> 0:10:24.920
management and pretty much everything else, this is actually a major replacement of services

119
0:10:24.920 --> 0:10:29.640
on big blue button and the reason we did this is because we needed an integration with our

120
0:10:29.640 --> 0:10:34.800
conference timetable, we just wanted the conference timetable to display on the first screen with

121
0:10:34.800 --> 0:10:39.280
a little button that said click here to go to this session, it's very like you have in

122
0:10:39.280 --> 0:10:44.360
FOSDAM with the matrix chat, if you just click on the integration of the matrix chat it brings

123
0:10:44.360 --> 0:10:48.040
up the live stream and you can see what's going on in the conference, we wanted it to

124
0:10:48.040 --> 0:10:54.080
work pretty much as it does here and green light just wouldn't do that for us because

125
0:10:54.080 --> 0:10:58.560
green light was designed to be a teaching front end for a single classroom, it wasn't

126
0:10:58.560 --> 0:11:09.800
really thinking about multiple tracks, multiple track rooms and timetable integration. So

127
0:11:09.800 --> 0:11:16.600
we also, by getting rid of all of the attendee credentials, we actually had to integrate

128
0:11:16.600 --> 0:11:21.800
with some sort of authentication server that could be distributed, so being kernel developers

129
0:11:21.800 --> 0:11:25.920
because we chose LDAT because it's the oldest one and it's the one everybody has the most

130
0:11:25.920 --> 0:11:32.800
trouble with, so we should be able to use it right. The credentials were the email address

131
0:11:32.800 --> 0:11:37.920
that you used to register with the conference which is easy and the password was just the

132
0:11:37.920 --> 0:11:43.200
confirmation number because fortunately the Linux Foundation's CVAN system spits out these

133
0:11:43.200 --> 0:11:47.160
long confirmation numbers and they're all guaranteed to be unique, so that's obviously

134
0:11:47.160 --> 0:11:54.280
really easy. Problem, again, integration. The CVAN system will not speak to anything

135
0:11:54.280 --> 0:12:02.880
outside CVAN, so if you register for the conference and you don't automatically show up in the

136
0:12:02.880 --> 0:12:08.320
LDAP database, what has to happen is I have to go to the CVAN website and export a spreadsheet

137
0:12:08.320 --> 0:12:13.720
of all of the users, figure out which are new ones and then feed the details into the

138
0:12:13.720 --> 0:12:19.080
LDAP server, which, I mean, as an offline activity it sounds really simple. It becomes

139
0:12:19.080 --> 0:12:24.120
really complicated when you keep getting people who don't register until the last minute of

140
0:12:24.120 --> 0:12:29.160
the conference, turn up halfway through a session, want to register and then immediately

141
0:12:29.160 --> 0:12:34.300
be able to see what the hell is going on and they have to wait for, I don't know how long

142
0:12:34.300 --> 0:12:38.280
for somebody to actually put their credentials in the database and when you're running a

143
0:12:38.280 --> 0:12:43.300
conference pretty much all of your attendees are running around, all of your organizers

144
0:12:43.300 --> 0:12:47.720
are running around full time, nobody has time to tend the back end of the database and that

145
0:12:47.720 --> 0:12:55.560
became a bottleneck for certain people. So my request of you is if you ever get into

146
0:12:55.560 --> 0:13:02.520
this situation, register early, please, don't turn up at the last minute, it's much easier.

147
0:13:02.520 --> 0:13:08.500
Then the next problem is that nobody is actually really used to interacting online. I mean,

148
0:13:08.500 --> 0:13:12.560
you think it's easy, you've seen Zoom calls, you all just turn up and you've got, you know,

149
0:13:12.560 --> 0:13:16.880
pieces of each other on it. If you try and do that with 800 people, Zoom doesn't really

150
0:13:16.880 --> 0:13:23.960
do auto focus very well. You can't see who's talking and if you're just observing the conference

151
0:13:23.960 --> 0:13:31.200
it just becomes a mass of faces and it's completely useless. So we obviously have standard issues

152
0:13:31.200 --> 0:13:36.880
like good webcam, good microphone. The number of people probably among you sitting in this

153
0:13:36.880 --> 0:13:41.800
room who think that the standard set of speakers on your Dell system when you just open the

154
0:13:41.800 --> 0:13:46.840
laptop will do when you're chatting to each other, believe me it won't. The thing that

155
0:13:46.840 --> 0:13:53.360
audiences hate the most in online conferences is static, background noise, indistinctness,

156
0:13:53.360 --> 0:13:57.760
being unable to get the point across. If you don't have in the attendees who are going

157
0:13:57.760 --> 0:14:03.440
to interact good AV equipment, this is the thing which actually makes the conference

158
0:14:03.440 --> 0:14:09.400
experience go down the fastest. This is about the only thing we got right because we gave

159
0:14:09.400 --> 0:14:14.200
us speaker gifts designed to be delivered to anywhere in the world a month before the

160
0:14:14.200 --> 0:14:20.760
conference, a complete gift pack of headset lights so you could actually see the face

161
0:14:20.760 --> 0:14:25.440
and a webcam you could put on the top of your camera, a 1080p webcam so we were sure that

162
0:14:25.440 --> 0:14:30.200
we'd actually have a good view of the speakers. We made sure that they got to all of our nearly

163
0:14:30.200 --> 0:14:35.240
100 speakers in the conference and most of them didn't use them which was a bit of a

164
0:14:35.240 --> 0:14:41.600
problem. We also found as I've explained with Zoom that raised hands don't work and having

165
0:14:41.600 --> 0:14:46.640
a load of people on video who you have no idea what's going on doesn't work either.

166
0:14:46.640 --> 0:14:51.040
So the thing we pioneered for plumbers is called video muting which is where we try

167
0:14:51.040 --> 0:14:56.520
and instruct the attendees to if you're just watching don't turn your camera on. So pretty

168
0:14:56.520 --> 0:15:00.560
much it's a blank screen. The only people who turn their camera on are people who are

169
0:15:00.560 --> 0:15:04.800
talking or people who are waiting to talk so it actually gives a good visual clue that

170
0:15:04.800 --> 0:15:09.320
somebody wants to interject at this point and we found it was actually a reasonably

171
0:15:09.320 --> 0:15:14.640
good way of facilitating interaction in an online conference and it certainly solves

172
0:15:14.640 --> 0:15:19.920
the Zoom confusion where you just can't figure out who's talking to whom on your screen of

173
0:15:19.920 --> 0:15:24.800
and for the online conference we did have about 900 attendees so you could imagine on

174
0:15:24.800 --> 0:15:33.340
a Zoom screen everybody would probably get about 5 pixels. In 2020, Big Blue Button comes

175
0:15:33.340 --> 0:15:38.400
with an internal chat system which means anybody logged into Big Blue Button can pop out a

176
0:15:38.400 --> 0:15:43.880
chat tab at the side and they'll be able to chat with anybody who's logged into the conference.

177
0:15:43.880 --> 0:15:49.120
So this is why if you were doing streaming of the conference you couldn't interact because

178
0:15:49.120 --> 0:15:55.600
that is a completely enclosed chat system. But we realized that people wanted to have

179
0:15:55.600 --> 0:16:00.420
conversations outside the discussion rooms as well, things like hallway tracks. So we

180
0:16:00.420 --> 0:16:05.560
actually adopted a, it's a sort of open source project called Rocket Chat. Now the core of

181
0:16:05.560 --> 0:16:10.800
the project is fully open sourced but Rocket Chat themselves runs a more open core model

182
0:16:10.800 --> 0:16:14.720
where there are certain enterprise upsells and everything but this was just the one we

183
0:16:14.720 --> 0:16:19.580
came across. And the good thing for us is it doesn't require any integration because

184
0:16:19.580 --> 0:16:24.480
we'd already started to realize the more integrations you do, the more difficulty you have, the

185
0:16:24.480 --> 0:16:30.440
more strings and balen wire stuff there is to go wrong at the crunch time when you put

186
0:16:30.440 --> 0:16:35.480
the conference on. So no integration looked like a good thing until we tried to run the

187
0:16:35.480 --> 0:16:41.080
conference. And then the problems were that chat was hard to read on the live stream because

188
0:16:41.080 --> 0:16:46.240
we're streaming it out pretty much through YouTube. We actually, Guy Lunardi wrote a

189
0:16:46.240 --> 0:16:51.080
streaming module for BVB and we just plugged it in as an additional attendee and what it

190
0:16:51.080 --> 0:16:57.000
saw was what we streamed to YouTube. And the problem is that YouTube does dynamic compression

191
0:16:57.000 --> 0:17:02.200
of most of the stuff while it's streaming and if you have a low bandwidth connection

192
0:17:02.200 --> 0:17:06.480
it will quite happily Greek all of the chat that's going on and you just can't see what

193
0:17:06.480 --> 0:17:13.480
is going on on the chat. Whereas, you know, if it's sort of having a bandwidth problem

194
0:17:13.480 --> 0:17:18.320
with faces and you're just looking at lips moving, you can stand losing quite a few pixels

195
0:17:18.320 --> 0:17:24.880
but if you're trying to follow chat it's just impossible. And obviously streamers didn't

196
0:17:24.880 --> 0:17:28.840
have any credentials to the RocketChat anyway because we based it on our LDAP. If you're

197
0:17:28.840 --> 0:17:32.520
not registered for the conference you have no chat credentials. So they couldn't join

198
0:17:32.520 --> 0:17:37.200
the hallway track either which they didn't like. This was the problem. And the third

199
0:17:37.200 --> 0:17:41.240
problem was we had to buy an enterprise license from RocketChat actually to get some of the

200
0:17:41.240 --> 0:17:48.800
notifications that we used for integration to work. And the two chat systems were completely

201
0:17:48.800 --> 0:17:54.080
and fully disconnected. So you couldn't use your RocketChat login to look at the BBB chat

202
0:17:54.080 --> 0:18:00.320
and vice versa which also was a bit balkanizing and a bit annoying for people. And so you

203
0:18:00.320 --> 0:18:04.440
can see that the thing I initially portrayed as a huge advantage because we didn't have

204
0:18:04.440 --> 0:18:08.920
to worry about the integration was the thing that everybody found the biggest disadvantage

205
0:18:08.920 --> 0:18:14.000
about the conference because it wasn't integrated. So you always get this pressure of, and you

206
0:18:14.000 --> 0:18:18.760
know as conference organizers, the more integration you do the more chance there is that something

207
0:18:18.760 --> 0:18:24.160
will go wrong. But if you don't do enough integration your audience don't like it. So

208
0:18:24.160 --> 0:18:30.520
you have to get the amount of integration right. And for several conferences we actually

209
0:18:30.520 --> 0:18:38.840
struggled to do this. Every registered attendee got a matrix ID and since we used email and

210
0:18:38.840 --> 0:18:45.120
confirmation number to login we figured we just use email address matrix as well. But

211
0:18:45.120 --> 0:18:50.000
there's a slight problem here. Emails contain an at sign. Matrix does not like additional

212
0:18:50.000 --> 0:18:55.280
at signs in your ID so we had to replace the at sign with a full stop which I thought,

213
0:18:55.280 --> 0:18:58.960
oh it could be easy for our attendees. They're all computer geeks. They'll get this. They'll

214
0:18:58.960 --> 0:19:04.200
know email address for one server, email address but with at sign substitutes with dot for

215
0:19:04.200 --> 0:19:10.080
another server. Complete disaster. You know they just couldn't figure out which ID correctly

216
0:19:10.080 --> 0:19:17.280
to use for which. Eventually we got the BBB server to use either form of the address and

217
0:19:17.280 --> 0:19:22.040
we actually got the matrix server to translate using a JavaScript widget. If they typed in

218
0:19:22.040 --> 0:19:25.800
the email address it would just fill in the dot and everything would just work. We tried

219
0:19:25.800 --> 0:19:32.720
it without doing that for a couple of days and got a bucket full of complaints. I should

220
0:19:32.720 --> 0:19:40.640
also add that when we chose Rocket Chat in 2020 I wasn't very happy about the decision

221
0:19:40.640 --> 0:19:46.040
because I was a fledgling matrix user and I was sure that matrix could handle the conference

222
0:19:46.040 --> 0:19:51.200
and I thought it would actually be a good idea to do this. So I'd advocated even in

223
0:19:51.200 --> 0:19:56.680
2020 that we should be using matrix and finally after all the difficulty with Rocket Chat

224
0:19:56.680 --> 0:20:04.880
in 2021 I got my wish. So they told me we're using matrix and you're in charge which was

225
0:20:04.880 --> 0:20:10.080
fun until the first day came along and the matrix server with 900 people on it just fell

226
0:20:10.080 --> 0:20:16.980
over. And we had actually done scaling testing. I mean I'm not naive. I know things can go

227
0:20:16.980 --> 0:20:22.560
wrong at scale that you know you don't see in your own lab. So we'd invited everybody

228
0:20:22.560 --> 0:20:27.760
to come along for a town hall but only 100 people showed up and it turned out that most

229
0:20:27.760 --> 0:20:32.720
of the scaling problems we had were somewhere between 100 and 900. So we hadn't hit any

230
0:20:32.720 --> 0:20:41.800
of them in our little test. And I'd also tried to scale up the matrix server so our massive

231
0:20:41.800 --> 0:20:49.000
16 CPU system that we were paying you know about $100 a month for when you ran top on

232
0:20:49.000 --> 0:20:53.760
it was only using one CPU because I hadn't realized that matrix synapse which was the

233
0:20:53.760 --> 0:21:01.560
server we chose was single threaded. I mean who in 2021 writes a single threaded web application

234
0:21:01.560 --> 0:21:07.340
but the matrix people thread matrix by using the back end web server through a sequence

235
0:21:07.340 --> 0:21:13.320
of proxies to actually do this but that is not the default configuration. And so on the

236
0:21:13.320 --> 0:21:18.120
Monday of the conference I was left there in my own little basement sweating away going

237
0:21:18.120 --> 0:21:22.920
how the hell do I scale this thing. But fortunately several people who attended FOSDEM which did

238
0:21:22.920 --> 0:21:28.760
use matrix before we did also ran into this problem and they were able to send me email

239
0:21:28.760 --> 0:21:34.040
saying yeah we've got this guy you can talk to he'll teach you how to do it. So fortunately

240
0:21:34.040 --> 0:21:40.240
within about four hours of discovering the problem and realizing it didn't scale we had

241
0:21:40.240 --> 0:21:45.400
a roughly scaling matrix server working and I managed to actually complete the scaling

242
0:21:45.400 --> 0:21:51.000
by the end of the first day so for the second day matrix was actually fully functional fortunately

243
0:21:51.000 --> 0:21:56.980
since it was my little baby. And I actually did a little blog post about how we got this

244
0:21:56.980 --> 0:22:01.680
to work just so if anybody else ever runs into the problems there are online resources

245
0:22:01.680 --> 0:22:07.760
to go to to get yourselves out of it. One of the good things about using matrix was

246
0:22:07.760 --> 0:22:13.040
that even the free tier attendees the streaming tier attendees could now actually interact

247
0:22:13.040 --> 0:22:18.800
by chat. So anybody with their own matrix ID could log on to any of our matrix rooms

248
0:22:18.800 --> 0:22:23.280
because they're all public in the same way that all the FOSDEM rooms are public. Every

249
0:22:23.280 --> 0:22:29.520
attendee still got their own separated matrix ID but that you only got logged onto the matrix

250
0:22:29.520 --> 0:22:36.080
ID if you actually popped up the side chat panel. You could also use your own separated

251
0:22:36.080 --> 0:22:42.200
matrix thing and use your own matrix ID as well if you wanted to. And it just depended

252
0:22:42.200 --> 0:22:50.040
how you wanted to interact with the conference. Guilinardi was the one who actually modified

253
0:22:50.040 --> 0:22:56.520
the BVB server to instead of opening its own chat tab we just stole the iframe concept

254
0:22:56.520 --> 0:23:02.480
it uses for the blackboard and we did a riot embedded which is done by some URL to the

255
0:23:02.480 --> 0:23:09.720
GitHub account is there. The integration, the riot embedded is not as good as running

256
0:23:09.720 --> 0:23:15.240
the electron type application but trying to embed an electron application into a web form

257
0:23:15.240 --> 0:23:20.700
is just a nightmare and doesn't work. So it's a very cut down version all it really does

258
0:23:20.700 --> 0:23:27.840
is text pictures and reactions. It doesn't do any of these sort of complicated threading

259
0:23:27.840 --> 0:23:33.000
or replies or anything but that's pretty much good enough for conference attendees. But

260
0:23:33.000 --> 0:23:37.280
you can see the Primrose path we're treading down because this is yet another integration

261
0:23:37.280 --> 0:23:46.120
into matrix, in a BVB in matrix that is not done by either upstream. But it was really

262
0:23:46.120 --> 0:23:55.240
useful so the streamers could see the chat if it was grieved on their streaming screen

263
0:23:55.240 --> 0:24:00.400
they could actually use a matrix client and still view the chat in real time without having

264
0:24:00.400 --> 0:24:07.080
to worry about video compression and reduction. And so we thought after we'd done this successfully

265
0:24:07.080 --> 0:24:12.800
for two years now, especially for one year with rocket chat, one year with matrix, it

266
0:24:12.800 --> 0:24:16.680
wouldn't be too difficult to move over to hybrid which is probably really the point

267
0:24:16.680 --> 0:24:25.800
of this talk. We already had all the remote infrastructure. By the way, to run this style

268
0:24:25.800 --> 0:24:29.240
of remote infrastructure for a conference the size of plumbers so we're talking about

269
0:24:29.240 --> 0:24:35.680
900 people and we assume that for the in person one we'd probably be about 400 in person,

270
0:24:35.680 --> 0:24:41.080
500 online. It will cost you somewhere between three and five thousand dollars to actually

271
0:24:41.080 --> 0:24:46.080
set up and run. It's not cheap to do the hosting of all of this stuff. Especially because we

272
0:24:46.080 --> 0:24:51.560
had to host at scale. We needed one BVB server per each track room. We had about six track

273
0:24:51.560 --> 0:24:56.320
rooms. We had a few spare servers left over for hack rooms and we had one for the hallway

274
0:24:56.320 --> 0:25:05.480
track. But the way we looked at it is we already had all of the AV necessary for actually just

275
0:25:05.480 --> 0:25:09.680
this is the naive thought which is where kernel developers go. You know, we've got AV in the

276
0:25:09.680 --> 0:25:14.320
room, it's got two cameras and it's got a load of microphones. The room is just another

277
0:25:14.320 --> 0:25:19.560
single person attending the BVB chat. It'll be easy to do it like that, the naive way

278
0:25:19.560 --> 0:25:25.520
of thinking. But it really, really is not that simple trying to get a hybrid conference

279
0:25:25.520 --> 0:25:33.240
running. The significant problem is that you have to integrate with in room AV and in room

280
0:25:33.240 --> 0:25:39.800
AV, well, okay, so at ULB you control it. But we were doing it in hotels. Hotels have

281
0:25:39.800 --> 0:25:44.440
their own local AV teams. If you touch a piece of their equipment they tend to go screaming

282
0:25:44.440 --> 0:25:49.840
to management. In order to get the integration done you can't do it yourself as the conference

283
0:25:49.840 --> 0:25:57.140
organizes. The AV people, the audio people have to do it. And it's surprising the number

284
0:25:57.140 --> 0:26:02.120
of audio people who sort of sit behind those switcher boards at the back of conferences

285
0:26:02.120 --> 0:26:07.640
who've never even seen a sort of online hybrid conference and have no idea how to set this

286
0:26:07.640 --> 0:26:13.000
up. So just plonking this sort of video display down in front of them and saying, hey, now

287
0:26:13.000 --> 0:26:18.840
you're in charge of audio and video and we just want the conference to work, wasn't actually

288
0:26:18.840 --> 0:26:26.880
a winning strategy. So we discovered rapidly and unfortunately it was pretty much on the

289
0:26:26.880 --> 0:26:32.400
day of the conference that we had to train the AV people and have to use all of this

290
0:26:32.400 --> 0:26:38.800
stuff. And we were actually quite fortunate because we'd ordered the video based AV. We

291
0:26:38.800 --> 0:26:44.560
actually had two sets of AV people. So the hotel usually supplies audio people to plug

292
0:26:44.560 --> 0:26:49.000
in your projectors and your microphones into the hotel's audio. And then we had a separate

293
0:26:49.000 --> 0:26:54.600
AV company whose job was to manage the cameras and sort of cut the whole thing together and

294
0:26:54.600 --> 0:27:00.360
do the live streaming. So we actually had two AV teams effectively and we were assuming

295
0:27:00.360 --> 0:27:04.880
that we could just co-opt the AV team who was doing the live streaming because live

296
0:27:04.880 --> 0:27:10.040
streaming, running live streaming is not much different than running an online conference,

297
0:27:10.040 --> 0:27:18.040
right? Wrong. So we held meetings beforehand with them and we talked to them about it.

298
0:27:18.040 --> 0:27:22.400
We couldn't hold meetings with the hotel audio guys but we assumed it would just be a plug

299
0:27:22.400 --> 0:27:31.320
for them, which it wasn't. And nobody really anticipated the issues that we actually had.

300
0:27:31.320 --> 0:27:36.520
Specifically the AV setup of remote attendees is not obvious to somebody who's used to dealing

301
0:27:36.520 --> 0:27:41.760
with throwing microphones around a room because there is one extra wire that's coming off

302
0:27:41.760 --> 0:27:47.140
the internet over which a lot of attendee voices can come. And the first time they set

303
0:27:47.140 --> 0:27:53.200
up their AV patch panels, this wire just wasn't plugged in. The second time it was bypassing

304
0:27:53.200 --> 0:27:58.720
all of the audio routing which meant that the sound quality and the volume was chopping

305
0:27:58.720 --> 0:28:04.120
at high strength because it wasn't being attenuated through the usual filters. I mean, this is

306
0:28:04.120 --> 0:28:09.200
the 101, you know, how many screw ups can you have? We basically did them all on the

307
0:28:09.200 --> 0:28:14.200
first day. So let's go through a list of the problems.

308
0:28:14.200 --> 0:28:22.560
Oh, I even forgot to mention that between 2001 and 2002 we decided to upgrade the whole

309
0:28:22.560 --> 0:28:27.720
of the infrastructure. We had specific things in BBB we wanted. Remember I told you we have

310
0:28:27.720 --> 0:28:33.280
two cameras. We have one at the back facing the speaker, one at the front facing the audience.

311
0:28:33.280 --> 0:28:38.040
The new version of BBB could actually handle multiple cameras with different views. So

312
0:28:38.040 --> 0:28:42.680
we figured that wouldn't it be really great if, you know, you want to see the audience

313
0:28:42.680 --> 0:28:46.560
so you just select the audience camera as a remote participant because you want to talk

314
0:28:46.560 --> 0:28:50.600
to them. Or let's say you're a remote speaker, you want to see the audience but the rest

315
0:28:50.600 --> 0:28:54.120
of the people just want to see you. We'll do this multiple camera selection. It was

316
0:28:54.120 --> 0:29:01.140
going to be the cornerstone of our implementation of this. Problem was, nobody told the AV guys.

317
0:29:01.140 --> 0:29:06.000
So the AV guys had come set up with a switcher for the two cameras which is how they ran

318
0:29:06.000 --> 0:29:10.660
the streaming because obviously you can select one camera view or the other because the live

319
0:29:10.660 --> 0:29:16.420
streaming pretty much has one camera view out on it. And by the time we all sat together

320
0:29:16.420 --> 0:29:20.680
in the room there was no way of unplugging this set up and redoing it such that we could

321
0:29:20.680 --> 0:29:25.560
plug in two video cameras because it all has to be done from the AV control deck and they

322
0:29:25.560 --> 0:29:29.940
physically didn't have another input because they were expecting to use a camera switch.

323
0:29:29.940 --> 0:29:35.160
So this is yet another screw up in planning. Third screw up was because we'd upgraded to

324
0:29:35.160 --> 0:29:42.440
the newer BVB. They'd redone the, and this uses Node React as the frame backbone. They'd

325
0:29:42.440 --> 0:29:47.840
redone the way it was working. Riot embedded no longer worked as a Popout panel. We discovered

326
0:29:47.840 --> 0:29:53.120
this fortunately four days before the conference. So this was Guy Lenardi doing a very quick

327
0:29:53.120 --> 0:29:57.600
back end retrofit trying to get the matrix chat that everybody was expecting to work

328
0:29:57.600 --> 0:30:02.440
to work. And fortunately by the time we did the conference it was actually working but

329
0:30:02.440 --> 0:30:10.400
this was yet another squeaky bum issue where we tried to do everything at the last minute.

330
0:30:10.400 --> 0:30:15.020
The first day we had a lot of rooms where the room couldn't hear the remote attendees.

331
0:30:15.020 --> 0:30:20.180
This is the wire problem from the remote. Or the remote attendees couldn't hear the

332
0:30:20.180 --> 0:30:24.760
room because it's a two wire problem. It's not just sound from the remote coming into

333
0:30:24.760 --> 0:30:29.760
the room, it's sound from the room going out to the remotes as well. So we had to have

334
0:30:29.760 --> 0:30:34.040
the sound correctly plugged into BVB. The streaming guys thought they were just plugging

335
0:30:34.040 --> 0:30:38.360
the sound into the streaming. So if you watched the live stream it had the correct sound but

336
0:30:38.360 --> 0:30:42.560
if you were on the BVB thing it was completely silent because they hadn't plugged the sound

337
0:30:42.560 --> 0:30:48.380
in. It's just yet another screw up that we didn't actually think to test out. So this

338
0:30:48.380 --> 0:30:54.360
is how it looks in the sort of conference hall as we were going around it. So this is

339
0:30:54.360 --> 0:31:00.600
the panel you can see. This is what BVB looks like pretty much in a classroom situation.

340
0:31:00.600 --> 0:31:06.560
This is the presentation which you can actually minimize if you click this button but obviously

341
0:31:06.560 --> 0:31:10.800
we thought that the AV people might be able to click the minimize button when the conversation

342
0:31:10.800 --> 0:31:14.780
is going on and then click it back again. No, it didn't really work. They didn't really

343
0:31:14.780 --> 0:31:19.740
want to do this. So we just kept everything up. This is the attendees panel which is all

344
0:31:19.740 --> 0:31:24.360
scrolling which is nice but if you think about it that's not really what you want to see

345
0:31:24.360 --> 0:31:30.280
in the conference. The chat panel if you click this will pop out and come here and this,

346
0:31:30.280 --> 0:31:34.340
the rest of this will really shrink which is also not really what the attendees did.

347
0:31:34.340 --> 0:31:38.080
So what we should have done is have the chat panel down here and get rid of the attendee

348
0:31:38.080 --> 0:31:43.720
list or make it pop out only. So we put this on our to-do list for next time because it's

349
0:31:43.720 --> 0:31:48.740
sort of nice to have but it wasn't essential to getting the conference working. This is

350
0:31:48.740 --> 0:31:54.240
actually an excerpt from the RISC-V micro conference. So Atish Patra is actually asking

351
0:31:54.240 --> 0:31:59.320
a remote question. You can see that he's asking it of a member of the audience so we've switched

352
0:31:59.320 --> 0:32:03.080
to the audience camera view because ideally there would have been two cameras here, one

353
0:32:03.080 --> 0:32:06.520
of the audience, one of the speaker and he could have switched between them but we screwed

354
0:32:06.520 --> 0:32:14.360
up and didn't get that working in time. The tab also includes shared notes which goes

355
0:32:14.360 --> 0:32:21.400
to a back end on ether pads so the remote audience can also see the shared notes and

356
0:32:21.400 --> 0:32:27.200
they can also click on the pop up and these buttons here actually allow you to mute people

357
0:32:27.200 --> 0:32:32.120
who are not supposed to be speaking when they are because in a remote conference you get

358
0:32:32.120 --> 0:32:36.300
lots of people who forget to meet their microphone and then have a conversation with their wife

359
0:32:36.300 --> 0:32:42.600
or their, you know, their significant other. This happens quite often. The way BBB is set

360
0:32:42.600 --> 0:32:47.760
up is that anybody can meet anybody but we thought that might be a bad idea because it's

361
0:32:47.760 --> 0:32:52.080
sort of, you know, cantankerous kernel developers, you never quite know who they'll mute. And

362
0:32:52.080 --> 0:32:56.560
once you've muted somebody you can't unmute them, they can only unmute themselves because

363
0:32:56.560 --> 0:32:59.920
this is a sort of, you know, you can't be unmuting people while they're going to the

364
0:32:59.920 --> 0:33:05.320
bathroom or something, it wouldn't be good on a conference. And we figured this might

365
0:33:05.320 --> 0:33:12.160
be a problem so we'd restricted this functionality to administrators only and then nobody could

366
0:33:12.160 --> 0:33:17.940
figure out who the administrators were so it became a bit of a problem. The video overlays

367
0:33:17.940 --> 0:33:25.120
work quite well so, I mean, this is pretty much a blow up of a 1080p thing and you can

368
0:33:25.120 --> 0:33:29.840
see the Greeking happening in the room. It's very difficult to make out individual attendees

369
0:33:29.840 --> 0:33:36.640
but the sort of remote participants were reasonably visible to most people. So BBB, and especially

370
0:33:36.640 --> 0:33:42.000
you can actually see the way it works with the video muting idea, it's really all you

371
0:33:42.000 --> 0:33:46.540
see are the people participating. Now one of the other things that we'd actually try

372
0:33:46.540 --> 0:33:53.280
to do in the room is the back face, the camera at the back, the camera at the front facing

373
0:33:53.280 --> 0:33:59.400
the back actually had a pan and zoom facility which the AV operators that assured us would

374
0:33:59.400 --> 0:34:04.960
allow them to zoom in on whoever was speaking but in the event what we discovered is that

375
0:34:04.960 --> 0:34:10.480
only two of the AV operators out of our six rooms knew how to use this. So we did get

376
0:34:10.480 --> 0:34:14.320
panning and zooming in some of the rooms but not in all of them. Again, this goes back

377
0:34:14.320 --> 0:34:25.280
to preparation and training. We will do better next time. Yep. And it actually took us quite

378
0:34:25.280 --> 0:34:30.520
a while to get the audio routing right. You'd think that plugging two wires into an AV system

379
0:34:30.520 --> 0:34:37.040
wouldn't be that difficult but in fact it really was. And we finally figured out that

380
0:34:37.040 --> 0:34:43.120
what you had to say to the audio guy is here's a wire from what's effectively a microphone

381
0:34:43.120 --> 0:34:47.880
on the computer. The video guy will give it to you. You just plug it into your fader panel

382
0:34:47.880 --> 0:34:54.040
and remember you have it and you give him a wire for the AV stream that also has to

383
0:34:54.040 --> 0:35:02.480
go into the BBB thing. And eventually we got that to work. But obviously we had other problems.

384
0:35:02.480 --> 0:35:07.000
One of the other things that we'd really thought about was when we get into the room we'd actually

385
0:35:07.000 --> 0:35:11.760
like to have the chat and all the remote attendees on one monitor and then we'd like to have

386
0:35:11.760 --> 0:35:16.680
the presentations on another. So we thought we'll have a two projector set up which sounds

387
0:35:16.680 --> 0:35:22.800
fine until you realize that we have rooms about as big as this and the two projectors

388
0:35:22.800 --> 0:35:28.960
were right over there and right over there. So somebody sitting over there can't see what's

389
0:35:28.960 --> 0:35:33.640
on that projector. Somebody sitting over there can't see what's on that projector. So the

390
0:35:33.640 --> 0:35:38.440
only way we could make it work was to display the same image on both projectors which meant

391
0:35:38.440 --> 0:35:42.240
that two projectors was a complete waste of money and we should have gone for a single

392
0:35:42.240 --> 0:35:47.440
central one as well. So next year we will either try with one or three just to see if

393
0:35:47.440 --> 0:35:55.920
we can actually get this right. Obviously as I said the two camera handling we thought

394
0:35:55.920 --> 0:36:00.920
would be the centerpiece of the technology. The reason why we'd upgraded BBB and caused

395
0:36:00.920 --> 0:36:05.880
all of the React JScript failures on the matrix back end was to get this facility that we

396
0:36:05.880 --> 0:36:10.680
couldn't actually use. So that was not only sleepless nights for one person for a week

397
0:36:10.680 --> 0:36:15.240
to try and get it all to work but complete screw up on the day when everything we thought

398
0:36:15.240 --> 0:36:26.680
we'd bought with that upgrade didn't function. The other problem we had was because the AV

399
0:36:26.680 --> 0:36:31.120
people are actually doing the live streaming and because of the way BBB works there is

400
0:36:31.120 --> 0:36:39.320
no choice other than to actually run the master BBB session that is showing up on both projectors

401
0:36:39.320 --> 0:36:46.400
on their AVmux console. And I had thought this might be a problem as well. So BBB is

402
0:36:46.400 --> 0:36:54.520
very heavily matrix, it's very heavily React JavaScript based and certain browsers handle

403
0:36:54.520 --> 0:36:59.600
it better than other browsers. So it's mostly, it works with Firefox quite well now but it

404
0:36:59.600 --> 0:37:04.560
is mostly optimized for Chromium. So I'd actually already asked them God if we have to do this

405
0:37:04.560 --> 0:37:09.520
what is the built in browser of this TMUX thing and they said oh it's Chrome and I thought

406
0:37:09.520 --> 0:37:18.960
oh God it's going to work. But the problem was that the MUX platform might have used

407
0:37:18.960 --> 0:37:23.760
Chromium as an internal thing but Chromium is open source. So the guys who built the

408
0:37:23.760 --> 0:37:28.680
MUX platform had just basically taken WebKit, gutted some of the JavaScripts and hoped that

409
0:37:28.680 --> 0:37:33.360
that would be okay. And what it really meant was the threading functions of JavaScript

410
0:37:33.360 --> 0:37:38.720
didn't work very well. The result was that it kept dropping out of the conference and

411
0:37:38.720 --> 0:37:45.360
obviously since this is running the AV conference when it drops out the in room chat and the

412
0:37:45.360 --> 0:37:50.400
remote participants fully separate. And the problem is there's no indication that this

413
0:37:50.400 --> 0:37:54.680
has happened from the console unless you happen to be watching very carefully because all

414
0:37:54.680 --> 0:37:59.560
you see is that a microphone disappears from that little icon in the top left that says

415
0:37:59.560 --> 0:38:04.280
hey you're the room and suddenly your microphone's gone. That's the only indication the AV people

416
0:38:04.280 --> 0:38:09.240
had they dropped out. Trying to train them to notice this and reconnect was a bit of

417
0:38:09.240 --> 0:38:15.480
a problem. So we do have automated reconnections on the back end but we will try and integrate

418
0:38:15.480 --> 0:38:20.240
into BVV but when we raised it on the list they looked at us and said well how come you

419
0:38:20.240 --> 0:38:25.520
have this problem because nobody else has this problem. If BVV kept on dropping people

420
0:38:25.520 --> 0:38:30.520
out of the conversation as a matter of course people would have complained. This was a specific

421
0:38:30.520 --> 0:38:36.600
interaction due to the cut down browser and the tmux interface that nobody had anticipated.

422
0:38:36.600 --> 0:38:43.440
Again another screw up from not actually trying it beforehand. So as I said rejoin was manual

423
0:38:43.440 --> 0:38:47.960
assuming the AV guy noticed. One of the good things we did have was in room shepherds who

424
0:38:47.960 --> 0:38:53.840
were committee members so they could actually watch the on screen panel every time the icon

425
0:38:53.840 --> 0:38:57.960
disappeared I could I or one of the other shepherds could run to the back of the room

426
0:38:57.960 --> 0:39:02.640
and pat the AV guy on the shoulder and say you need to rejoin please do this. So we could

427
0:39:02.640 --> 0:39:10.680
make it work with a lot of manual fussing behind the scenes but it wasn't easy. So one

428
0:39:10.680 --> 0:39:17.040
of the other things that we realized is that you know hindsight is 20-20. I mean they might

429
0:39:17.040 --> 0:39:21.080
want to run it from the AV console but they don't have to run the whole thing. What we

430
0:39:21.080 --> 0:39:26.040
could have done is have a separate laptop that actually ran all of the AV connections

431
0:39:26.040 --> 0:39:29.840
under the charge of I won't say somebody competent because it would have been one of me the

432
0:39:29.840 --> 0:39:34.080
kernel developers or somebody but somebody who would pay more attention and then what

433
0:39:34.080 --> 0:39:38.320
we could have done for the vmux guys was to actually give them a VNC session or something

434
0:39:38.320 --> 0:39:45.200
like that into the panels they were projecting over the streaming and everything else and

435
0:39:45.200 --> 0:39:49.240
that way we would have had much more control in the room and we'd have been running a full

436
0:39:49.240 --> 0:39:53.560
fledged browser that wouldn't have had most of the connection problems that we had. But

437
0:39:53.560 --> 0:39:59.080
obviously trying to sort that out on the day was pretty much impossible. Particularly unfortunately

438
0:39:59.080 --> 0:40:05.400
is this AV mux platform is sort of Windows based and Windows does not do VNC very well

439
0:40:05.400 --> 0:40:09.820
and trying to get it to work with RDSP which is the Windows native thing didn't work very

440
0:40:09.820 --> 0:40:15.440
well and we just it was we were in Dublin we didn't have any equipment we had to organize

441
0:40:15.440 --> 0:40:20.360
the parties and deal with online conferences we just couldn't get it to work. So we do

442
0:40:20.360 --> 0:40:27.920
know that for the future we are going to try and do a shareable console. And I need to

443
0:40:27.920 --> 0:40:33.960
leave time for questions I have 10 minutes left. We had a load of other problems as well

444
0:40:33.960 --> 0:40:41.640
as you can see this so I'm in order to try and tell you all the difficulty about doing

445
0:40:41.640 --> 0:40:47.160
this I'm talking up the problems. From the audience's point of view this conference was

446
0:40:47.160 --> 0:40:52.200
actually very successful. We got plaudits from most of the attendees that the interaction

447
0:40:52.200 --> 0:40:57.080
worked as they expected they could have their one on one conversations including between

448
0:40:57.080 --> 0:41:01.880
remote and local people, remote and remote people. So everything appeared to just work

449
0:41:01.880 --> 0:41:06.120
for them modulo you know the problems of not being able to hear the room and having to

450
0:41:06.120 --> 0:41:10.760
rejoin and having to tell people the lost AV and they need to rejoin. They forgave us

451
0:41:10.760 --> 0:41:15.720
for all of that so it was actually highly rated as an incredibly successful conference

452
0:41:15.720 --> 0:41:20.000
but it was a bit like a swan with that you know serene sort of thing swimming over the

453
0:41:20.000 --> 0:41:24.600
surface and a load of committee members frantically paddling underneath to try and get all of

454
0:41:24.600 --> 0:41:32.080
this to stay up and running. Our other big screw up was that we had a committee of 10

455
0:41:32.080 --> 0:41:37.240
people but because this was pandemic not all of the committee could turn up in Dublin and

456
0:41:37.240 --> 0:41:43.000
by the time we got to Dublin we only had two local people who actually understood the system

457
0:41:43.000 --> 0:41:46.720
and could deal with it. Surprisingly enough they're the two people who are actually standing

458
0:41:46.720 --> 0:41:52.760
up on the platform now taking the blame for all of this. But believe me in a conference

459
0:41:52.760 --> 0:41:59.120
with six tracks and AV guys who don't know what they're doing if you want a lot of exercise

460
0:41:59.120 --> 0:42:04.880
please do it with two people but if you want to actually make it work seamlessly and vaguely

461
0:42:04.880 --> 0:42:10.200
competently you need one person who understands the setup in each room. So next time we will

462
0:42:10.200 --> 0:42:15.240
try and do it with a minimum number of people as we have same number of track rooms. Again

463
0:42:15.240 --> 0:42:19.440
it's not rocket science it's perhaps something we should have seen ahead of time but we thought

464
0:42:19.440 --> 0:42:28.360
it would be easy and it wasn't. So to leave a bit of time for questions if you have them.

465
0:42:28.360 --> 0:42:34.120
Running conferences is actually hard so just remember that when you go home from here and

466
0:42:34.120 --> 0:42:38.360
volunteering for a conference is actually an act of public self sacrifice that more

467
0:42:38.360 --> 0:42:44.760
of you should consider because honestly you will find out that it is really hard. Running

468
0:42:44.760 --> 0:42:49.440
online conferences is harder especially if you try and do it yourselves because there

469
0:42:49.440 --> 0:42:54.000
is actually a lot more to do. It is actually more difficult to run an online conference

470
0:42:54.000 --> 0:43:00.760
than it is to run an in-person conference paradoxically. And this is mainly to do with

471
0:43:00.760 --> 0:43:04.920
the integration issues. Everything that doesn't integrate well is either your fault or you

472
0:43:04.920 --> 0:43:10.120
are responsible for integrating it and integrating web stuff even in this magic day and age of

473
0:43:10.120 --> 0:43:14.680
sort of you know web scripting and operators and everything else really doesn't work that

474
0:43:14.680 --> 0:43:21.800
well. And hybrid is really only for masochists. Only do a hybrid conference if you want to

475
0:43:21.800 --> 0:43:26.120
give yourself an untold amount of pain that you can then come and complain to an audience

476
0:43:26.120 --> 0:43:33.520
like you about later. But if you really want to get it right the key is training your AV

477
0:43:33.520 --> 0:43:38.840
people. Do not wait like we did to turn up on the day and say it will be easy. You need

478
0:43:38.840 --> 0:43:43.080
a couple of training sessions a few months beforehand to try and get all of the kinks

479
0:43:43.080 --> 0:43:49.800
sorted out. And having meetings and discussing it doesn't cut it. You need the AV people

480
0:43:49.800 --> 0:43:55.840
to set it all up and preferably have a few people fly out to see the set up, work with

481
0:43:55.840 --> 0:44:02.440
a few remote people so you actually check it out in all of its situations. And obviously

482
0:44:02.440 --> 0:44:06.160
you need to do this in advance. You don't do it on the day of the conference which is

483
0:44:06.160 --> 0:44:13.840
what we try to do. Oh well lesson learned. So with that I think I have about five minutes

484
0:44:13.840 --> 0:44:19.080
for questions. This was actually all done in open source using HTML and CSS. That does

485
0:44:19.080 --> 0:44:24.920
make me a web developer. Proud of it now finally. Obviously you can see that kernel developers

486
0:44:24.920 --> 0:44:30.080
don't quite do web as well as web developers. So if any web developers would like to join

487
0:44:30.080 --> 0:44:35.840
our program committee and become jointly responsible for next year's disaster please come forward.

488
0:44:35.840 --> 0:44:40.720
The presentation is all online and I've also put it up on the link in Pentabath so you

489
0:44:40.720 --> 0:44:44.720
should just be able to click on it. All of the links in the presentation that are highlighted

490
0:44:44.720 --> 0:44:49.280
are clickable if you want to see the URLs. And with that I'll just say thank you and

491
0:44:49.280 --> 0:45:01.080
Mike and I can now answer questions. Oops. You have Mike. Okay we'll share this mic.

492
0:45:01.080 --> 0:45:20.520
Any questions? Please speak loudly into the microphone. Yes. Thank you. From what you

493
0:45:20.520 --> 0:45:26.760
said about the AV set ups in the hotels were there any discussion to just ask hotels to

494
0:45:26.760 --> 0:45:31.640
you know move their stuff and have your own stuff brought in because to me that seems

495
0:45:31.640 --> 0:45:36.800
after your talk to have been an easier solution to just say you know your AV guys and your

496
0:45:36.800 --> 0:45:41.040
AV is probably good but we have really specialized needs could we just bring our own equipment

497
0:45:41.040 --> 0:45:47.840
in? Okay so the question is could we bring our own equipment in? And the answer is pretty

498
0:45:47.840 --> 0:45:53.920
much every hotel no. Because remember they do the AV routing as a very specialized sort

499
0:45:53.920 --> 0:45:59.000
of adaption for the conference rooms. They have a lot of really expensive speakers sometimes

500
0:45:59.000 --> 0:46:04.120
in the ceiling sometimes at the back of the room and they don't want any non-experts touching

501
0:46:04.120 --> 0:46:09.680
it. So what hotels usually have as a clause in their contract is a requirement that you

502
0:46:09.680 --> 0:46:14.720
use their own sound guys and this clause is non-negotiable. We did try and negotiate with

503
0:46:14.720 --> 0:46:19.320
a couple of hotels where we said because we had a few screw ups even in the live streaming

504
0:46:19.320 --> 0:46:23.800
days where the hotel didn't do very well and we thought we could do better. But it's always

505
0:46:23.800 --> 0:46:29.400
come back to us as an absolute no. It's actually very lucky for the ULB guys who are used to

506
0:46:29.400 --> 0:46:33.480
having students handle their equipment and don't seem to have as many hang ups about

507
0:46:33.480 --> 0:46:38.840
it as hotels. So there are people here who can be trained on this equipment who can use

508
0:46:38.840 --> 0:46:44.400
it but pretty much when you're running a conference in a hotel or in a professional conference

509
0:46:44.400 --> 0:46:48.760
hall that we've also been to so community convention center or something you actually

510
0:46:48.760 --> 0:46:53.320
have to use their AV staff you don't get a choice. And that means that you always have

511
0:46:53.320 --> 0:46:57.920
this extra component of people that you have to deal with and they're usually people who

512
0:46:57.920 --> 0:47:02.560
don't really understand fully what your requirements are because it's very difficult to communicate

513
0:47:02.560 --> 0:47:07.040
ahead of time. And these people are usually the people that you don't get to talk to until

514
0:47:07.040 --> 0:47:12.080
you turn up at the conference. So when you have your intermediate AV guys like we had

515
0:47:12.080 --> 0:47:16.760
and you have your meeting with them you always have to make sure that they have enough knowledge

516
0:47:16.760 --> 0:47:20.320
and insight that they can do the knowledge transfer to the sound guys who are going to

517
0:47:20.320 --> 0:47:26.360
be coming in on the day from the hotel. So yeah it's a huge problem and there's almost

518
0:47:26.360 --> 0:47:31.160
nothing you can do to get out of it besides sort of having a very friendly university

519
0:47:31.160 --> 0:47:35.160
who will let you play with their equipment because pretty much nobody in the professional

520
0:47:35.160 --> 0:47:42.640
circuit will let you play with their equipment. I have one question from the chat. Was it

521
0:47:42.640 --> 0:47:50.080
worth it to record the audience? So the question was was it worth it to record the audience?

522
0:47:50.080 --> 0:47:55.320
And the answer to that is actually very much yes because remember in a micro conference

523
0:47:55.320 --> 0:48:00.000
we're stimulating discussions between arbitrary groups of people. So these would be people

524
0:48:00.000 --> 0:48:05.520
who are sitting in the audience physically versus people who are sort of remote. And

525
0:48:05.520 --> 0:48:10.120
in order to have a correct two-way conversation you actually have to be able to see the person

526
0:48:10.120 --> 0:48:14.960
on the other end. And so the whole point of the audience camera, at least when it worked

527
0:48:14.960 --> 0:48:19.560
with the panning and zooming, was that if you were having a remote to local conversation

528
0:48:19.560 --> 0:48:24.680
with the audience the remote people could actually see the local participant. And if

529
0:48:24.680 --> 0:48:30.040
we only had a camera facing the speaker we'd either have to call every participant up to

530
0:48:30.040 --> 0:48:36.240
stand on the stage which wastes time or we'd just have to not have them be able to see

531
0:48:36.240 --> 0:48:40.560
the person they're talking to. And being able to see the person you're talking to is very

532
0:48:40.560 --> 0:48:44.920
important for interactions. There are lots of visual cues that people get wrong. So I

533
0:48:44.920 --> 0:48:52.160
think having an audience camera is actually one of the good benefits of, or at least one

534
0:48:52.160 --> 0:48:56.200
of the benefits the plumbers did and one of the good insights we had to try and get an

535
0:48:56.200 --> 0:49:02.640
interactive conference running. So I wouldn't go back and do no audience camera, no.

536
0:49:02.640 --> 0:49:10.360
Just wanted to get back to what you said about the ULB being willing to allow us to use their

537
0:49:10.360 --> 0:49:13.960
audio equipment. I just want to point out that this has a lot to do with the fact that

538
0:49:13.960 --> 0:49:19.600
we've been doing this for 20 years and they know us. It wasn't always the case and if

539
0:49:19.600 --> 0:49:26.080
you're not false them or you're not working with the ULB this probably isn't the case.

540
0:49:26.080 --> 0:49:32.640
So could you repeat the, I got half the question, no. Yeah it wasn't the question really so

541
0:49:32.640 --> 0:49:38.080
much as to point out that us being allowed to touch the audio equipment here by the ULB

542
0:49:38.080 --> 0:49:41.280
has a lot to do with the fact that we've been doing this for 20 years and they know us.

543
0:49:41.280 --> 0:49:45.840
Okay so the point being made is that ULB only allows the staff here to touch the equipment

544
0:49:45.840 --> 0:49:49.640
because they've been doing it a long time and they've built up trust. The way we work

545
0:49:49.640 --> 0:49:54.960
we tend to go to a different hotel every time we hold plumbers in a different location.

546
0:49:54.960 --> 0:50:01.520
So pretty much even if we could get a trust to build up with a hotel chain we just, we

547
0:50:01.520 --> 0:50:06.880
wouldn't be in the hotel often enough to do it. But the important point to emphasize is

548
0:50:06.880 --> 0:50:13.120
that pretty much 95% of the time you will be forced to work with AV people who are supplied

549
0:50:13.120 --> 0:50:28.640
to you by whoever owns the equipment. You won't get a choice of who does it. Okay. Is

550
0:50:28.640 --> 0:50:40.800
that it? Okay. Well thank you very much indeed.
