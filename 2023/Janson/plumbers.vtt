WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
So, it's been a while since I've been in FOSDAM and one of the things that I, well I usually

00:13.240 --> 00:19.360
talk about technical topics but this is really me talking about sort of using open source

00:19.360 --> 00:25.200
instead of producing it which is quite an unusual position for me to be in.

00:25.200 --> 00:33.080
I work most often in things like the Linux kernel, I also work in open source politics

00:33.080 --> 00:38.000
so I did a lot of kernel interaction with the Linux Foundation and one of those pieces

00:38.000 --> 00:43.080
of interaction was actually being a founding member of Linux Plumbers Conference which

00:43.080 --> 00:50.080
is the conference we'll actually be talking about for this presentation.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.840
Plumbers was basically founded in 2008 as an in-person conference and it's always been

00:54.840 --> 00:59.080
an in-person conference up to the pandemic years.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.880
It's actually organized somewhat similarly to FOSDAM in that it has tracks and what are

01:03.880 --> 01:05.780
called micro conferences.

01:05.780 --> 01:10.400
The micro conferences are similar to dev rooms except they're really a bit more interactive

01:10.400 --> 01:14.840
so they're really expected to do participant conversations and usually you get a cluster

01:14.840 --> 01:20.600
of people at the front talking to each other.

01:20.600 --> 01:25.960
The tracks themselves when we have them mostly tend to be presentations so very like this

01:25.960 --> 01:31.320
but the micro conferences tend to be very discussion based so if you think about trying

01:31.320 --> 01:36.080
to do that sort of hybrid and online you realize you need some sort of highly interactive video

01:36.080 --> 01:39.440
system which is what we went through.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.200
One of the good things we had for Plumbers is that the conference actually produces quite

01:44.200 --> 01:45.500
a lot of money.

01:45.500 --> 01:52.520
We have quite a lot of sponsorship so it's quite easy to pay people to do things in the

01:52.520 --> 01:57.200
conference and one of the things we paid for in 2018 was to actually make the conference

01:57.200 --> 02:02.320
live streaming for all of those who couldn't attend and also to try and put all of the

02:02.320 --> 02:08.040
videos of every presentation and every discussion we had up on the website and obviously to

02:08.040 --> 02:14.000
do that we needed to pay somebody to run AV in each of our rooms and Plumbers tends to

02:14.000 --> 02:21.520
run us about somewhere between four and eight simultaneous tracks so we needed about 16

02:21.520 --> 02:25.760
cameras to do this and about between four and eight people to stay in the room to also

02:25.760 --> 02:29.760
do it.

02:29.760 --> 02:34.200
And obviously this then included provision of cameras in the rooms and the way we set

02:34.200 --> 02:39.440
up cameras at Plumbers is slightly different from what you have here because in your setup

02:39.440 --> 02:44.360
the camera is mostly looking down at me because you think I should be the focus of attention

02:44.360 --> 02:50.000
which is true because I'm giving the talk but when you're actually trying to record

02:50.000 --> 02:55.680
an ongoing live discussion that mostly happens between people in the audience you also need

02:55.680 --> 02:58.120
the people who are live streaming to be able to see it.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.760
So one of the other fortuitous things is Plumbers is always set up with two cameras, one at

03:02.760 --> 03:07.840
the back looking down on the speaker and then one at the front looking out at the audience

03:07.840 --> 03:12.240
and the AV guys are actually responsible for switching between the front view and the back

03:12.240 --> 03:17.120
view so that when we start to get conversations within the audience the camera can actually

03:17.120 --> 03:19.840
catch them and you can watch it.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.160
And this actually turned out to be really fortuitous as well.

03:24.160 --> 03:29.080
Obviously when you try and record your conference the first thing you realize is that in a highly

03:29.080 --> 03:34.560
interactive conference most people don't use the microphone and it's really annoying for

03:34.560 --> 03:38.920
everybody on the streaming when you get a load of silence in the room.

03:38.920 --> 03:43.720
So persuading people to use microphones is one of the key things that you have to do

03:43.720 --> 03:47.280
when you start recording your conference and this is still nothing to do with trying to

03:47.280 --> 03:52.720
get it live or hybrid, this is just recording the conference.

03:52.720 --> 03:58.040
So you have to persuade all participants in the conversation to actually use a microphone

03:58.040 --> 04:03.280
and however much money your conference makes you will only have a few microphones like

04:03.280 --> 04:08.080
this one we have two microphones at the front, I have one lavalier microphone for a room

04:08.080 --> 04:11.320
that could possibly seat over a thousand people.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.760
Trying to run around with microphones when you're doing an interactive conversation is

04:14.760 --> 04:18.600
really difficult as I assume the guys with the orange t-shirts will be able to tell you

04:18.600 --> 04:21.740
over a beer after the event.

04:21.740 --> 04:27.000
The solution we took was borrowed from another conference in Paris called Kernel Recipes

04:27.000 --> 04:33.200
which are these things called catch boxes and effectively they're square plastic polystyrene

04:33.200 --> 04:38.080
blobs that have a microphone inside that you can throw from one end of a conference room

04:38.080 --> 04:42.640
to another and this gives you a way of actually getting the microphone between the participants

04:42.640 --> 04:50.660
very fast and it's definitely fun to use and they do encourage participation.

04:50.660 --> 04:56.240
So far we've had no injuries, I should actually qualify, we've actually had no serious injuries

04:56.240 --> 05:00.360
so far with people throwing microphones at each other but I assume there's always a first

05:00.360 --> 05:04.000
time.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
And the idea was really to try and make the conference that we were running available

05:09.000 --> 05:13.920
in real time to people who can't participate because you know it's a kernel development

05:13.920 --> 05:18.440
conference we get people who want to come from all over the globe and we always have

05:18.440 --> 05:22.560
corners of the globe especially when we run the conference in America that even if they

05:22.560 --> 05:26.240
have the best will in the world and they can actually scrape up the money to come they're

05:26.240 --> 05:33.560
often denied visas by the US authorities so it can be a real really difficult problem.

05:33.560 --> 05:38.880
And for our first attempts at doing this the communication was really only outbound so

05:38.880 --> 05:42.640
the remote participants could watch what was going on in the room but they couldn't really

05:42.640 --> 05:45.800
participate.

05:45.800 --> 05:53.240
And obviously this all changed in 2000 when we got to the pandemic years.

05:53.240 --> 05:57.400
Like all other conferences plumbers moved to being fully online.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.000
We didn't, we were actually in the year 2000 we already booked a venue up in Halifax Nova

06:02.000 --> 06:07.240
Scotia, we had a huge amount of fun trying to get out of that venue contract when it

06:07.240 --> 06:11.360
emerged that we couldn't actually hold the conference up there and then we all had to

06:11.360 --> 06:14.660
scramble to try and actually do this fully online.

06:14.660 --> 06:20.120
So this is where the story becomes quite interesting because there are ten people on plumbers committee

06:20.120 --> 06:27.800
Mike Rappaport over here is one of them because of the origin we are primarily kernel developers

06:27.800 --> 06:32.600
and because we're moving fully online effectively kernel developers are becoming responsible

06:32.600 --> 06:37.600
for web programming because what we're really doing is setting up a distributed set of web

06:37.600 --> 06:45.040
services and if you know kernel developers we mostly tend to theoretically look down

06:45.040 --> 06:49.240
on web developers because obviously the kernel development is at the hard core of everything

06:49.240 --> 06:56.560
so this is somewhat a story of how a bunch of kernel developers tried to do web and failed

06:56.560 --> 07:05.320
a bit, screwed up quite a lot and eventually got it working by the seat of their pants.

07:05.320 --> 07:10.760
We evaluated a load of options for actually going fully online as every conference did,

07:10.760 --> 07:16.840
they scrambled to, we discussed it a lot with other conferences, people had different ideas,

07:16.840 --> 07:21.720
we were actually under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation and they're a much more commercial

07:21.720 --> 07:27.360
entity than we are, we're still volunteer run even pulling a lot of money, their idea

07:27.360 --> 07:33.080
was just to pay somebody to do the solutions and frankly in the early days that looked

07:33.080 --> 07:37.040
like a good idea to us, if you can just pay money to get rid of the problem why wouldn't

07:37.040 --> 07:44.440
you and we have enough money, we've got almost a million dollars in the bank now for plumbers,

07:44.440 --> 07:48.520
we could afford to spend a lot of that money to actually pay for somebody to sort out these

07:48.520 --> 07:53.320
problems and the Linux Foundation tried to do it for several conferences and we looked

07:53.320 --> 07:58.420
at their solution and went you know this is terrible, I mean why is it so difficult and

07:58.420 --> 08:05.560
so bad trying to run a conference and so the only way we could actually foresee getting

08:05.560 --> 08:11.040
this working is if we just abandoned all of the commercial solutions and did it ourselves

08:11.040 --> 08:18.240
which is much more difficult than we imagined to actually do but the goal of this was that

08:18.240 --> 08:24.120
we definitely needed in our online conference to have two way video interaction in real

08:24.120 --> 08:29.160
time between the participants, that was the goal and there was no real conference system

08:29.160 --> 08:34.520
that did that, if you've tried holding conferences over zoom you can just about do it but things

08:34.520 --> 08:41.360
like BBB actually do an awful lot better than this and the other thing we discovered is

08:41.360 --> 08:47.640
that when you're running a collection of web services it really is all about the integrations.

08:47.640 --> 08:52.920
Open source gives you a lot of excellent pieces so we use big blue button, we use indico for

08:52.920 --> 08:57.400
the conference scheduling, eventually we use matrix for the track, we didn't use it in

08:57.400 --> 09:03.000
the first year but there's also a downside to that, whenever you try and integrate web

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
services you always write a set of glue around them that needs to be maintained and if there

09:10.000 --> 09:13.920
are a load of disparate services that aren't used to talking to each other it does the

09:13.920 --> 09:18.920
impedance matching between the services and as the years go by and remember this is a

09:18.920 --> 09:23.700
conference so we put it on once a year, every year you upgrade to the new versions and suddenly

09:23.700 --> 09:27.800
your glue doesn't work again so it always becomes a maintenance nightmare to get the

09:27.800 --> 09:37.840
glue working. So if you ever came to the plumbers conference the web front end that you first

09:37.840 --> 09:44.360
see if you go to meet.lpc.events is a piece of code that John Corbett wrote in Python

09:44.360 --> 09:51.720
and Django called the Linux plumbers conference front end, LPCFE, oh and I should add that

09:51.720 --> 09:56.840
these things here are clickable URLs so if you go to the presentation and you want to

09:56.840 --> 10:03.840
know where it is you can just hover over it and it will tell you. Obviously green light

10:03.840 --> 10:11.600
is actually the way you log people onto BBB so by replacing green light in big blue button

10:11.600 --> 10:18.180
we've effectively taken on the job ourselves of doing integration, authentication, user

10:18.180 --> 10:24.920
management and pretty much everything else, this is actually a major replacement of services

10:24.920 --> 10:29.640
on big blue button and the reason we did this is because we needed an integration with our

10:29.640 --> 10:34.800
conference timetable, we just wanted the conference timetable to display on the first screen with

10:34.800 --> 10:39.280
a little button that said click here to go to this session, it's very like you have in

10:39.280 --> 10:44.360
FOSDAM with the matrix chat, if you just click on the integration of the matrix chat it brings

10:44.360 --> 10:48.040
up the live stream and you can see what's going on in the conference, we wanted it to

10:48.040 --> 10:54.080
work pretty much as it does here and green light just wouldn't do that for us because

10:54.080 --> 10:58.560
green light was designed to be a teaching front end for a single classroom, it wasn't

10:58.560 --> 11:09.800
really thinking about multiple tracks, multiple track rooms and timetable integration. So

11:09.800 --> 11:16.600
we also, by getting rid of all of the attendee credentials, we actually had to integrate

11:16.600 --> 11:21.800
with some sort of authentication server that could be distributed, so being kernel developers

11:21.800 --> 11:25.920
because we chose LDAT because it's the oldest one and it's the one everybody has the most

11:25.920 --> 11:32.800
trouble with, so we should be able to use it right. The credentials were the email address

11:32.800 --> 11:37.920
that you used to register with the conference which is easy and the password was just the

11:37.920 --> 11:43.200
confirmation number because fortunately the Linux Foundation's CVAN system spits out these

11:43.200 --> 11:47.160
long confirmation numbers and they're all guaranteed to be unique, so that's obviously

11:47.160 --> 11:54.280
really easy. Problem, again, integration. The CVAN system will not speak to anything

11:54.280 --> 12:02.880
outside CVAN, so if you register for the conference and you don't automatically show up in the

12:02.880 --> 12:08.320
LDAP database, what has to happen is I have to go to the CVAN website and export a spreadsheet

12:08.320 --> 12:13.720
of all of the users, figure out which are new ones and then feed the details into the

12:13.720 --> 12:19.080
LDAP server, which, I mean, as an offline activity it sounds really simple. It becomes

12:19.080 --> 12:24.120
really complicated when you keep getting people who don't register until the last minute of

12:24.120 --> 12:29.160
the conference, turn up halfway through a session, want to register and then immediately

12:29.160 --> 12:34.300
be able to see what the hell is going on and they have to wait for, I don't know how long

12:34.300 --> 12:38.280
for somebody to actually put their credentials in the database and when you're running a

12:38.280 --> 12:43.300
conference pretty much all of your attendees are running around, all of your organizers

12:43.300 --> 12:47.720
are running around full time, nobody has time to tend the back end of the database and that

12:47.720 --> 12:55.560
became a bottleneck for certain people. So my request of you is if you ever get into

12:55.560 --> 13:02.520
this situation, register early, please, don't turn up at the last minute, it's much easier.

13:02.520 --> 13:08.500
Then the next problem is that nobody is actually really used to interacting online. I mean,

13:08.500 --> 13:12.560
you think it's easy, you've seen Zoom calls, you all just turn up and you've got, you know,

13:12.560 --> 13:16.880
pieces of each other on it. If you try and do that with 800 people, Zoom doesn't really

13:16.880 --> 13:23.960
do auto focus very well. You can't see who's talking and if you're just observing the conference

13:23.960 --> 13:31.200
it just becomes a mass of faces and it's completely useless. So we obviously have standard issues

13:31.200 --> 13:36.880
like good webcam, good microphone. The number of people probably among you sitting in this

13:36.880 --> 13:41.800
room who think that the standard set of speakers on your Dell system when you just open the

13:41.800 --> 13:46.840
laptop will do when you're chatting to each other, believe me it won't. The thing that

13:46.840 --> 13:53.360
audiences hate the most in online conferences is static, background noise, indistinctness,

13:53.360 --> 13:57.760
being unable to get the point across. If you don't have in the attendees who are going

13:57.760 --> 14:03.440
to interact good AV equipment, this is the thing which actually makes the conference

14:03.440 --> 14:09.400
experience go down the fastest. This is about the only thing we got right because we gave

14:09.400 --> 14:14.200
us speaker gifts designed to be delivered to anywhere in the world a month before the

14:14.200 --> 14:20.760
conference, a complete gift pack of headset lights so you could actually see the face

14:20.760 --> 14:25.440
and a webcam you could put on the top of your camera, a 1080p webcam so we were sure that

14:25.440 --> 14:30.200
we'd actually have a good view of the speakers. We made sure that they got to all of our nearly

14:30.200 --> 14:35.240
100 speakers in the conference and most of them didn't use them which was a bit of a

14:35.240 --> 14:41.600
problem. We also found as I've explained with Zoom that raised hands don't work and having

14:41.600 --> 14:46.640
a load of people on video who you have no idea what's going on doesn't work either.

14:46.640 --> 14:51.040
So the thing we pioneered for plumbers is called video muting which is where we try

14:51.040 --> 14:56.520
and instruct the attendees to if you're just watching don't turn your camera on. So pretty

14:56.520 --> 15:00.560
much it's a blank screen. The only people who turn their camera on are people who are

15:00.560 --> 15:04.800
talking or people who are waiting to talk so it actually gives a good visual clue that

15:04.800 --> 15:09.320
somebody wants to interject at this point and we found it was actually a reasonably

15:09.320 --> 15:14.640
good way of facilitating interaction in an online conference and it certainly solves

15:14.640 --> 15:19.920
the Zoom confusion where you just can't figure out who's talking to whom on your screen of

15:19.920 --> 15:24.800
and for the online conference we did have about 900 attendees so you could imagine on

15:24.800 --> 15:33.340
a Zoom screen everybody would probably get about 5 pixels. In 2020, Big Blue Button comes

15:33.340 --> 15:38.400
with an internal chat system which means anybody logged into Big Blue Button can pop out a

15:38.400 --> 15:43.880
chat tab at the side and they'll be able to chat with anybody who's logged into the conference.

15:43.880 --> 15:49.120
So this is why if you were doing streaming of the conference you couldn't interact because

15:49.120 --> 15:55.600
that is a completely enclosed chat system. But we realized that people wanted to have

15:55.600 --> 16:00.420
conversations outside the discussion rooms as well, things like hallway tracks. So we

16:00.420 --> 16:05.560
actually adopted a, it's a sort of open source project called Rocket Chat. Now the core of

16:05.560 --> 16:10.800
the project is fully open sourced but Rocket Chat themselves runs a more open core model

16:10.800 --> 16:14.720
where there are certain enterprise upsells and everything but this was just the one we

16:14.720 --> 16:19.580
came across. And the good thing for us is it doesn't require any integration because

16:19.580 --> 16:24.480
we'd already started to realize the more integrations you do, the more difficulty you have, the

16:24.480 --> 16:30.440
more strings and balen wire stuff there is to go wrong at the crunch time when you put

16:30.440 --> 16:35.480
the conference on. So no integration looked like a good thing until we tried to run the

16:35.480 --> 16:41.080
conference. And then the problems were that chat was hard to read on the live stream because

16:41.080 --> 16:46.240
we're streaming it out pretty much through YouTube. We actually, Guy Lunardi wrote a

16:46.240 --> 16:51.080
streaming module for BVB and we just plugged it in as an additional attendee and what it

16:51.080 --> 16:57.000
saw was what we streamed to YouTube. And the problem is that YouTube does dynamic compression

16:57.000 --> 17:02.200
of most of the stuff while it's streaming and if you have a low bandwidth connection

17:02.200 --> 17:06.480
it will quite happily Greek all of the chat that's going on and you just can't see what

17:06.480 --> 17:13.480
is going on on the chat. Whereas, you know, if it's sort of having a bandwidth problem

17:13.480 --> 17:18.320
with faces and you're just looking at lips moving, you can stand losing quite a few pixels

17:18.320 --> 17:24.880
but if you're trying to follow chat it's just impossible. And obviously streamers didn't

17:24.880 --> 17:28.840
have any credentials to the RocketChat anyway because we based it on our LDAP. If you're

17:28.840 --> 17:32.520
not registered for the conference you have no chat credentials. So they couldn't join

17:32.520 --> 17:37.200
the hallway track either which they didn't like. This was the problem. And the third

17:37.200 --> 17:41.240
problem was we had to buy an enterprise license from RocketChat actually to get some of the

17:41.240 --> 17:48.800
notifications that we used for integration to work. And the two chat systems were completely

17:48.800 --> 17:54.080
and fully disconnected. So you couldn't use your RocketChat login to look at the BBB chat

17:54.080 --> 18:00.320
and vice versa which also was a bit balkanizing and a bit annoying for people. And so you

18:00.320 --> 18:04.440
can see that the thing I initially portrayed as a huge advantage because we didn't have

18:04.440 --> 18:08.920
to worry about the integration was the thing that everybody found the biggest disadvantage

18:08.920 --> 18:14.000
about the conference because it wasn't integrated. So you always get this pressure of, and you

18:14.000 --> 18:18.760
know as conference organizers, the more integration you do the more chance there is that something

18:18.760 --> 18:24.160
will go wrong. But if you don't do enough integration your audience don't like it. So

18:24.160 --> 18:30.520
you have to get the amount of integration right. And for several conferences we actually

18:30.520 --> 18:38.840
struggled to do this. Every registered attendee got a matrix ID and since we used email and

18:38.840 --> 18:45.120
confirmation number to login we figured we just use email address matrix as well. But

18:45.120 --> 18:50.000
there's a slight problem here. Emails contain an at sign. Matrix does not like additional

18:50.000 --> 18:55.280
at signs in your ID so we had to replace the at sign with a full stop which I thought,

18:55.280 --> 18:58.960
oh it could be easy for our attendees. They're all computer geeks. They'll get this. They'll

18:58.960 --> 19:04.200
know email address for one server, email address but with at sign substitutes with dot for

19:04.200 --> 19:10.080
another server. Complete disaster. You know they just couldn't figure out which ID correctly

19:10.080 --> 19:17.280
to use for which. Eventually we got the BBB server to use either form of the address and

19:17.280 --> 19:22.040
we actually got the matrix server to translate using a JavaScript widget. If they typed in

19:22.040 --> 19:25.800
the email address it would just fill in the dot and everything would just work. We tried

19:25.800 --> 19:32.720
it without doing that for a couple of days and got a bucket full of complaints. I should

19:32.720 --> 19:40.640
also add that when we chose Rocket Chat in 2020 I wasn't very happy about the decision

19:40.640 --> 19:46.040
because I was a fledgling matrix user and I was sure that matrix could handle the conference

19:46.040 --> 19:51.200
and I thought it would actually be a good idea to do this. So I'd advocated even in

19:51.200 --> 19:56.680
2020 that we should be using matrix and finally after all the difficulty with Rocket Chat

19:56.680 --> 20:04.880
in 2021 I got my wish. So they told me we're using matrix and you're in charge which was

20:04.880 --> 20:10.080
fun until the first day came along and the matrix server with 900 people on it just fell

20:10.080 --> 20:16.980
over. And we had actually done scaling testing. I mean I'm not naive. I know things can go

20:16.980 --> 20:22.560
wrong at scale that you know you don't see in your own lab. So we'd invited everybody

20:22.560 --> 20:27.760
to come along for a town hall but only 100 people showed up and it turned out that most

20:27.760 --> 20:32.720
of the scaling problems we had were somewhere between 100 and 900. So we hadn't hit any

20:32.720 --> 20:41.800
of them in our little test. And I'd also tried to scale up the matrix server so our massive

20:41.800 --> 20:49.000
16 CPU system that we were paying you know about $100 a month for when you ran top on

20:49.000 --> 20:53.760
it was only using one CPU because I hadn't realized that matrix synapse which was the

20:53.760 --> 21:01.560
server we chose was single threaded. I mean who in 2021 writes a single threaded web application

21:01.560 --> 21:07.340
but the matrix people thread matrix by using the back end web server through a sequence

21:07.340 --> 21:13.320
of proxies to actually do this but that is not the default configuration. And so on the

21:13.320 --> 21:18.120
Monday of the conference I was left there in my own little basement sweating away going

21:18.120 --> 21:22.920
how the hell do I scale this thing. But fortunately several people who attended FOSDEM which did

21:22.920 --> 21:28.760
use matrix before we did also ran into this problem and they were able to send me email

21:28.760 --> 21:34.040
saying yeah we've got this guy you can talk to he'll teach you how to do it. So fortunately

21:34.040 --> 21:40.240
within about four hours of discovering the problem and realizing it didn't scale we had

21:40.240 --> 21:45.400
a roughly scaling matrix server working and I managed to actually complete the scaling

21:45.400 --> 21:51.000
by the end of the first day so for the second day matrix was actually fully functional fortunately

21:51.000 --> 21:56.980
since it was my little baby. And I actually did a little blog post about how we got this

21:56.980 --> 22:01.680
to work just so if anybody else ever runs into the problems there are online resources

22:01.680 --> 22:07.760
to go to to get yourselves out of it. One of the good things about using matrix was

22:07.760 --> 22:13.040
that even the free tier attendees the streaming tier attendees could now actually interact

22:13.040 --> 22:18.800
by chat. So anybody with their own matrix ID could log on to any of our matrix rooms

22:18.800 --> 22:23.280
because they're all public in the same way that all the FOSDEM rooms are public. Every

22:23.280 --> 22:29.520
attendee still got their own separated matrix ID but that you only got logged onto the matrix

22:29.520 --> 22:36.080
ID if you actually popped up the side chat panel. You could also use your own separated

22:36.080 --> 22:42.200
matrix thing and use your own matrix ID as well if you wanted to. And it just depended

22:42.200 --> 22:50.040
how you wanted to interact with the conference. Guilinardi was the one who actually modified

22:50.040 --> 22:56.520
the BVB server to instead of opening its own chat tab we just stole the iframe concept

22:56.520 --> 23:02.480
it uses for the blackboard and we did a riot embedded which is done by some URL to the

23:02.480 --> 23:09.720
GitHub account is there. The integration, the riot embedded is not as good as running

23:09.720 --> 23:15.240
the electron type application but trying to embed an electron application into a web form

23:15.240 --> 23:20.700
is just a nightmare and doesn't work. So it's a very cut down version all it really does

23:20.700 --> 23:27.840
is text pictures and reactions. It doesn't do any of these sort of complicated threading

23:27.840 --> 23:33.000
or replies or anything but that's pretty much good enough for conference attendees. But

23:33.000 --> 23:37.280
you can see the Primrose path we're treading down because this is yet another integration

23:37.280 --> 23:46.120
into matrix, in a BVB in matrix that is not done by either upstream. But it was really

23:46.120 --> 23:55.240
useful so the streamers could see the chat if it was grieved on their streaming screen

23:55.240 --> 24:00.400
they could actually use a matrix client and still view the chat in real time without having

24:00.400 --> 24:07.080
to worry about video compression and reduction. And so we thought after we'd done this successfully

24:07.080 --> 24:12.800
for two years now, especially for one year with rocket chat, one year with matrix, it

24:12.800 --> 24:16.680
wouldn't be too difficult to move over to hybrid which is probably really the point

24:16.680 --> 24:25.800
of this talk. We already had all the remote infrastructure. By the way, to run this style

24:25.800 --> 24:29.240
of remote infrastructure for a conference the size of plumbers so we're talking about

24:29.240 --> 24:35.680
900 people and we assume that for the in person one we'd probably be about 400 in person,

24:35.680 --> 24:41.080
500 online. It will cost you somewhere between three and five thousand dollars to actually

24:41.080 --> 24:46.080
set up and run. It's not cheap to do the hosting of all of this stuff. Especially because we

24:46.080 --> 24:51.560
had to host at scale. We needed one BVB server per each track room. We had about six track

24:51.560 --> 24:56.320
rooms. We had a few spare servers left over for hack rooms and we had one for the hallway

24:56.320 --> 25:05.480
track. But the way we looked at it is we already had all of the AV necessary for actually just

25:05.480 --> 25:09.680
this is the naive thought which is where kernel developers go. You know, we've got AV in the

25:09.680 --> 25:14.320
room, it's got two cameras and it's got a load of microphones. The room is just another

25:14.320 --> 25:19.560
single person attending the BVB chat. It'll be easy to do it like that, the naive way

25:19.560 --> 25:25.520
of thinking. But it really, really is not that simple trying to get a hybrid conference

25:25.520 --> 25:33.240
running. The significant problem is that you have to integrate with in room AV and in room

25:33.240 --> 25:39.800
AV, well, okay, so at ULB you control it. But we were doing it in hotels. Hotels have

25:39.800 --> 25:44.440
their own local AV teams. If you touch a piece of their equipment they tend to go screaming

25:44.440 --> 25:49.840
to management. In order to get the integration done you can't do it yourself as the conference

25:49.840 --> 25:57.140
organizes. The AV people, the audio people have to do it. And it's surprising the number

25:57.140 --> 26:02.120
of audio people who sort of sit behind those switcher boards at the back of conferences

26:02.120 --> 26:07.640
who've never even seen a sort of online hybrid conference and have no idea how to set this

26:07.640 --> 26:13.000
up. So just plonking this sort of video display down in front of them and saying, hey, now

26:13.000 --> 26:18.840
you're in charge of audio and video and we just want the conference to work, wasn't actually

26:18.840 --> 26:26.880
a winning strategy. So we discovered rapidly and unfortunately it was pretty much on the

26:26.880 --> 26:32.400
day of the conference that we had to train the AV people and have to use all of this

26:32.400 --> 26:38.800
stuff. And we were actually quite fortunate because we'd ordered the video based AV. We

26:38.800 --> 26:44.560
actually had two sets of AV people. So the hotel usually supplies audio people to plug

26:44.560 --> 26:49.000
in your projectors and your microphones into the hotel's audio. And then we had a separate

26:49.000 --> 26:54.600
AV company whose job was to manage the cameras and sort of cut the whole thing together and

26:54.600 --> 27:00.360
do the live streaming. So we actually had two AV teams effectively and we were assuming

27:00.360 --> 27:04.880
that we could just co-opt the AV team who was doing the live streaming because live

27:04.880 --> 27:10.040
streaming, running live streaming is not much different than running an online conference,

27:10.040 --> 27:18.040
right? Wrong. So we held meetings beforehand with them and we talked to them about it.

27:18.040 --> 27:22.400
We couldn't hold meetings with the hotel audio guys but we assumed it would just be a plug

27:22.400 --> 27:31.320
for them, which it wasn't. And nobody really anticipated the issues that we actually had.

27:31.320 --> 27:36.520
Specifically the AV setup of remote attendees is not obvious to somebody who's used to dealing

27:36.520 --> 27:41.760
with throwing microphones around a room because there is one extra wire that's coming off

27:41.760 --> 27:47.140
the internet over which a lot of attendee voices can come. And the first time they set

27:47.140 --> 27:53.200
up their AV patch panels, this wire just wasn't plugged in. The second time it was bypassing

27:53.200 --> 27:58.720
all of the audio routing which meant that the sound quality and the volume was chopping

27:58.720 --> 28:04.120
at high strength because it wasn't being attenuated through the usual filters. I mean, this is

28:04.120 --> 28:09.200
the 101, you know, how many screw ups can you have? We basically did them all on the

28:09.200 --> 28:14.200
first day. So let's go through a list of the problems.

28:14.200 --> 28:22.560
Oh, I even forgot to mention that between 2001 and 2002 we decided to upgrade the whole

28:22.560 --> 28:27.720
of the infrastructure. We had specific things in BBB we wanted. Remember I told you we have

28:27.720 --> 28:33.280
two cameras. We have one at the back facing the speaker, one at the front facing the audience.

28:33.280 --> 28:38.040
The new version of BBB could actually handle multiple cameras with different views. So

28:38.040 --> 28:42.680
we figured that wouldn't it be really great if, you know, you want to see the audience

28:42.680 --> 28:46.560
so you just select the audience camera as a remote participant because you want to talk

28:46.560 --> 28:50.600
to them. Or let's say you're a remote speaker, you want to see the audience but the rest

28:50.600 --> 28:54.120
of the people just want to see you. We'll do this multiple camera selection. It was

28:54.120 --> 29:01.140
going to be the cornerstone of our implementation of this. Problem was, nobody told the AV guys.

29:01.140 --> 29:06.000
So the AV guys had come set up with a switcher for the two cameras which is how they ran

29:06.000 --> 29:10.660
the streaming because obviously you can select one camera view or the other because the live

29:10.660 --> 29:16.420
streaming pretty much has one camera view out on it. And by the time we all sat together

29:16.420 --> 29:20.680
in the room there was no way of unplugging this set up and redoing it such that we could

29:20.680 --> 29:25.560
plug in two video cameras because it all has to be done from the AV control deck and they

29:25.560 --> 29:29.940
physically didn't have another input because they were expecting to use a camera switch.

29:29.940 --> 29:35.160
So this is yet another screw up in planning. Third screw up was because we'd upgraded to

29:35.160 --> 29:42.440
the newer BVB. They'd redone the, and this uses Node React as the frame backbone. They'd

29:42.440 --> 29:47.840
redone the way it was working. Riot embedded no longer worked as a Popout panel. We discovered

29:47.840 --> 29:53.120
this fortunately four days before the conference. So this was Guy Lenardi doing a very quick

29:53.120 --> 29:57.600
back end retrofit trying to get the matrix chat that everybody was expecting to work

29:57.600 --> 30:02.440
to work. And fortunately by the time we did the conference it was actually working but

30:02.440 --> 30:10.400
this was yet another squeaky bum issue where we tried to do everything at the last minute.

30:10.400 --> 30:15.020
The first day we had a lot of rooms where the room couldn't hear the remote attendees.

30:15.020 --> 30:20.180
This is the wire problem from the remote. Or the remote attendees couldn't hear the

30:20.180 --> 30:24.760
room because it's a two wire problem. It's not just sound from the remote coming into

30:24.760 --> 30:29.760
the room, it's sound from the room going out to the remotes as well. So we had to have

30:29.760 --> 30:34.040
the sound correctly plugged into BVB. The streaming guys thought they were just plugging

30:34.040 --> 30:38.360
the sound into the streaming. So if you watched the live stream it had the correct sound but

30:38.360 --> 30:42.560
if you were on the BVB thing it was completely silent because they hadn't plugged the sound

30:42.560 --> 30:48.380
in. It's just yet another screw up that we didn't actually think to test out. So this

30:48.380 --> 30:54.360
is how it looks in the sort of conference hall as we were going around it. So this is

30:54.360 --> 31:00.600
the panel you can see. This is what BVB looks like pretty much in a classroom situation.

31:00.600 --> 31:06.560
This is the presentation which you can actually minimize if you click this button but obviously

31:06.560 --> 31:10.800
we thought that the AV people might be able to click the minimize button when the conversation

31:10.800 --> 31:14.780
is going on and then click it back again. No, it didn't really work. They didn't really

31:14.780 --> 31:19.740
want to do this. So we just kept everything up. This is the attendees panel which is all

31:19.740 --> 31:24.360
scrolling which is nice but if you think about it that's not really what you want to see

31:24.360 --> 31:30.280
in the conference. The chat panel if you click this will pop out and come here and this,

31:30.280 --> 31:34.340
the rest of this will really shrink which is also not really what the attendees did.

31:34.340 --> 31:38.080
So what we should have done is have the chat panel down here and get rid of the attendee

31:38.080 --> 31:43.720
list or make it pop out only. So we put this on our to-do list for next time because it's

31:43.720 --> 31:48.740
sort of nice to have but it wasn't essential to getting the conference working. This is

31:48.740 --> 31:54.240
actually an excerpt from the RISC-V micro conference. So Atish Patra is actually asking

31:54.240 --> 31:59.320
a remote question. You can see that he's asking it of a member of the audience so we've switched

31:59.320 --> 32:03.080
to the audience camera view because ideally there would have been two cameras here, one

32:03.080 --> 32:06.520
of the audience, one of the speaker and he could have switched between them but we screwed

32:06.520 --> 32:14.360
up and didn't get that working in time. The tab also includes shared notes which goes

32:14.360 --> 32:21.400
to a back end on ether pads so the remote audience can also see the shared notes and

32:21.400 --> 32:27.200
they can also click on the pop up and these buttons here actually allow you to mute people

32:27.200 --> 32:32.120
who are not supposed to be speaking when they are because in a remote conference you get

32:32.120 --> 32:36.300
lots of people who forget to meet their microphone and then have a conversation with their wife

32:36.300 --> 32:42.600
or their, you know, their significant other. This happens quite often. The way BBB is set

32:42.600 --> 32:47.760
up is that anybody can meet anybody but we thought that might be a bad idea because it's

32:47.760 --> 32:52.080
sort of, you know, cantankerous kernel developers, you never quite know who they'll mute. And

32:52.080 --> 32:56.560
once you've muted somebody you can't unmute them, they can only unmute themselves because

32:56.560 --> 32:59.920
this is a sort of, you know, you can't be unmuting people while they're going to the

32:59.920 --> 33:05.320
bathroom or something, it wouldn't be good on a conference. And we figured this might

33:05.320 --> 33:12.160
be a problem so we'd restricted this functionality to administrators only and then nobody could

33:12.160 --> 33:17.940
figure out who the administrators were so it became a bit of a problem. The video overlays

33:17.940 --> 33:25.120
work quite well so, I mean, this is pretty much a blow up of a 1080p thing and you can

33:25.120 --> 33:29.840
see the Greeking happening in the room. It's very difficult to make out individual attendees

33:29.840 --> 33:36.640
but the sort of remote participants were reasonably visible to most people. So BBB, and especially

33:36.640 --> 33:42.000
you can actually see the way it works with the video muting idea, it's really all you

33:42.000 --> 33:46.540
see are the people participating. Now one of the other things that we'd actually try

33:46.540 --> 33:53.280
to do in the room is the back face, the camera at the back, the camera at the front facing

33:53.280 --> 33:59.400
the back actually had a pan and zoom facility which the AV operators that assured us would

33:59.400 --> 34:04.960
allow them to zoom in on whoever was speaking but in the event what we discovered is that

34:04.960 --> 34:10.480
only two of the AV operators out of our six rooms knew how to use this. So we did get

34:10.480 --> 34:14.320
panning and zooming in some of the rooms but not in all of them. Again, this goes back

34:14.320 --> 34:25.280
to preparation and training. We will do better next time. Yep. And it actually took us quite

34:25.280 --> 34:30.520
a while to get the audio routing right. You'd think that plugging two wires into an AV system

34:30.520 --> 34:37.040
wouldn't be that difficult but in fact it really was. And we finally figured out that

34:37.040 --> 34:43.120
what you had to say to the audio guy is here's a wire from what's effectively a microphone

34:43.120 --> 34:47.880
on the computer. The video guy will give it to you. You just plug it into your fader panel

34:47.880 --> 34:54.040
and remember you have it and you give him a wire for the AV stream that also has to

34:54.040 --> 35:02.480
go into the BBB thing. And eventually we got that to work. But obviously we had other problems.

35:02.480 --> 35:07.000
One of the other things that we'd really thought about was when we get into the room we'd actually

35:07.000 --> 35:11.760
like to have the chat and all the remote attendees on one monitor and then we'd like to have

35:11.760 --> 35:16.680
the presentations on another. So we thought we'll have a two projector set up which sounds

35:16.680 --> 35:22.800
fine until you realize that we have rooms about as big as this and the two projectors

35:22.800 --> 35:28.960
were right over there and right over there. So somebody sitting over there can't see what's

35:28.960 --> 35:33.640
on that projector. Somebody sitting over there can't see what's on that projector. So the

35:33.640 --> 35:38.440
only way we could make it work was to display the same image on both projectors which meant

35:38.440 --> 35:42.240
that two projectors was a complete waste of money and we should have gone for a single

35:42.240 --> 35:47.440
central one as well. So next year we will either try with one or three just to see if

35:47.440 --> 35:55.920
we can actually get this right. Obviously as I said the two camera handling we thought

35:55.920 --> 36:00.920
would be the centerpiece of the technology. The reason why we'd upgraded BBB and caused

36:00.920 --> 36:05.880
all of the React JScript failures on the matrix back end was to get this facility that we

36:05.880 --> 36:10.680
couldn't actually use. So that was not only sleepless nights for one person for a week

36:10.680 --> 36:15.240
to try and get it all to work but complete screw up on the day when everything we thought

36:15.240 --> 36:26.680
we'd bought with that upgrade didn't function. The other problem we had was because the AV

36:26.680 --> 36:31.120
people are actually doing the live streaming and because of the way BBB works there is

36:31.120 --> 36:39.320
no choice other than to actually run the master BBB session that is showing up on both projectors

36:39.320 --> 36:46.400
on their AVmux console. And I had thought this might be a problem as well. So BBB is

36:46.400 --> 36:54.520
very heavily matrix, it's very heavily React JavaScript based and certain browsers handle

36:54.520 --> 36:59.600
it better than other browsers. So it's mostly, it works with Firefox quite well now but it

36:59.600 --> 37:04.560
is mostly optimized for Chromium. So I'd actually already asked them God if we have to do this

37:04.560 --> 37:09.520
what is the built in browser of this TMUX thing and they said oh it's Chrome and I thought

37:09.520 --> 37:18.960
oh God it's going to work. But the problem was that the MUX platform might have used

37:18.960 --> 37:23.760
Chromium as an internal thing but Chromium is open source. So the guys who built the

37:23.760 --> 37:28.680
MUX platform had just basically taken WebKit, gutted some of the JavaScripts and hoped that

37:28.680 --> 37:33.360
that would be okay. And what it really meant was the threading functions of JavaScript

37:33.360 --> 37:38.720
didn't work very well. The result was that it kept dropping out of the conference and

37:38.720 --> 37:45.360
obviously since this is running the AV conference when it drops out the in room chat and the

37:45.360 --> 37:50.400
remote participants fully separate. And the problem is there's no indication that this

37:50.400 --> 37:54.680
has happened from the console unless you happen to be watching very carefully because all

37:54.680 --> 37:59.560
you see is that a microphone disappears from that little icon in the top left that says

37:59.560 --> 38:04.280
hey you're the room and suddenly your microphone's gone. That's the only indication the AV people

38:04.280 --> 38:09.240
had they dropped out. Trying to train them to notice this and reconnect was a bit of

38:09.240 --> 38:15.480
a problem. So we do have automated reconnections on the back end but we will try and integrate

38:15.480 --> 38:20.240
into BVV but when we raised it on the list they looked at us and said well how come you

38:20.240 --> 38:25.520
have this problem because nobody else has this problem. If BVV kept on dropping people

38:25.520 --> 38:30.520
out of the conversation as a matter of course people would have complained. This was a specific

38:30.520 --> 38:36.600
interaction due to the cut down browser and the tmux interface that nobody had anticipated.

38:36.600 --> 38:43.440
Again another screw up from not actually trying it beforehand. So as I said rejoin was manual

38:43.440 --> 38:47.960
assuming the AV guy noticed. One of the good things we did have was in room shepherds who

38:47.960 --> 38:53.840
were committee members so they could actually watch the on screen panel every time the icon

38:53.840 --> 38:57.960
disappeared I could I or one of the other shepherds could run to the back of the room

38:57.960 --> 39:02.640
and pat the AV guy on the shoulder and say you need to rejoin please do this. So we could

39:02.640 --> 39:10.680
make it work with a lot of manual fussing behind the scenes but it wasn't easy. So one

39:10.680 --> 39:17.040
of the other things that we realized is that you know hindsight is 20-20. I mean they might

39:17.040 --> 39:21.080
want to run it from the AV console but they don't have to run the whole thing. What we

39:21.080 --> 39:26.040
could have done is have a separate laptop that actually ran all of the AV connections

39:26.040 --> 39:29.840
under the charge of I won't say somebody competent because it would have been one of me the

39:29.840 --> 39:34.080
kernel developers or somebody but somebody who would pay more attention and then what

39:34.080 --> 39:38.320
we could have done for the vmux guys was to actually give them a VNC session or something

39:38.320 --> 39:45.200
like that into the panels they were projecting over the streaming and everything else and

39:45.200 --> 39:49.240
that way we would have had much more control in the room and we'd have been running a full

39:49.240 --> 39:53.560
fledged browser that wouldn't have had most of the connection problems that we had. But

39:53.560 --> 39:59.080
obviously trying to sort that out on the day was pretty much impossible. Particularly unfortunately

39:59.080 --> 40:05.400
is this AV mux platform is sort of Windows based and Windows does not do VNC very well

40:05.400 --> 40:09.820
and trying to get it to work with RDSP which is the Windows native thing didn't work very

40:09.820 --> 40:15.440
well and we just it was we were in Dublin we didn't have any equipment we had to organize

40:15.440 --> 40:20.360
the parties and deal with online conferences we just couldn't get it to work. So we do

40:20.360 --> 40:27.920
know that for the future we are going to try and do a shareable console. And I need to

40:27.920 --> 40:33.960
leave time for questions I have 10 minutes left. We had a load of other problems as well

40:33.960 --> 40:41.640
as you can see this so I'm in order to try and tell you all the difficulty about doing

40:41.640 --> 40:47.160
this I'm talking up the problems. From the audience's point of view this conference was

40:47.160 --> 40:52.200
actually very successful. We got plaudits from most of the attendees that the interaction

40:52.200 --> 40:57.080
worked as they expected they could have their one on one conversations including between

40:57.080 --> 41:01.880
remote and local people, remote and remote people. So everything appeared to just work

41:01.880 --> 41:06.120
for them modulo you know the problems of not being able to hear the room and having to

41:06.120 --> 41:10.760
rejoin and having to tell people the lost AV and they need to rejoin. They forgave us

41:10.760 --> 41:15.720
for all of that so it was actually highly rated as an incredibly successful conference

41:15.720 --> 41:20.000
but it was a bit like a swan with that you know serene sort of thing swimming over the

41:20.000 --> 41:24.600
surface and a load of committee members frantically paddling underneath to try and get all of

41:24.600 --> 41:32.080
this to stay up and running. Our other big screw up was that we had a committee of 10

41:32.080 --> 41:37.240
people but because this was pandemic not all of the committee could turn up in Dublin and

41:37.240 --> 41:43.000
by the time we got to Dublin we only had two local people who actually understood the system

41:43.000 --> 41:46.720
and could deal with it. Surprisingly enough they're the two people who are actually standing

41:46.720 --> 41:52.760
up on the platform now taking the blame for all of this. But believe me in a conference

41:52.760 --> 41:59.120
with six tracks and AV guys who don't know what they're doing if you want a lot of exercise

41:59.120 --> 42:04.880
please do it with two people but if you want to actually make it work seamlessly and vaguely

42:04.880 --> 42:10.200
competently you need one person who understands the setup in each room. So next time we will

42:10.200 --> 42:15.240
try and do it with a minimum number of people as we have same number of track rooms. Again

42:15.240 --> 42:19.440
it's not rocket science it's perhaps something we should have seen ahead of time but we thought

42:19.440 --> 42:28.360
it would be easy and it wasn't. So to leave a bit of time for questions if you have them.

42:28.360 --> 42:34.120
Running conferences is actually hard so just remember that when you go home from here and

42:34.120 --> 42:38.360
volunteering for a conference is actually an act of public self sacrifice that more

42:38.360 --> 42:44.760
of you should consider because honestly you will find out that it is really hard. Running

42:44.760 --> 42:49.440
online conferences is harder especially if you try and do it yourselves because there

42:49.440 --> 42:54.000
is actually a lot more to do. It is actually more difficult to run an online conference

42:54.000 --> 43:00.760
than it is to run an in-person conference paradoxically. And this is mainly to do with

43:00.760 --> 43:04.920
the integration issues. Everything that doesn't integrate well is either your fault or you

43:04.920 --> 43:10.120
are responsible for integrating it and integrating web stuff even in this magic day and age of

43:10.120 --> 43:14.680
sort of you know web scripting and operators and everything else really doesn't work that

43:14.680 --> 43:21.800
well. And hybrid is really only for masochists. Only do a hybrid conference if you want to

43:21.800 --> 43:26.120
give yourself an untold amount of pain that you can then come and complain to an audience

43:26.120 --> 43:33.520
like you about later. But if you really want to get it right the key is training your AV

43:33.520 --> 43:38.840
people. Do not wait like we did to turn up on the day and say it will be easy. You need

43:38.840 --> 43:43.080
a couple of training sessions a few months beforehand to try and get all of the kinks

43:43.080 --> 43:49.800
sorted out. And having meetings and discussing it doesn't cut it. You need the AV people

43:49.800 --> 43:55.840
to set it all up and preferably have a few people fly out to see the set up, work with

43:55.840 --> 44:02.440
a few remote people so you actually check it out in all of its situations. And obviously

44:02.440 --> 44:06.160
you need to do this in advance. You don't do it on the day of the conference which is

44:06.160 --> 44:13.840
what we try to do. Oh well lesson learned. So with that I think I have about five minutes

44:13.840 --> 44:19.080
for questions. This was actually all done in open source using HTML and CSS. That does

44:19.080 --> 44:24.920
make me a web developer. Proud of it now finally. Obviously you can see that kernel developers

44:24.920 --> 44:30.080
don't quite do web as well as web developers. So if any web developers would like to join

44:30.080 --> 44:35.840
our program committee and become jointly responsible for next year's disaster please come forward.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.720
The presentation is all online and I've also put it up on the link in Pentabath so you

44:40.720 --> 44:44.720
should just be able to click on it. All of the links in the presentation that are highlighted

44:44.720 --> 44:49.280
are clickable if you want to see the URLs. And with that I'll just say thank you and

44:49.280 --> 45:01.080
Mike and I can now answer questions. Oops. You have Mike. Okay we'll share this mic.

45:01.080 --> 45:20.520
Any questions? Please speak loudly into the microphone. Yes. Thank you. From what you

45:20.520 --> 45:26.760
said about the AV set ups in the hotels were there any discussion to just ask hotels to

45:26.760 --> 45:31.640
you know move their stuff and have your own stuff brought in because to me that seems

45:31.640 --> 45:36.800
after your talk to have been an easier solution to just say you know your AV guys and your

45:36.800 --> 45:41.040
AV is probably good but we have really specialized needs could we just bring our own equipment

45:41.040 --> 45:47.840
in? Okay so the question is could we bring our own equipment in? And the answer is pretty

45:47.840 --> 45:53.920
much every hotel no. Because remember they do the AV routing as a very specialized sort

45:53.920 --> 45:59.000
of adaption for the conference rooms. They have a lot of really expensive speakers sometimes

45:59.000 --> 46:04.120
in the ceiling sometimes at the back of the room and they don't want any non-experts touching

46:04.120 --> 46:09.680
it. So what hotels usually have as a clause in their contract is a requirement that you

46:09.680 --> 46:14.720
use their own sound guys and this clause is non-negotiable. We did try and negotiate with

46:14.720 --> 46:19.320
a couple of hotels where we said because we had a few screw ups even in the live streaming

46:19.320 --> 46:23.800
days where the hotel didn't do very well and we thought we could do better. But it's always

46:23.800 --> 46:29.400
come back to us as an absolute no. It's actually very lucky for the ULB guys who are used to

46:29.400 --> 46:33.480
having students handle their equipment and don't seem to have as many hang ups about

46:33.480 --> 46:38.840
it as hotels. So there are people here who can be trained on this equipment who can use

46:38.840 --> 46:44.400
it but pretty much when you're running a conference in a hotel or in a professional conference

46:44.400 --> 46:48.760
hall that we've also been to so community convention center or something you actually

46:48.760 --> 46:53.320
have to use their AV staff you don't get a choice. And that means that you always have

46:53.320 --> 46:57.920
this extra component of people that you have to deal with and they're usually people who

46:57.920 --> 47:02.560
don't really understand fully what your requirements are because it's very difficult to communicate

47:02.560 --> 47:07.040
ahead of time. And these people are usually the people that you don't get to talk to until

47:07.040 --> 47:12.080
you turn up at the conference. So when you have your intermediate AV guys like we had

47:12.080 --> 47:16.760
and you have your meeting with them you always have to make sure that they have enough knowledge

47:16.760 --> 47:20.320
and insight that they can do the knowledge transfer to the sound guys who are going to

47:20.320 --> 47:26.360
be coming in on the day from the hotel. So yeah it's a huge problem and there's almost

47:26.360 --> 47:31.160
nothing you can do to get out of it besides sort of having a very friendly university

47:31.160 --> 47:35.160
who will let you play with their equipment because pretty much nobody in the professional

47:35.160 --> 47:42.640
circuit will let you play with their equipment. I have one question from the chat. Was it

47:42.640 --> 47:50.080
worth it to record the audience? So the question was was it worth it to record the audience?

47:50.080 --> 47:55.320
And the answer to that is actually very much yes because remember in a micro conference

47:55.320 --> 48:00.000
we're stimulating discussions between arbitrary groups of people. So these would be people

48:00.000 --> 48:05.520
who are sitting in the audience physically versus people who are sort of remote. And

48:05.520 --> 48:10.120
in order to have a correct two-way conversation you actually have to be able to see the person

48:10.120 --> 48:14.960
on the other end. And so the whole point of the audience camera, at least when it worked

48:14.960 --> 48:19.560
with the panning and zooming, was that if you were having a remote to local conversation

48:19.560 --> 48:24.680
with the audience the remote people could actually see the local participant. And if

48:24.680 --> 48:30.040
we only had a camera facing the speaker we'd either have to call every participant up to

48:30.040 --> 48:36.240
stand on the stage which wastes time or we'd just have to not have them be able to see

48:36.240 --> 48:40.560
the person they're talking to. And being able to see the person you're talking to is very

48:40.560 --> 48:44.920
important for interactions. There are lots of visual cues that people get wrong. So I

48:44.920 --> 48:52.160
think having an audience camera is actually one of the good benefits of, or at least one

48:52.160 --> 48:56.200
of the benefits the plumbers did and one of the good insights we had to try and get an

48:56.200 --> 49:02.640
interactive conference running. So I wouldn't go back and do no audience camera, no.

49:02.640 --> 49:10.360
Just wanted to get back to what you said about the ULB being willing to allow us to use their

49:10.360 --> 49:13.960
audio equipment. I just want to point out that this has a lot to do with the fact that

49:13.960 --> 49:19.600
we've been doing this for 20 years and they know us. It wasn't always the case and if

49:19.600 --> 49:26.080
you're not false them or you're not working with the ULB this probably isn't the case.

49:26.080 --> 49:32.640
So could you repeat the, I got half the question, no. Yeah it wasn't the question really so

49:32.640 --> 49:38.080
much as to point out that us being allowed to touch the audio equipment here by the ULB

49:38.080 --> 49:41.280
has a lot to do with the fact that we've been doing this for 20 years and they know us.

49:41.280 --> 49:45.840
Okay so the point being made is that ULB only allows the staff here to touch the equipment

49:45.840 --> 49:49.640
because they've been doing it a long time and they've built up trust. The way we work

49:49.640 --> 49:54.960
we tend to go to a different hotel every time we hold plumbers in a different location.

49:54.960 --> 50:01.520
So pretty much even if we could get a trust to build up with a hotel chain we just, we

50:01.520 --> 50:06.880
wouldn't be in the hotel often enough to do it. But the important point to emphasize is

50:06.880 --> 50:13.120
that pretty much 95% of the time you will be forced to work with AV people who are supplied

50:13.120 --> 50:28.640
to you by whoever owns the equipment. You won't get a choice of who does it. Okay. Is

50:28.640 --> 50:40.800
that it? Okay. Well thank you very much indeed.
