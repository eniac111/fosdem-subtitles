1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.720
So yeah, today I'm going to be talking to you about sustaining free and open source

2
0:00:08.720 --> 0:00:12.920
software, exploring community, financial and technical practices.

3
0:00:12.920 --> 0:00:17.680
I was trying to go for the longest title possible.

4
0:00:17.680 --> 0:00:19.180
Do you think it's long enough?

5
0:00:19.180 --> 0:00:20.680
Probably greater than longer.

6
0:00:20.680 --> 0:00:22.080
Okay, so my name's Abby.

7
0:00:22.080 --> 0:00:24.520
I do run open source maintainer programs at GitHub.

8
0:00:24.520 --> 0:00:27.220
I'm also an organizer for Sustain OSS.

9
0:00:27.220 --> 0:00:30.760
And I care lots about maintainers, about the open source ecosystem.

10
0:00:30.760 --> 0:00:33.680
So I'm really excited to talk to you about that today.

11
0:00:33.680 --> 0:00:39.500
So before I dive in, I do want to say thank you to all of these names, all these handles.

12
0:00:39.500 --> 0:00:45.200
About a week ago, I tweeted and tweeted about this talk, but also just asking for examples

13
0:00:45.200 --> 0:00:46.960
of sustainable open source.

14
0:00:46.960 --> 0:00:48.440
And all of you really came through.

15
0:00:48.440 --> 0:00:51.320
There was a lot of responses, a lot of things to think about.

16
0:00:51.320 --> 0:00:55.080
And yeah, it really changed how I was thinking of this talk.

17
0:00:55.080 --> 0:00:58.240
So it actually gave me more work, but I think it was worth it.

18
0:00:58.240 --> 0:01:01.720
So you get to hear some insights from all of these people today.

19
0:01:01.720 --> 0:01:04.200
So thanks, especially if your name's up here.

20
0:01:04.200 --> 0:01:05.880
You're the best.

21
0:01:05.880 --> 0:01:08.500
So here's what we're talking about today.

22
0:01:08.500 --> 0:01:10.980
So it is my first time at Fostem.

23
0:01:10.980 --> 0:01:14.120
So yeah, thank you so much to the organizers for having me here.

24
0:01:14.120 --> 0:01:15.920
Yeah, it's been really fun.

25
0:01:15.920 --> 0:01:17.960
I've really been enjoying this conference.

26
0:01:17.960 --> 0:01:20.680
Everyone told me it was going to be really cold.

27
0:01:20.680 --> 0:01:22.360
I think they forgot that I'm Canadian.

28
0:01:22.360 --> 0:01:26.160
This is really nice weather, so it's great here.

29
0:01:26.160 --> 0:01:27.840
So I don't know what I've been talking about.

30
0:01:27.840 --> 0:01:30.900
But yeah, so I do want to share a little bit about myself, my background, and why I care

31
0:01:30.900 --> 0:01:32.980
so much about FOS.

32
0:01:32.980 --> 0:01:34.800
And then we'll go into sustaining FOS.

33
0:01:34.800 --> 0:01:38.280
And spoiler alert, I do think maintainers are a huge part of this.

34
0:01:38.280 --> 0:01:43.000
And then from there, we'll look at those three lenses around how we can be sustainable through

35
0:01:43.000 --> 0:01:46.680
community, through financial, and through technical practices.

36
0:01:46.680 --> 0:01:47.680
So first, some background.

37
0:01:47.680 --> 0:01:51.120
It's a picture of me and my grandma, my Lola.

38
0:01:51.120 --> 0:01:54.040
So my little brother's there.

39
0:01:54.040 --> 0:01:57.280
There are pictures of me and just my grandma, but I really liked this one, even though my

40
0:01:57.280 --> 0:01:58.560
brother is stealing the show.

41
0:01:58.560 --> 0:01:59.560
I don't know.

42
0:01:59.560 --> 0:02:00.560
It's fun.

43
0:02:00.560 --> 0:02:02.680
And I like how big my eyes look with my glasses.

44
0:02:02.680 --> 0:02:04.080
It's cute.

45
0:02:04.080 --> 0:02:09.200
But I started my career writing open source software at the Ontario Institute for Cancer

46
0:02:09.200 --> 0:02:10.420
Research.

47
0:02:10.420 --> 0:02:14.280
So this was really meaningful work for me, because my grandmother, my Lola, she had passed

48
0:02:14.280 --> 0:02:15.580
away from cancer.

49
0:02:15.580 --> 0:02:20.360
So this idea that I was helping someone else's grandma, someone else's Lola, was really powerful.

50
0:02:20.360 --> 0:02:22.800
And it was really, yeah, really meaningful work.

51
0:02:22.800 --> 0:02:27.760
But the longer I was in academia, the more I realized how often scientists maybe fudged

52
0:02:27.760 --> 0:02:32.560
their data a little bit or not share parts of their data, just that they can get published

53
0:02:32.560 --> 0:02:36.440
or they can get the best results and get tenure or get that funding.

54
0:02:36.440 --> 0:02:39.700
And this was all happening at the expense of real innovation.

55
0:02:39.700 --> 0:02:42.280
So I was really outraged at that.

56
0:02:42.280 --> 0:02:46.360
That's when I got really into open science, especially using open source and open data

57
0:02:46.360 --> 0:02:48.080
to help us find the best innovations.

58
0:02:48.080 --> 0:02:52.000
Because I do think if we're sharing and we're building upon each other's work, that's how

59
0:02:52.000 --> 0:02:54.160
we'll do the best in the world.

60
0:02:54.160 --> 0:02:59.400
So since then, my career has gone from maintaining open science tools to teaching open source

61
0:02:59.400 --> 0:03:01.020
best practices.

62
0:03:01.020 --> 0:03:04.360
And now at GitHub, I'm supporting the maintainers in this new world.

63
0:03:04.360 --> 0:03:06.640
I started about six months ago, so I'm still a bit new.

64
0:03:06.640 --> 0:03:07.640
Actually, seven months.

65
0:03:07.640 --> 0:03:08.640
I counted the other day, yeah.

66
0:03:08.640 --> 0:03:13.680
So I'm going to be sharing some of these experiences as we go through the talk.

67
0:03:13.680 --> 0:03:15.120
All right.

68
0:03:15.120 --> 0:03:18.800
So now Sustaining Foss and supporting maintainers.

69
0:03:18.800 --> 0:03:23.840
So I did frame this talk about sustainability, around sustainability.

70
0:03:23.840 --> 0:03:26.440
I think there's a lot of conversation happening in that space.

71
0:03:26.440 --> 0:03:27.440
I do think it's important.

72
0:03:27.440 --> 0:03:33.000
But after that tweet and the responses I was getting there, I realized I care a lot about

73
0:03:33.000 --> 0:03:37.200
project resilience and how projects are able to survive over time.

74
0:03:37.200 --> 0:03:44.120
So a slight shift, but I think it helped me really think about how are projects resilient

75
0:03:44.120 --> 0:03:48.080
and strong and able to withstand troubles that come their way.

76
0:03:48.080 --> 0:03:54.960
So to me, the biggest factor that affects software's ability to continue is maintenance.

77
0:03:54.960 --> 0:03:58.360
In this changing tech landscape, if something isn't maintained for a while, it will really

78
0:03:58.360 --> 0:04:00.140
quickly become outdated.

79
0:04:00.140 --> 0:04:04.240
So I really like this quote from Toby Longel.

80
0:04:04.240 --> 0:04:06.640
He's an open ecosystem strategist.

81
0:04:06.640 --> 0:04:11.760
And this quote says, in open source, the maintainers working on the source code are the scarce resource

82
0:04:11.760 --> 0:04:13.720
that needs to be protected and nurtured.

83
0:04:13.720 --> 0:04:14.720
And we're missing a bit of context.

84
0:04:14.720 --> 0:04:16.520
He was talking about the commons.

85
0:04:16.520 --> 0:04:21.000
And I'm a little bit too jet-lagged to have a commons and public good conversation right

86
0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:22.000
now.

87
0:04:22.000 --> 0:04:24.000
But I do think this is an important framing.

88
0:04:24.000 --> 0:04:26.680
I think it's important to be thinking about maintainers.

89
0:04:26.680 --> 0:04:31.160
I know Nadia Egbahl in her book, Working in Public, she also frames this problem as the

90
0:04:31.160 --> 0:04:34.600
resources to maintainers' attention and trying to get their time.

91
0:04:34.600 --> 0:04:39.560
But I really like this framing around the person itself of a maintainer.

92
0:04:39.560 --> 0:04:43.520
And really, what can we be doing to support maintainers so then we are best supporting

93
0:04:43.520 --> 0:04:46.680
resilient open source?

94
0:04:46.680 --> 0:04:50.640
So this aligns a lot with what I've seen in movement building where there's a lot of investment

95
0:04:50.640 --> 0:04:54.760
in raising up new leaders so that the movements can continue.

96
0:04:54.760 --> 0:04:58.080
And we also see this in corporations where people are always like, there's a lot of leadership

97
0:04:58.080 --> 0:04:59.080
training.

98
0:04:59.080 --> 0:05:01.400
Like, leaders are really important in communities.

99
0:05:01.400 --> 0:05:03.120
And it's the same for open source.

100
0:05:03.120 --> 0:05:05.960
Maintainers are really important for these communities.

101
0:05:05.960 --> 0:05:10.960
So if we look at supporting maintainers, we're going to look at these three lenses.

102
0:05:10.960 --> 0:05:15.440
And you don't have to address your project with all three of those lenses at once.

103
0:05:15.440 --> 0:05:17.960
I think that's why I made an event diagram.

104
0:05:17.960 --> 0:05:19.040
But we're going to look at these three.

105
0:05:19.040 --> 0:05:22.360
So the first is on the community lens with succession planning.

106
0:05:22.360 --> 0:05:24.920
This one might not be as intuitive, so I'm going to dive into that a little bit more

107
0:05:24.920 --> 0:05:26.320
soon.

108
0:05:26.320 --> 0:05:29.720
The next one in pink is the financial side, so paying maintainers.

109
0:05:29.720 --> 0:05:33.200
And this is what we've heard a lot about lately, getting money to them.

110
0:05:33.200 --> 0:05:38.800
And the third one in blue is on the technical side, making it just easy to use and get started.

111
0:05:38.800 --> 0:05:42.880
So really supporting maintainers by taking away some of the maintainer burden.

112
0:05:42.880 --> 0:05:47.480
But also if a project is suddenly unmaintained, making it easy for someone to just take it

113
0:05:47.480 --> 0:05:50.120
and then run with it.

114
0:05:50.120 --> 0:05:55.200
And then, yeah, just looking at the overlap pieces, say you have like the pink and the

115
0:05:55.200 --> 0:06:01.000
blue, you have the financial piece and the technical piece, but you don't have that community

116
0:06:01.000 --> 0:06:02.000
piece.

117
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:06.600
That's often like corporate open source, especially if they're not really investing in the community.

118
0:06:06.600 --> 0:06:09.000
And I think that's still valid and still fine.

119
0:06:09.000 --> 0:06:14.160
And this way it's okay because they can just pay new maintainers to come on board usually.

120
0:06:14.160 --> 0:06:17.640
So you don't really need all three of them to be completely sustainable.

121
0:06:17.640 --> 0:06:21.440
And then if you have just the green and the blue, so the community side and the technical

122
0:06:21.440 --> 0:06:27.200
side, but not that financial piece, that's like maybe a hobby project.

123
0:06:27.200 --> 0:06:32.720
I also really like how the open source archetypes, they have one, this is a report that was put

124
0:06:32.720 --> 0:06:35.840
out by Open Tech Strategies in Mozilla.

125
0:06:35.840 --> 0:06:38.980
They have an archetype called single maintainer house plant.

126
0:06:38.980 --> 0:06:42.520
So if you're just like a maintainer by yourself, just like watering your little plant, you

127
0:06:42.520 --> 0:06:43.900
don't really need funding.

128
0:06:43.900 --> 0:06:48.240
Funding might actually just hurt the project, but if it doesn't need that much maintenance,

129
0:06:48.240 --> 0:06:49.440
that's also fine.

130
0:06:49.440 --> 0:06:53.760
And then the last piece there, where you have the pink and the green, so you have the financial

131
0:06:53.760 --> 0:06:58.600
piece, you have the community piece, but really it's technically like it's just hard to get

132
0:06:58.600 --> 0:07:01.320
started, hard to use.

133
0:07:01.320 --> 0:07:05.240
That's often specialty libraries where you need like a really deep expertise in something

134
0:07:05.240 --> 0:07:06.500
to get involved.

135
0:07:06.500 --> 0:07:11.060
So those communities tend to have like very few maintainers that are very specialized,

136
0:07:11.060 --> 0:07:14.760
and they're still able to sustain over time.

137
0:07:14.760 --> 0:07:16.720
But they have other pieces to help with that.

138
0:07:16.720 --> 0:07:22.000
And you can probably survive with just one of these three, but I didn't map out all of

139
0:07:22.000 --> 0:07:23.000
them.

140
0:07:23.000 --> 0:07:24.000
It's a lot of things to map.

141
0:07:24.000 --> 0:07:28.400
All right, so the first one we're going to dive into is that succession planning.

142
0:07:28.400 --> 0:07:30.480
It's the community practices.

143
0:07:30.480 --> 0:07:32.820
So I did take this term from the corporate world.

144
0:07:32.820 --> 0:07:37.080
The companies often look at succession planning to make sure that their companies will survive

145
0:07:37.080 --> 0:07:40.120
over long periods of time.

146
0:07:40.120 --> 0:07:42.800
And also you don't need to have this in open source.

147
0:07:42.800 --> 0:07:48.680
Like BDFL is a model that we've seen many successful open source projects with BDFLs.

148
0:07:48.680 --> 0:07:53.200
But I do think that tech is relatively new and open source is even newer.

149
0:07:53.200 --> 0:07:56.960
And that we're only starting to see people retire, or we're starting to see people get

150
0:07:56.960 --> 0:08:00.140
tired of maintaining packages and just delete them all.

151
0:08:00.140 --> 0:08:04.880
So I think we'll be thinking more about succession planning as we're seeing this natural churn

152
0:08:04.880 --> 0:08:08.960
of people go through the ecosystem.

153
0:08:08.960 --> 0:08:10.720
And I did have a conversation after that.

154
0:08:10.720 --> 0:08:12.720
I am really glad I tweeted about this talk.

155
0:08:12.720 --> 0:08:18.040
I forgot to say, I set a goal earlier at the end of last year to tweet every day.

156
0:08:18.040 --> 0:08:20.840
I just wanted to push myself to do something.

157
0:08:20.840 --> 0:08:23.120
And I would not have tweeted that if I didn't have that goal.

158
0:08:23.120 --> 0:08:25.240
I like to just sort of work on things on my own.

159
0:08:25.240 --> 0:08:26.240
But I'm glad I did that.

160
0:08:26.240 --> 0:08:28.060
So I'm working a little bit more open.

161
0:08:28.060 --> 0:08:30.880
I did have a conversation with Deb Goodkin.

162
0:08:30.880 --> 0:08:33.660
She's the executive director of FreeBSD.

163
0:08:33.660 --> 0:08:37.520
And she pointed me towards this quote from Kirk McKusick.

164
0:08:37.520 --> 0:08:40.480
He's one of the original core maintainers for FreeBSD.

165
0:08:40.480 --> 0:08:46.880
But he says, a successful project has to be able to change the leadership.

166
0:08:46.880 --> 0:08:52.520
Otherwise leadership becomes dead wood, which leaves the project rudderless.

167
0:08:52.520 --> 0:08:54.640
And that was Kirk writing this.

168
0:08:54.640 --> 0:08:57.400
So it's really small on my screen.

169
0:08:57.400 --> 0:09:03.520
He's writing a piece on building and running an open source community, the FreeBSD project.

170
0:09:03.520 --> 0:09:08.680
But I do think this view of succession planning is helpful when thinking about the community.

171
0:09:08.680 --> 0:09:11.960
And it's really helpful for large communities where it can be really overwhelming working

172
0:09:11.960 --> 0:09:13.160
with everyone.

173
0:09:13.160 --> 0:09:17.800
But if you're prioritizing succession planning, then you know where you can have the most

174
0:09:17.800 --> 0:09:20.640
impact for your community in the long term.

175
0:09:20.640 --> 0:09:26.200
So an example I'll talk about, I think the easiest way to bring in succession planning

176
0:09:26.200 --> 0:09:30.040
is when you're selecting who to mentor in your project.

177
0:09:30.040 --> 0:09:36.000
So I like to suggest these three criteria so that you're selecting people who are most

178
0:09:36.000 --> 0:09:39.420
likely to become leaders within your project.

179
0:09:39.420 --> 0:09:41.120
So first is mission aligned.

180
0:09:41.120 --> 0:09:44.400
They actually care about this work and want it to succeed.

181
0:09:44.400 --> 0:09:48.960
So I know you've probably seen many people come to your project that are more extractive.

182
0:09:48.960 --> 0:09:51.800
They don't care as much about the mission, but they just want something from the project.

183
0:09:51.800 --> 0:09:53.720
They just want to get something out of it.

184
0:09:53.720 --> 0:09:56.480
It's still good to have them in the community, you can still welcome them.

185
0:09:56.480 --> 0:10:00.800
I just wouldn't invest a ton of time in them if you're mentoring people.

186
0:10:00.800 --> 0:10:03.600
So first, make sure they're mission aligned, they're there because they actually want the

187
0:10:03.600 --> 0:10:06.520
project to be there long term.

188
0:10:06.520 --> 0:10:07.520
Second, available.

189
0:10:07.520 --> 0:10:12.640
Do they actually have the time and resources to contribute?

190
0:10:12.640 --> 0:10:15.560
And it's great that we have these mentorship programs where they can get paid for their

191
0:10:15.560 --> 0:10:19.360
time so this does open the door for more people.

192
0:10:19.360 --> 0:10:23.000
But if someone really wants to be part of this project but then they don't have the

193
0:10:23.000 --> 0:10:27.880
time, I wouldn't also invest that time into mentorship unless they get that time or unless

194
0:10:27.880 --> 0:10:32.560
you get the funding to help support their time or whatever is needed there.

195
0:10:32.560 --> 0:10:35.920
And then the third one there is willing to learn from whoever is mentoring them.

196
0:10:35.920 --> 0:10:39.120
So you might notice I didn't put skills needed.

197
0:10:39.120 --> 0:10:43.320
I know some projects will add skills as a different set of criteria, but I think it's

198
0:10:43.320 --> 0:10:47.520
much easier to find someone who's just willing to learn those skills that they need.

199
0:10:47.520 --> 0:10:51.280
And there will be a lot of project knowledge that you'll need to transfer onto them as

200
0:10:51.280 --> 0:10:55.320
a new maintainer.

201
0:10:55.320 --> 0:10:59.520
But I would add anything that you really can't be taught you can put there.

202
0:10:59.520 --> 0:11:03.120
Yes, I think that's what I had for this slide.

203
0:11:03.120 --> 0:11:04.120
All right.

204
0:11:04.120 --> 0:11:05.120
So I'm going to look at its case study.

205
0:11:05.120 --> 0:11:06.720
So this is work that I did at Mozilla.

206
0:11:06.720 --> 0:11:09.000
I was running Mozilla Open Leaders.

207
0:11:09.000 --> 0:11:13.680
And each of these dots is a project that went through our training process.

208
0:11:13.680 --> 0:11:15.760
And yes, it was a mentorship program.

209
0:11:15.760 --> 0:11:20.240
So when they entered, they had to apply and we would give them questions based on that

210
0:11:20.240 --> 0:11:22.000
criteria I shared before.

211
0:11:22.000 --> 0:11:27.520
So the mission for this program was really about strengthening open projects and communities

212
0:11:27.520 --> 0:11:28.520
around the world.

213
0:11:28.520 --> 0:11:32.120
So we'd ask some questions around like what does openness mean to you or why do you want

214
0:11:32.120 --> 0:11:36.640
to work open to see if they were the mission aligned or did they just come to get some

215
0:11:36.640 --> 0:11:37.880
training.

216
0:11:37.880 --> 0:11:41.240
We asked questions around like what do you hope to learn from a mentor?

217
0:11:41.240 --> 0:11:42.880
How do you learn best?

218
0:11:42.880 --> 0:11:47.280
And then also made sure that they understood like, hey, we want 10 hours of your week each

219
0:11:47.280 --> 0:11:50.760
time and really setting those expectations.

220
0:11:50.760 --> 0:11:56.480
So by setting those expectations, we set quite a high bar for people coming through.

221
0:11:56.480 --> 0:12:00.880
But I think if we hadn't set that and we were just getting people who maybe wanted to be

222
0:12:00.880 --> 0:12:04.520
mentored, they may not have been willing to give that 10 hours.

223
0:12:04.520 --> 0:12:07.240
But setting them up front like lifted that bar.

224
0:12:07.240 --> 0:12:12.320
So you got more people that were really excited about the mission and like wanted to help.

225
0:12:12.320 --> 0:12:13.320
Yeah.

226
0:12:13.320 --> 0:12:14.320
Oh, yeah.

227
0:12:14.320 --> 0:12:19.240
So then doing that really helps with some incredibly high retention rates.

228
0:12:19.240 --> 0:12:22.940
So especially at the beginning, you'll see the orange dots are the people that came back

229
0:12:22.940 --> 0:12:23.940
and mentored others.

230
0:12:23.940 --> 0:12:27.000
So they actually did become leaders within the community.

231
0:12:27.000 --> 0:12:30.920
So our retention rate was as high as 85% in the early days.

232
0:12:30.920 --> 0:12:37.520
It gets lower as you scale because it is harder to keep that quality up over time.

233
0:12:37.520 --> 0:12:39.320
And then even after the program finished.

234
0:12:39.320 --> 0:12:41.220
So we did spin down this program.

235
0:12:41.220 --> 0:12:46.120
We spent one more round decentralizing it and just working with past graduates to run

236
0:12:46.120 --> 0:12:49.340
10 community led projects.

237
0:12:49.340 --> 0:12:53.800
And many of those are still running today and they continue to mentor hundreds of students,

238
0:12:53.800 --> 0:12:56.280
not students, projects a year.

239
0:12:56.280 --> 0:13:00.620
And when I last checked, they've collectively raised over a million dollars from funders

240
0:13:00.620 --> 0:13:03.120
like NASA and the Chan Zuckerberg Institute.

241
0:13:03.120 --> 0:13:06.320
And I haven't checked in about a year, so it might be more now.

242
0:13:06.320 --> 0:13:10.280
But it's exciting just to see, even though I wasn't running this anymore, this mission

243
0:13:10.280 --> 0:13:11.280
was still going on.

244
0:13:11.280 --> 0:13:15.200
There's people still learning about open source in their fields.

245
0:13:15.200 --> 0:13:20.280
And I was going to make one more slide with all the people doing this, but I was very

246
0:13:20.280 --> 0:13:23.720
tired today when I was making slides, so I didn't make one for that.

247
0:13:23.720 --> 0:13:24.720
Okay.

248
0:13:24.720 --> 0:13:25.720
All right.

249
0:13:25.720 --> 0:13:26.720
So succession planning.

250
0:13:26.720 --> 0:13:29.440
So just a couple of notes.

251
0:13:29.440 --> 0:13:33.240
Adding a selection step and criteria will really help you prioritize who you're going

252
0:13:33.240 --> 0:13:34.840
to invest time in.

253
0:13:34.840 --> 0:13:37.360
And you just can't mentor everyone.

254
0:13:37.360 --> 0:13:40.840
There's a lot of people that will want your attention in an open source project, but this

255
0:13:40.840 --> 0:13:46.000
is a nice way to sort of filter so that you're prioritizing for the long-term success of

256
0:13:46.000 --> 0:13:48.620
your project.

257
0:13:48.620 --> 0:13:52.440
Another place where succession planning can be helpful is when you're thinking about FOSS

258
0:13:52.440 --> 0:13:56.000
that's incubated at a company or corporate open source.

259
0:13:56.000 --> 0:14:03.520
So if especially if there's open source happening at a company that's not part of the core business,

260
0:14:03.520 --> 0:14:07.800
it might be time to think about where that project will go next in terms of succession

261
0:14:07.800 --> 0:14:08.800
planning.

262
0:14:08.800 --> 0:14:11.840
So a couple examples, maybe that will spin out into foundation.

263
0:14:11.840 --> 0:14:13.880
So an example is the Rust project.

264
0:14:13.880 --> 0:14:19.720
So that was at Mozilla for a very long time, but they spent out there at the Rust Foundation.

265
0:14:19.720 --> 0:14:22.800
Or a partner with other companies for shared governance.

266
0:14:22.800 --> 0:14:26.080
So the example I put there was Kubernetes, which was at Google, but now it's part of

267
0:14:26.080 --> 0:14:27.240
the shared infrastructure.

268
0:14:27.240 --> 0:14:32.840
So a lot of the big tech companies have the shared governance over this shared infrastructure

269
0:14:32.840 --> 0:14:35.800
that they all use.

270
0:14:35.800 --> 0:14:37.480
Okay.

271
0:14:37.480 --> 0:14:39.240
Next circle was the pink one.

272
0:14:39.240 --> 0:14:40.240
Pay maintainers.

273
0:14:40.240 --> 0:14:41.440
Yay.

274
0:14:41.440 --> 0:14:43.240
So some financial practices.

275
0:14:43.240 --> 0:14:44.720
Oh, yeah.

276
0:14:44.720 --> 0:14:50.240
I'm a huge fan of GitHub, I work at GitHub.

277
0:14:50.240 --> 0:14:54.320
But a lot of times when a project joins a foundation, you won't necessarily get money

278
0:14:54.320 --> 0:14:56.320
directly to the maintainers.

279
0:14:56.320 --> 0:15:00.880
You'll get a lot of support and ecosystem support, but I am so glad that there's companies

280
0:15:00.880 --> 0:15:06.160
like this and products like this, like GitHub sponsors, like, thanks, Deb, they're here.

281
0:15:06.160 --> 0:15:07.160
Yay.

282
0:15:07.160 --> 0:15:10.320
StackAid, open source collective, Tidelift.

283
0:15:10.320 --> 0:15:14.360
There's so many different groups just helping money get directly to maintainers, which is

284
0:15:14.360 --> 0:15:15.360
amazing.

285
0:15:15.360 --> 0:15:16.560
And I'm glad we're seeing so many of them.

286
0:15:16.560 --> 0:15:21.560
I actually saw this tweet from Dustin Dorfman this morning when I was still making my slides.

287
0:15:21.560 --> 0:15:26.920
He wrote, if you told me ten years ago we would have multiple businesses building services

288
0:15:26.920 --> 0:15:29.920
to help sustain open source projects, I would have been skeptical.

289
0:15:29.920 --> 0:15:31.720
Can't imagine the next ten.

290
0:15:31.720 --> 0:15:34.240
So I completely agree with Justin.

291
0:15:34.240 --> 0:15:36.360
It's great seeing so many of these.

292
0:15:36.360 --> 0:15:41.160
So just to share a little bit more about GitHub sponsors, there's this explore page.

293
0:15:41.160 --> 0:15:46.360
So if you go there, you'll see the projects that your account depends on and which ones

294
0:15:46.360 --> 0:15:50.840
are eligible for sponsorship to make it a little bit easier for you to sponsor projects.

295
0:15:50.840 --> 0:15:54.960
And one of the first projects that I worked on when I joined GitHub was this maintainer

296
0:15:54.960 --> 0:15:59.520
month sponsorship where we had half a million dollars and we distributed that to across all

297
0:15:59.520 --> 0:16:03.360
of our dependencies just evenly across everyone who had sponsors turned on.

298
0:16:03.360 --> 0:16:08.880
So it's really fun seeing everyone get there like 500 bucks as part of maintainer month.

299
0:16:08.880 --> 0:16:11.280
And that's going to be part of the actual product soon.

300
0:16:11.280 --> 0:16:13.280
So bulk sponsorships are coming out.

301
0:16:13.280 --> 0:16:17.120
So it'll be much easier for you to just upload a list of maintainers that you want to give

302
0:16:17.120 --> 0:16:22.600
money to and then it'll spread it out.

303
0:16:22.600 --> 0:16:25.240
And then just a little bit more about paying maintainers.

304
0:16:25.240 --> 0:16:29.320
The funding landscape has changed dramatically in this past year or so.

305
0:16:29.320 --> 0:16:31.440
There's far more money available in open source.

306
0:16:31.440 --> 0:16:35.720
So the open source collective saw a 30% increase in payment to maintainers.

307
0:16:35.720 --> 0:16:39.520
And there's a lot more emphasis on securing the supply chain, especially after the Biden

308
0:16:39.520 --> 0:16:45.300
administration's announcement with that executive order on improving the nation's cybersecurity.

309
0:16:45.300 --> 0:16:49.160
And then this is an NSF grant and the pathways to enable open source ecosystem.

310
0:16:49.160 --> 0:16:51.960
There's just so much more money going into open source.

311
0:16:51.960 --> 0:16:54.120
I only highlighted like two of them there.

312
0:16:54.120 --> 0:16:55.820
There's a lot.

313
0:16:55.820 --> 0:17:01.920
So it's great that money's there, but how do we actually set projects up in a way that

314
0:17:01.920 --> 0:17:04.040
will give ongoing support to maintainers?

315
0:17:04.040 --> 0:17:09.520
And this is a really complicated question, especially if there's multiple maintainers

316
0:17:09.520 --> 0:17:13.240
on a project, like how do we do this equitably, which maintainers get paid?

317
0:17:13.240 --> 0:17:15.120
I'm not going to answer that here.

318
0:17:15.120 --> 0:17:18.320
Again, I'm far too jet-lagged for that.

319
0:17:18.320 --> 0:17:24.460
But we do have some models that I think we can follow and we can learn from that seem

320
0:17:24.460 --> 0:17:27.800
to work for supporting certain types of open source projects.

321
0:17:27.800 --> 0:17:30.080
I am really excited for the GitHub accelerator.

322
0:17:30.080 --> 0:17:33.040
I think they're gearing up for their first cohort right now.

323
0:17:33.040 --> 0:17:34.840
Applications closed at the end of last year.

324
0:17:34.840 --> 0:17:39.160
But talking to Nathan, she's really interested in seeing these new models arise.

325
0:17:39.160 --> 0:17:43.080
But I'm going to talk about just three models that we have today.

326
0:17:43.080 --> 0:17:44.080
I grouped a few things.

327
0:17:44.080 --> 0:17:47.640
I don't know if you can tell, but I'm a really big fan of the rule of three.

328
0:17:47.640 --> 0:17:50.100
So I will tell you things in threes.

329
0:17:50.100 --> 0:17:52.340
But the first is tips and donations.

330
0:17:52.340 --> 0:17:58.600
So this can be going to an individual or the donations to be going to a foundation.

331
0:17:58.600 --> 0:18:01.920
The second is getting hired at a company to do open source.

332
0:18:01.920 --> 0:18:04.360
And this is when the project is not governed by that company.

333
0:18:04.360 --> 0:18:05.580
It's governed outside.

334
0:18:05.580 --> 0:18:07.640
But they're paying you to do open source.

335
0:18:07.640 --> 0:18:11.560
And then the third one is that the company actually does open source and they're governing

336
0:18:11.560 --> 0:18:12.560
it.

337
0:18:12.560 --> 0:18:14.420
And then you're part of helping that.

338
0:18:14.420 --> 0:18:17.960
So I'm going to go through these three and talk about some examples and sometimes when

339
0:18:17.960 --> 0:18:21.120
it works really well and maybe doesn't.

340
0:18:21.120 --> 0:18:24.760
The first one with the tips and donations, yeah, again, it can be to a foundation or

341
0:18:24.760 --> 0:18:26.120
an individual.

342
0:18:26.120 --> 0:18:28.400
This works really well for visible projects.

343
0:18:28.400 --> 0:18:35.360
View is an example that's gotten a lot of sponsorship and donations.

344
0:18:35.360 --> 0:18:37.540
But Evan is really good at that marketing.

345
0:18:37.540 --> 0:18:40.560
And View is a project that many developers use.

346
0:18:40.560 --> 0:18:43.240
It's very top of the stack.

347
0:18:43.240 --> 0:18:44.240
It's not really hidden.

348
0:18:44.240 --> 0:18:49.840
So people make the cognitive decision to use View, which helps make them make a decision

349
0:18:49.840 --> 0:18:52.040
to sponsor View.

350
0:18:52.040 --> 0:18:53.840
The second is content creators.

351
0:18:53.840 --> 0:18:58.040
Caleb Porzio has written a lot about how he's able to sustain a career just on GitHub

352
0:18:58.040 --> 0:18:59.880
sponsors' donations.

353
0:18:59.880 --> 0:19:03.920
And a lot of that is he's creating content around the open source that he's building.

354
0:19:03.920 --> 0:19:08.160
So it's more of that Twitch stream model where people are excited.

355
0:19:08.160 --> 0:19:10.800
And he's a really good marketer, I think.

356
0:19:10.800 --> 0:19:13.640
So it's great that people are able to work like that.

357
0:19:13.640 --> 0:19:19.680
I also don't think that an open source maintainer has to also be a marketer.

358
0:19:19.680 --> 0:19:23.240
There has to be a way that we can get money to those people that don't naturally have

359
0:19:23.240 --> 0:19:26.480
Caleb's gift for marketing.

360
0:19:26.480 --> 0:19:29.960
And then the third is maintainers in lower cost of living areas.

361
0:19:29.960 --> 0:19:32.120
So I actually interviewed COVID Goil.

362
0:19:32.120 --> 0:19:34.080
I'll go to the next slide.

363
0:19:34.080 --> 0:19:36.120
So here's a little clip.

364
0:19:36.120 --> 0:19:39.440
So I interviewed COVID Goil and Carlos Becker.

365
0:19:39.440 --> 0:19:42.600
COVID maintains Caliber and Carlos maintains a GoReleaser.

366
0:19:42.600 --> 0:19:45.040
Yousafiktor was also in this panel.

367
0:19:45.040 --> 0:19:46.560
But he didn't talk about this topic.

368
0:19:46.560 --> 0:19:47.560
He's there.

369
0:19:47.560 --> 0:19:50.200
But if you watch it, you can see him.

370
0:19:50.200 --> 0:19:54.480
But both of them agreed that the strength of the US dollar really helped.

371
0:19:54.480 --> 0:19:57.120
So Carlos was in Brazil, COVID's in India.

372
0:19:57.120 --> 0:20:02.200
And COVID was saying, like, by moving from the US to India, he was actually able to sustain

373
0:20:02.200 --> 0:20:04.040
himself full time on the open source donations.

374
0:20:04.040 --> 0:20:06.660
He actually has a really cool story.

375
0:20:06.660 --> 0:20:11.480
He talked about how when he was in grad school, his parents would give him some pizza money.

376
0:20:11.480 --> 0:20:13.440
And then something happened with a credit card.

377
0:20:13.440 --> 0:20:14.440
And it stopped working.

378
0:20:14.440 --> 0:20:17.160
So he was like, oh, what if I just turn on sponsorships?

379
0:20:17.160 --> 0:20:19.320
This was before sponsors existed.

380
0:20:19.320 --> 0:20:23.320
So he just turned on like a little PayPal donate button on Caliber.

381
0:20:23.320 --> 0:20:25.880
And he started getting sponsorships.

382
0:20:25.880 --> 0:20:27.160
And people started donating.

383
0:20:27.160 --> 0:20:30.440
And then he was able to have that pizza money that grew to be a little bit more than pizza

384
0:20:30.440 --> 0:20:31.440
money.

385
0:20:31.440 --> 0:20:35.560
And then when it came time, when he and his wife both finished grad school, and they were

386
0:20:35.560 --> 0:20:39.180
thinking about what to do next, COVID was like, oh, maybe I can just do this full time

387
0:20:39.180 --> 0:20:41.200
because they were going to move back to India.

388
0:20:41.200 --> 0:20:42.200
And he was able to.

389
0:20:42.200 --> 0:20:46.520
So I think that's a really cool story, just how certain products are able to survive off

390
0:20:46.520 --> 0:20:47.520
of donations.

391
0:20:47.520 --> 0:20:50.680
But I'll say it's a little tricky.

392
0:20:50.680 --> 0:20:52.680
All right.

393
0:20:52.680 --> 0:20:57.680
The second one is getting hired at a company to do free and open source software.

394
0:20:57.680 --> 0:21:01.640
So this is a great way for a company to have a direct line to the project where they actually

395
0:21:01.640 --> 0:21:04.680
are paying for a maintainer to work on it.

396
0:21:04.680 --> 0:21:08.280
And it's great for the project to just have maintainers stably employed.

397
0:21:08.280 --> 0:21:10.880
So the example I put here was, this is Keely Hammond.

398
0:21:10.880 --> 0:21:12.440
She works at Slack.

399
0:21:12.440 --> 0:21:14.500
And she's an electron maintainer.

400
0:21:14.500 --> 0:21:17.360
And I like this Read Me project piece on her.

401
0:21:17.360 --> 0:21:18.360
So I encourage you to go read it.

402
0:21:18.360 --> 0:21:22.960
But she just talks about being an electron maintainer and working at Slack and just how

403
0:21:22.960 --> 0:21:26.560
she's bringing in more of these non-code contributions.

404
0:21:26.560 --> 0:21:27.720
And we see this model happen a lot.

405
0:21:27.720 --> 0:21:31.920
I think electron is just the one that I'm highlighting here.

406
0:21:31.920 --> 0:21:37.280
But you do have to depend on that company to continually be sponsoring these folks.

407
0:21:37.280 --> 0:21:42.420
And the third one is that the company does free and open source software on their own.

408
0:21:42.420 --> 0:21:45.080
So there's a few ways.

409
0:21:45.080 --> 0:21:47.760
This is a very sparse slide I'm just realizing.

410
0:21:47.760 --> 0:21:52.080
So if it's part of their core business model, I think Next.js and Vercel is a great example

411
0:21:52.080 --> 0:21:56.680
of this, where Vercel sells the hosting services so that it's just really easy for you to deploy

412
0:21:56.680 --> 0:21:59.680
your Next.js apps.

413
0:21:59.680 --> 0:22:03.960
And then I also grouped consulting services as part of this company does fast.

414
0:22:03.960 --> 0:22:05.440
I know some people consult individually.

415
0:22:05.440 --> 0:22:08.620
But a lot of people set up a company to do the consulting.

416
0:22:08.620 --> 0:22:13.440
So companies will hire you for your expertise on that project.

417
0:22:13.440 --> 0:22:15.280
And then you can sustain yourself that way.

418
0:22:15.280 --> 0:22:20.360
So again, from the Twitter thread, the Janus or Yannis, I didn't learn how to pronounce

419
0:22:20.360 --> 0:22:25.240
that, the WebRTC server, they're able to sustain themselves through this consulting

420
0:22:25.240 --> 0:22:27.640
business.

421
0:22:27.640 --> 0:22:32.800
And that works when you're, again, when you're high enough on the stack that people will

422
0:22:32.800 --> 0:22:35.480
realize they're using you.

423
0:22:35.480 --> 0:22:40.440
All right, so yeah, just an overview of what we talked about.

424
0:22:40.440 --> 0:22:43.400
These are the three models that I think work today.

425
0:22:43.400 --> 0:22:46.920
But I still think we need more models.

426
0:22:46.920 --> 0:22:51.120
I know talking to Nathan with that GitHub accelerator, she likes to ask that question,

427
0:22:51.120 --> 0:22:54.200
where is the Etsy model for open source?

428
0:22:54.200 --> 0:23:00.960
Where are the people who just create and then are able to get paid for doing that?

429
0:23:00.960 --> 0:23:04.080
It's hard with open source because software isn't a thing that you can just take.

430
0:23:04.080 --> 0:23:08.160
I'm hoping that this accelerator will help us explore that question and maybe try to

431
0:23:08.160 --> 0:23:10.560
figure out a nice model for that.

432
0:23:10.560 --> 0:23:16.280
All right, and that third lens was the technical practices.

433
0:23:16.280 --> 0:23:19.240
Just make it easy to use and get started with your project technically.

434
0:23:19.240 --> 0:23:21.760
Again, this helps maintain a burden.

435
0:23:21.760 --> 0:23:26.040
Maintainers won't have to walk you through getting your environment set up and everything.

436
0:23:26.040 --> 0:23:30.160
But also, yeah, if the project is suddenly unmaintained, ideally someone can just pick

437
0:23:30.160 --> 0:23:33.200
it up and go.

438
0:23:33.200 --> 0:23:36.400
So a few things, best practices.

439
0:23:36.400 --> 0:23:42.200
The first three I actually took, I was consulting with the UNICEF venture fund.

440
0:23:42.200 --> 0:23:46.660
This is actually a requirement for people to graduate from their incubator.

441
0:23:46.660 --> 0:23:49.000
They need to have documentation for everything.

442
0:23:49.000 --> 0:23:56.840
They need to have greater than 80% code coverage for tests and they have CICD involved.

443
0:23:56.840 --> 0:23:59.980
And then the cloud developer environment, just making it easy for people to get started

444
0:23:59.980 --> 0:24:02.360
without having to figure out their local machine.

445
0:24:02.360 --> 0:24:03.760
I think makes a big difference.

446
0:24:03.760 --> 0:24:08.200
Okay, so we're going to go through each of these again.

447
0:24:08.200 --> 0:24:16.080
With documentation, I know I already coded Kirk McKusick, but when I asked Deb, what

448
0:24:16.080 --> 0:24:21.080
did FreeBSD do really well early on that led to where it is today?

449
0:24:21.080 --> 0:24:25.680
And Kirk's response, he gave me a huge list, but one of them was emphasized documentation

450
0:24:25.680 --> 0:24:26.920
from the start.

451
0:24:26.920 --> 0:24:32.000
So making sure you're documenting things, really important.

452
0:24:32.000 --> 0:24:36.640
The next piece for testing in CICD, again, it's just so much easier for people to come

453
0:24:36.640 --> 0:24:39.040
in and contribute to your code if there are tests.

454
0:24:39.040 --> 0:24:41.840
They can realize when something's broken.

455
0:24:41.840 --> 0:24:45.160
It's easier for you as a maintainer to know when you can merge something in or when you

456
0:24:45.160 --> 0:24:46.160
shouldn't.

457
0:24:46.160 --> 0:24:50.740
And then this is just a little gift showing how nice it is to have this all integrated

458
0:24:50.740 --> 0:24:57.400
using GitHub actions where everything's just all there together with your code.

459
0:24:57.400 --> 0:24:59.200
And then the last one, that cloud developer environment.

460
0:24:59.200 --> 0:25:03.520
I think Codespaces has been really nice for this.

461
0:25:03.520 --> 0:25:05.680
And you can just use the green button.

462
0:25:05.680 --> 0:25:07.400
We missed it in the animation.

463
0:25:07.400 --> 0:25:11.440
But then it launches this cloud IDE and then you're just writing the code right away.

464
0:25:11.440 --> 0:25:16.200
And now that Codespaces is offering 60 hours free every month for each individual, this

465
0:25:16.200 --> 0:25:20.660
is a great way for people to start coming into your project.

466
0:25:20.660 --> 0:25:24.040
And I was going to bring some of these business cards so you can talk to Craig.

467
0:25:24.040 --> 0:25:26.640
So Craig, he loves open source.

468
0:25:26.640 --> 0:25:32.000
Again, I am jet-lagged and I forgot these business cards at this event venue for later

469
0:25:32.000 --> 0:25:33.000
today.

470
0:25:33.000 --> 0:25:36.160
But you can take a picture of this if you want to talk to Craig.

471
0:25:36.160 --> 0:25:37.720
That's the link.

472
0:25:37.720 --> 0:25:43.220
And he's more than willing to help you get Codespaces set up so that individuals can

473
0:25:43.220 --> 0:25:45.400
just come to your project and get started quickly.

474
0:25:45.400 --> 0:25:46.720
All right.

475
0:25:46.720 --> 0:25:49.880
So just an overview.

476
0:25:49.880 --> 0:25:52.240
Supporting maintainers through these three lenses.

477
0:25:52.240 --> 0:25:54.880
For the community side, there's succession planning.

478
0:25:54.880 --> 0:25:57.200
From the financial side, paying them.

479
0:25:57.200 --> 0:26:01.320
From the technical side, making it really easy to use and get started.

480
0:26:01.320 --> 0:26:07.720
So if you are interested in any of these conversations at Sustain, I am one of the Sustain OSS organizers.

481
0:26:07.720 --> 0:26:12.100
We do have a conversation every other Friday where we talk about topics like this.

482
0:26:12.100 --> 0:26:14.560
So a lot of the information I got was from those conversations.

483
0:26:14.560 --> 0:26:19.240
So you can go to Sustain's discourse over there.

484
0:26:19.240 --> 0:26:23.040
But I also I run GitHub's open source maintainer program.

485
0:26:23.040 --> 0:26:26.920
So if you want to talk about this with other maintainers, we do have a private maintainer

486
0:26:26.920 --> 0:26:30.600
community that we're just relaunching some new programming.

487
0:26:30.600 --> 0:26:36.100
So if you go there, you can request an invitation to the community and get involved.

488
0:26:36.100 --> 0:26:37.720
So huge thanks to everyone.

489
0:26:37.720 --> 0:26:40.400
I really appreciate being here.

490
0:26:40.400 --> 0:26:41.400
You can find me.

491
0:26:41.400 --> 0:26:42.880
I'm Abby Kabs on GitHub and Twitter.

492
0:26:42.880 --> 0:26:44.960
I'm also on Mastodon.

493
0:26:44.960 --> 0:26:55.800
And yeah, thank you so much for having me.

494
0:26:55.800 --> 0:26:58.240
I'll now take questions.

495
0:26:58.240 --> 0:26:59.240
Thank you, Abigail.

496
0:26:59.240 --> 0:27:01.400
We have questions for Abigail.

497
0:27:01.400 --> 0:27:02.400
Just raise your hands.

498
0:27:02.400 --> 0:27:06.920
I can get the mic to you.

499
0:27:06.920 --> 0:27:10.960
As I was preparing, I was like, oh, this will be easier if I have a long question period.

500
0:27:10.960 --> 0:27:13.760
But now I'm realizing I'm really tired.

501
0:27:13.760 --> 0:27:16.080
So please be nice to me with your questions.

502
0:27:16.080 --> 0:27:17.080
Hi.

503
0:27:17.080 --> 0:27:18.080
Hi.

504
0:27:18.080 --> 0:27:21.620
Thanks for the talk.

505
0:27:21.620 --> 0:27:24.680
So you are talking about ways to become a maintainer.

506
0:27:24.680 --> 0:27:33.480
There is another way that you don't talk about, which is working at a company and then convincing

507
0:27:33.480 --> 0:27:39.240
your CEO to open source, for example, your core business.

508
0:27:39.240 --> 0:27:48.320
And so if I was CEO of a company, how would you convince me to switch to open source?

509
0:27:48.320 --> 0:27:49.320
Oh.

510
0:27:49.320 --> 0:27:50.320
All right.

511
0:27:50.320 --> 0:27:51.320
Yeah.

512
0:27:51.320 --> 0:27:55.000
So you're saying that the other way to survive as open source project is to convince your

513
0:27:55.000 --> 0:27:57.800
company to run an open source business.

514
0:27:57.800 --> 0:27:58.800
Indeed.

515
0:27:58.800 --> 0:27:59.800
Yeah.

516
0:27:59.800 --> 0:28:02.240
So I think there's a lot of advantages to working open.

517
0:28:02.240 --> 0:28:03.240
I've talked about them before.

518
0:28:03.240 --> 0:28:05.200
I don't have them all written here.

519
0:28:05.200 --> 0:28:10.640
But big ones is better products when you have a diverse community contributing, especially

520
0:28:10.640 --> 0:28:15.600
if your company isn't representing the diversity of the audience that you're working for or

521
0:28:15.600 --> 0:28:16.600
serving.

522
0:28:16.600 --> 0:28:18.320
Having that, that's good.

523
0:28:18.320 --> 0:28:23.280
Reduce production costs if you're sharing it across a big group.

524
0:28:23.280 --> 0:28:25.600
And also reduce support costs.

525
0:28:25.600 --> 0:28:30.000
Often if your company is, if your community is answering each other's support questions,

526
0:28:30.000 --> 0:28:33.160
that's another way for reducing costs.

527
0:28:33.160 --> 0:28:35.440
And what's the other one?

528
0:28:35.440 --> 0:28:41.380
Oh, also, if you want to be a de facto standard or if you want to be a platform by giving

529
0:28:41.380 --> 0:28:46.700
something away for free, more people adopt it and then you can become that platform.

530
0:28:46.700 --> 0:28:49.860
So we see that with Android.

531
0:28:49.860 --> 0:28:54.840
So those are a few of the reasons I'd give off the top of my head, too.

532
0:28:54.840 --> 0:28:59.480
But it would depend a lot on what company I'm talking to and what their priorities are.

533
0:28:59.480 --> 0:29:03.440
And it's tricky to find a good business model that works with open source, but when you

534
0:29:03.440 --> 0:29:06.480
do, it's beautiful.

535
0:29:06.480 --> 0:29:07.480
Thanks a lot.

536
0:29:07.480 --> 0:29:15.040
What would you answer to someone saying I'm not going to open source my code because I

537
0:29:15.040 --> 0:29:18.600
fear that people will be stealing it?

538
0:29:18.600 --> 0:29:20.720
Sorry, could you repeat?

539
0:29:20.720 --> 0:29:23.600
You don't want to open source your code because?

540
0:29:23.600 --> 0:29:28.520
People would be stealing it and copying basically your product.

541
0:29:28.520 --> 0:29:30.760
Oh, because you don't want it to be copied?

542
0:29:30.760 --> 0:29:31.760
Yeah, exactly.

543
0:29:31.760 --> 0:29:32.760
You don't want it stolen?

544
0:29:32.760 --> 0:29:35.120
Yeah, that is a tricky one.

545
0:29:35.120 --> 0:29:37.160
You could license it less permissively.

546
0:29:37.160 --> 0:29:42.120
Instead of someone copies it, they'll have to license it the same way.

547
0:29:42.120 --> 0:29:45.000
You're answering really tough, you're asking tough questions.

548
0:29:45.000 --> 0:29:47.080
I asked for easy ones.

549
0:29:47.080 --> 0:29:49.520
But no, this is important.

550
0:29:49.520 --> 0:29:56.200
I say, yeah, you have to structure your business in a way where it doesn't matter if someone

551
0:29:56.200 --> 0:29:57.360
takes your code.

552
0:29:57.360 --> 0:30:03.040
So the example I gave with Next.js and Vercel, anyone can take that, anyone can run it and

553
0:30:03.040 --> 0:30:10.400
do it themselves, but they're selling the server time and that computing time.

554
0:30:10.400 --> 0:30:13.560
So it doesn't matter to them if it gets copied.

555
0:30:13.560 --> 0:30:14.920
But I don't know.

556
0:30:14.920 --> 0:30:16.440
Copying stuff, that's more innovation.

557
0:30:16.440 --> 0:30:19.040
It's better for the world often.

558
0:30:19.040 --> 0:30:20.040
Thank you.

559
0:30:20.040 --> 0:30:21.160
Thanks a lot.

560
0:30:21.160 --> 0:30:22.880
Any easier questions?

561
0:30:22.880 --> 0:30:32.520
There's a couple.

562
0:30:32.520 --> 0:30:33.520
You're next.

563
0:30:33.520 --> 0:30:34.520
Hi.

564
0:30:34.520 --> 0:30:39.560
Do you think GitHub itself will be open source in the future?

565
0:30:39.560 --> 0:30:41.840
Do I think GitHub itself will be open source in the future?

566
0:30:41.840 --> 0:30:45.440
I know that, is this recorded?

567
0:30:45.440 --> 0:30:48.480
Yes, it is.

568
0:30:48.480 --> 0:30:50.440
I'm sure it's fine if I say this.

569
0:30:50.440 --> 0:30:55.480
I know with Thomas Stomkey, he's the CEO of GitHub, he said in the past, what's stopping

570
0:30:55.480 --> 0:30:59.720
us if we open source GitHub right now, we just wouldn't be able to handle all the contributions

571
0:30:59.720 --> 0:31:01.240
and all the community coming in.

572
0:31:01.240 --> 0:31:04.640
I think that's one of the big reasons why they're not doing it.

573
0:31:04.640 --> 0:31:07.400
I wouldn't rule it out, maybe eventually.

574
0:31:07.400 --> 0:31:13.400
But yeah, our business model doesn't really, yeah, it's the code itself, it's not there.

575
0:31:13.400 --> 0:31:17.360
It's more the hosting and the CI CD, code spaces, things like that, where they're generating

576
0:31:17.360 --> 0:31:18.360
the revenue.

577
0:31:18.360 --> 0:31:20.920
I think like, oh, pilot now, yeah.

578
0:31:20.920 --> 0:31:21.920
Thank you.

579
0:31:21.920 --> 0:31:22.920
Thanks.

580
0:31:22.920 --> 0:31:23.920
Hard questions again.

581
0:31:23.920 --> 0:31:25.160
I hope it's okay, I said.

582
0:31:25.160 --> 0:31:27.240
I'm sure no one will report me.

583
0:31:27.240 --> 0:31:29.680
Oh, this person was next.

584
0:31:29.680 --> 0:31:30.680
Okay.

585
0:31:30.680 --> 0:31:31.680
After that.

586
0:31:31.680 --> 0:31:32.680
Okay.

587
0:31:32.680 --> 0:31:33.680
Hi.

588
0:31:33.680 --> 0:31:36.440
Thanks for the talk.

589
0:31:36.440 --> 0:31:42.280
What would be your approach of sustaining a conference app like the Fostem one, which

590
0:31:42.280 --> 0:31:51.280
is only available for a weekend and then people do other things over the year and, yeah, like,

591
0:31:51.280 --> 0:31:53.240
how do you go about this?

592
0:31:53.240 --> 0:31:55.440
How would I go about sustaining a conference like Fostem?

593
0:31:55.440 --> 0:31:58.840
I think Fostem has done a really good job sustaining itself.

594
0:31:58.840 --> 0:32:00.200
It's grown so much.

595
0:32:00.200 --> 0:32:01.600
8,000 people.

596
0:32:01.600 --> 0:32:04.560
It's just amazing to see the community come together and people get really excited about

597
0:32:04.560 --> 0:32:07.880
it.

598
0:32:07.880 --> 0:32:10.720
I don't know if I'd do anything that much differently.

599
0:32:10.720 --> 0:32:15.560
I think from what you said with how it happens only once a year, are you thinking about,

600
0:32:15.560 --> 0:32:18.640
like, keeping people engaged through the year?

601
0:32:18.640 --> 0:32:23.280
Then I might start doing more online things in between us touch points or having more

602
0:32:23.280 --> 0:32:29.440
local things so people can have their Fostem in their city, the local meetups, just to

603
0:32:29.440 --> 0:32:31.240
keep people engaged over time.

604
0:32:31.240 --> 0:32:32.520
But I don't know.

605
0:32:32.520 --> 0:32:36.560
Fostem seems to be going really strong unless there's something I don't know.

606
0:32:36.560 --> 0:32:37.560
Yeah.

607
0:32:37.560 --> 0:32:38.560
Yeah.

608
0:32:38.560 --> 0:32:48.120
Thank you so much for your great talk.

609
0:32:48.120 --> 0:32:53.360
I was a little bit surprised when you mentioned in the discussion about how to sustain a project

610
0:32:53.360 --> 0:33:00.600
financially that there was the case example of a person that moved to India and was able

611
0:33:00.600 --> 0:33:03.920
to sustain itself by working on Foste, which is fantastic.

612
0:33:03.920 --> 0:33:11.080
But you used the word surviving, which seemed a little, yeah, it just surprised me because

613
0:33:11.080 --> 0:33:16.360
I think everybody can agree that people that maintain full-time Foste projects, which is

614
0:33:16.360 --> 0:33:23.960
the infrastructure of a lot of the world, of IT really, should be, well, we all hope

615
0:33:23.960 --> 0:33:30.360
that one day we'll be able to pay these people a reasonable salary for their efforts and

616
0:33:30.360 --> 0:33:31.360
not just surviving.

617
0:33:31.360 --> 0:33:37.440
Now, with that said, like you say, it's tricky to find business models that can financially

618
0:33:37.440 --> 0:33:39.280
sustain these projects.

619
0:33:39.280 --> 0:33:43.200
And GitHub is a company that has done so much for open source and plays such an important

620
0:33:43.200 --> 0:33:48.120
role and it also has enabled a lot of funding to start to arrive to maintainers.

621
0:33:48.120 --> 0:33:56.240
Now, do you think that GitHub is now done finding new ways to find, like, new models

622
0:33:56.240 --> 0:34:03.040
to sustain developers or is the conversation with GitHub still open where we could, you

623
0:34:03.040 --> 0:34:08.480
know, provide further feedback and provide novel ideas to tackle the business model of

624
0:34:08.480 --> 0:34:10.360
how to tackle the problem?

625
0:34:10.360 --> 0:34:12.400
Is GitHub open to new ideas?

626
0:34:12.400 --> 0:34:15.440
Yes, GitHub is open to new ideas.

627
0:34:15.440 --> 0:34:17.280
Actually join that private maintainers group.

628
0:34:17.280 --> 0:34:21.360
I think that would be a really interesting avenue to have those kinds of conversations.

629
0:34:21.360 --> 0:34:24.680
And I think a lot of those, one of the big reasons why the GitHub Accelerator was set

630
0:34:24.680 --> 0:34:28.440
up was to help us try to find these models and better ways to pay people.

631
0:34:28.440 --> 0:34:32.200
Like you said, I probably shouldn't have used the word surviving.

632
0:34:32.200 --> 0:34:34.600
It's nice that COVID was able to do that.

633
0:34:34.600 --> 0:34:36.360
But that shouldn't have to be the norm.

634
0:34:36.360 --> 0:34:42.360
There's no way we could make all the open source maintainers live in India.

635
0:34:42.360 --> 0:34:43.360
I'm true.

636
0:34:43.360 --> 0:34:44.360
It's nice there.

637
0:34:44.360 --> 0:34:48.120
But, yeah, there has to be a better way that we can actually sustain these people.

638
0:34:48.120 --> 0:34:50.560
So I think there's still a missing link.

639
0:34:50.560 --> 0:34:53.560
So I think you've identified there's still this missing piece.

640
0:34:53.560 --> 0:34:55.400
And I don't really know the answer.

641
0:34:55.400 --> 0:34:56.840
There are people having these conversations.

642
0:34:56.840 --> 0:34:58.880
And we're definitely open to hearing your thoughts.

643
0:34:58.880 --> 0:34:59.880
Thank you very much.

644
0:34:59.880 --> 0:35:00.880
I have a question.

645
0:35:00.880 --> 0:35:01.880
Oh, yeah.

646
0:35:01.880 --> 0:35:08.400
Yeah, you did talk about, I just have, my question would be a follow up, like similar

647
0:35:08.400 --> 0:35:14.240
to what he just said about the financial maintenance of open source practitioners.

648
0:35:14.240 --> 0:35:16.080
So like, do you guys have a mechanism?

649
0:35:16.080 --> 0:35:21.400
How do you do, determine, how do you reward somebody that is doing, like that is maintaining

650
0:35:21.400 --> 0:35:23.960
an open source platform?

651
0:35:23.960 --> 0:35:26.960
How do you determine how much he should be rewarded?

652
0:35:26.960 --> 0:35:28.720
Sorry, what was the question?

653
0:35:28.720 --> 0:35:32.760
Like how do you, how do you determine how much should someone be rewarded?

654
0:35:32.760 --> 0:35:35.160
Oh, how to determine how much someone is worth?

655
0:35:35.160 --> 0:35:36.160
Yeah.

656
0:35:36.160 --> 0:35:41.000
How he's rewarded, like for his, for his involvement in an open source project.

657
0:35:41.000 --> 0:35:42.000
Yeah, yeah.

658
0:35:42.000 --> 0:35:43.000
Yeah.

659
0:35:43.000 --> 0:35:47.320
Because like, for example, you might think like, you have two people from different locations,

660
0:35:47.320 --> 0:35:49.080
all contributing the same amount of hours.

661
0:35:49.080 --> 0:35:50.080
Yeah, yeah.

662
0:35:50.080 --> 0:35:54.000
And you might be receiving different paycheck at the end of the month.

663
0:35:54.000 --> 0:35:55.000
Yeah.

664
0:35:55.000 --> 0:35:56.000
Yeah, no.

665
0:35:56.000 --> 0:36:01.400
And I think just the question for everyone, how do you, like if you have multiple maintainers,

666
0:36:01.400 --> 0:36:03.360
how do you know how much money should go to each person?

667
0:36:03.360 --> 0:36:06.600
And I think that's a really big question today.

668
0:36:06.600 --> 0:36:09.760
And I wasn't prepared to answer that in this talk.

669
0:36:09.760 --> 0:36:13.920
But I think, no, I've definitely heard of some projects where like one person is maybe

670
0:36:13.920 --> 0:36:16.600
in India, the other person's in North America.

671
0:36:16.600 --> 0:36:20.920
And then if they pay them evenly, the cost of living is so different.

672
0:36:20.920 --> 0:36:21.920
It just causes issues.

673
0:36:21.920 --> 0:36:24.880
Or like if one person started the project and they're still getting paid but they're

674
0:36:24.880 --> 0:36:28.320
not an active maintainer anymore, like what happens there?

675
0:36:28.320 --> 0:36:29.760
There's a lot of open questions like that.

676
0:36:29.760 --> 0:36:31.880
And I think that really depends on the project.

677
0:36:31.880 --> 0:36:34.080
It really depends on the project governance and dynamic.

678
0:36:34.080 --> 0:36:36.920
It's really, it's a human, human problem.

679
0:36:36.920 --> 0:36:37.920
Yeah.

680
0:36:37.920 --> 0:36:38.960
But I agree.

681
0:36:38.960 --> 0:36:40.240
That is a big problem today.

682
0:36:40.240 --> 0:36:43.400
And it's a big problem for open source.

683
0:36:43.400 --> 0:36:45.400
How much time do we have?

684
0:36:45.400 --> 0:36:46.720
Okay.

685
0:36:46.720 --> 0:36:48.040
Okay.

686
0:36:48.040 --> 0:36:50.840
So this might be the last question, I think.

687
0:36:50.840 --> 0:36:51.840
Yeah.

688
0:36:51.840 --> 0:36:52.840
I'll come here.

689
0:36:52.840 --> 0:36:53.840
Yeah.

690
0:36:53.840 --> 0:36:54.840
Hi.

691
0:36:54.840 --> 0:36:56.840
I'm a member of several organizations.

692
0:36:56.840 --> 0:37:00.080
And we are dealing with, in all of them, we are dealing with the same problem.

693
0:37:00.080 --> 0:37:02.600
We have new members coming in every year.

694
0:37:02.600 --> 0:37:05.400
And there is nobody to give them orders, basically.

695
0:37:05.400 --> 0:37:07.800
They would be very happy to help.

696
0:37:07.800 --> 0:37:09.480
But nobody tells them how.

697
0:37:09.480 --> 0:37:14.160
How can we get these people who are basically acting as middle managers for these organizations?

698
0:37:14.160 --> 0:37:15.520
Oh, man.

699
0:37:15.520 --> 0:37:16.520
Yeah.

700
0:37:16.520 --> 0:37:19.200
So if you're in an organization, you have new people coming in, but then no one is telling

701
0:37:19.200 --> 0:37:21.440
them what to do and how to help.

702
0:37:21.440 --> 0:37:25.200
I think that's where establishing mentors is really important.

703
0:37:25.200 --> 0:37:32.800
And just like finding people in your community already that's willing to onboard others.

704
0:37:32.800 --> 0:37:36.320
So that's why I really like programs like GSOT, Google Summer of Code.

705
0:37:36.320 --> 0:37:41.200
Because it's good for bringing in the newcomers, but it's also good at like finding mentors

706
0:37:41.200 --> 0:37:42.240
in the community.

707
0:37:42.240 --> 0:37:44.840
And this might be the first time they're stepping up in leadership.

708
0:37:44.840 --> 0:37:48.360
So that's a nice incentive because they get a little bit of a kickback from Google also

709
0:37:48.360 --> 0:37:50.240
for mentoring.

710
0:37:50.240 --> 0:37:53.480
And they get like the mentor summit and things like that.

711
0:37:53.480 --> 0:37:56.080
So yeah.

712
0:37:56.080 --> 0:37:57.520
I would think about it that way.

713
0:37:57.520 --> 0:37:58.840
What can you do to encourage mentors?

714
0:37:58.840 --> 0:38:00.600
It might be making a role for it.

715
0:38:00.600 --> 0:38:05.280
It might be giving them special titles and giving them some fancy thing.

716
0:38:05.280 --> 0:38:06.280
I don't know.

717
0:38:06.280 --> 0:38:07.280
A special dinner.

718
0:38:07.280 --> 0:38:08.760
Depends on what your community likes.

719
0:38:08.760 --> 0:38:09.760
Thank you.

720
0:38:09.760 --> 0:38:10.760
Cool.

721
0:38:10.760 --> 0:38:13.360
I think that's all for time.

722
0:38:13.360 --> 0:38:14.960
I'm around.

723
0:38:14.960 --> 0:38:15.960
So you can come chat with me.

724
0:38:15.960 --> 0:38:18.120
I did bring stickers and buttons.

725
0:38:18.120 --> 0:38:20.120
So you're welcome to come up here and get some.

726
0:38:20.120 --> 0:38:24.480
I have slightly less than I had for my talk this morning where I accidentally gave far

727
0:38:24.480 --> 0:38:25.640
too much away.

728
0:38:25.640 --> 0:38:28.240
But this is how much is here.

729
0:38:28.240 --> 0:38:29.240
So thanks everyone.

730
0:38:29.240 --> 0:38:45.120
I'll be chatting with you.
