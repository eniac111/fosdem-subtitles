00:00.000 --> 00:07.700
Hello, you all.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.700
Morning creatures.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.260
Good morning.

00:10.260 --> 00:16.380
We're about to start the talks of the day and I'll leave you with to be as Augsburga,

00:16.380 --> 00:23.280
who will be talking about how open source can leverage more sustainability in the technology.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.100
So welcome, welcome.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.080
Yeah, welcome also from my side.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.960
So I'm actually working in atmospheric science.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.520
So by education I'm an aerospace engineer.

00:37.520 --> 00:44.840
I'm in my day job calibrating satellite instruments for atmospheric science.

00:44.840 --> 00:54.620
But let's say in my private time I do this professional hobby so I'm actually investigating

00:54.620 --> 01:02.020
with some other people how does open source can have a significant impact on environmental

01:02.020 --> 01:04.660
sustainability.

01:04.660 --> 01:11.820
And we created this project within a small community called Prototypes that is actually

01:11.820 --> 01:16.660
investigating multiple ways how to increase the sustainability of our environment with

01:16.660 --> 01:19.100
different open source projects.

01:19.100 --> 01:26.420
And this project was started with a friend of mine and me about two and a half years

01:26.420 --> 01:31.700
ago within a pandemic so we had a lot of time and we realized, okay, there's actually no

01:31.700 --> 01:39.340
overview about what open source really means in environmental sustainability.

01:39.340 --> 01:46.180
And so we started to create a huge list, an awesome list, I think you know what this is,

01:46.180 --> 01:50.140
it actually lists all projects that we can find in this domain.

01:50.140 --> 01:57.140
And quite soon I really joined this project because she did a similar development four

01:57.140 --> 02:04.860
years ago and we were thinking about, okay, we created now this huge list and let's make

02:04.860 --> 02:13.500
a study about this, how can we quantify and how can we also find quantitative ways to

02:13.500 --> 02:20.340
investigate what actually open source means in environmental sustainability.

02:20.340 --> 02:30.380
So I really was actually funded by SUBAC that is Accelerator Program to open up data in

02:30.380 --> 02:32.940
climate.

02:32.940 --> 02:37.540
And after that Josh Hopkins from Open Corridor joined us.

02:37.540 --> 02:45.180
He is interested to integrate multiple of the projects we investigated in a larger software

02:45.180 --> 02:50.580
project also for environmental sustainability.

02:50.580 --> 02:54.420
So what does environmental sustainability in general means?

02:54.420 --> 03:03.300
It is actually the goal to preserve the natural resources that we all depend on for future

03:03.300 --> 03:05.380
generations.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.380
But what does it actually require?

03:08.380 --> 03:14.420
So it requires the intelligent intention to understand, predict and manage the stability

03:14.420 --> 03:16.620
of our natural resources.

03:16.620 --> 03:21.220
And that means that you need to understand that actually we depend on nature and the

03:21.220 --> 03:29.820
natural resources that have been created over a million of years by the nature itself and

03:29.820 --> 03:36.620
the natural earth systems that we see here.

03:36.620 --> 03:43.060
For example, you see on the right hand side an atmospheric simulation by the open source

03:43.060 --> 03:44.780
project called SCREAM.

03:44.780 --> 03:50.740
They are investigating how does the content of water vapor change and how does water vapor

03:50.740 --> 03:55.900
actually change the climate in the future when our earth is heating up.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.340
Because when the earth is heating up more water vapor will be in the atmosphere.

04:00.340 --> 04:09.180
And this is a huge problem because it actually accelerates climate itself because water vapor

04:09.180 --> 04:10.900
is itself a greenhouse gas.

04:10.900 --> 04:17.780
So we see there an actually accelerating process and software is there very important to actually

04:17.780 --> 04:26.380
predict and to understand how this will be in the future.

04:26.380 --> 04:33.780
So the core question of the study and analysis that we did is what enables open source software

04:33.780 --> 04:36.420
and environmental sustainability.

04:36.420 --> 04:44.060
So I think you know that open source is now dominating all software industries worldwide.

04:44.060 --> 04:51.260
And there are studies from synopsis that shows that actually in 79% of the code bases worldwide

04:51.260 --> 04:53.300
you can find open source code.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.780
And they did it because they do security auditing.

04:56.780 --> 05:01.660
And they look into the code and they see okay we find it everywhere and it impacts all our

05:01.660 --> 05:05.060
software that we depend on worldwide.

05:05.060 --> 05:09.780
So what we did in our study is we started with the state.

05:09.780 --> 05:14.540
So what is actually the state of this ecosystem?

05:14.540 --> 05:21.620
And we created multiple insights but we also wanted to derive some principles based on

05:21.620 --> 05:28.780
the multiple projects we investigated and interviews and people we talked to.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.700
But we also wanted to create some visions.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.140
So what are actually opportunities?

05:33.140 --> 05:34.180
What are strategies?

05:34.180 --> 05:41.980
What is the potential that we are missing that actually open source delivers us in environmental

05:41.980 --> 05:46.620
sustainability?

05:46.620 --> 05:55.900
So let's have a look about what are applications of environmental sustainability in open source.

05:55.900 --> 05:59.980
And one very important aspect there is the environmental intelligence.

05:59.980 --> 06:08.940
So you get satellite data all around the world from multiple satellites, from another satellites,

06:08.940 --> 06:10.180
from either satellites.

06:10.180 --> 06:15.740
And most of this especially satellite data that deals with the environment, that is really

06:15.740 --> 06:19.820
looking at the environment is actually open to the public.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.820
And you can process it.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.340
There is a lot of open source tools.

06:23.340 --> 06:32.500
And with this multi-spectra and also with images and with the high spatial resolution

06:32.500 --> 06:38.380
and temporal resolution of those satellites, you can derive multiple aspects of our environment

06:38.380 --> 06:45.900
like the air quality but also how our forest changed and also how noise actually is changing

06:45.900 --> 06:48.220
with our cities.

06:48.220 --> 06:52.740
You can measure but also and that's very important point source emissions.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.940
That means who is actually creating emissions.

06:54.940 --> 06:56.140
And you can directly point it.

06:56.140 --> 06:59.540
This is the company who creates this amount of emissions.

06:59.540 --> 07:08.300
And this is getting more and more an important topic because we have now multiple aspects

07:08.300 --> 07:15.420
that are coming like CO2, taxes and carbon trading where we actually need traceable data

07:15.420 --> 07:19.820
about what is the amount of emissions somebody created.

07:19.820 --> 07:24.620
But on the other side there's also things like biodiversity that you can measure.

07:24.620 --> 07:31.380
Like satellites create images with not just RGB but they have a huge amount of different

07:31.380 --> 07:32.820
colors that they measure.

07:32.820 --> 07:40.020
And if you combine those colors you can actually derive the change of biodiversity of forest

07:40.020 --> 07:45.140
or any living being on the planet.

07:45.140 --> 07:47.860
Another important topic is also the urban vegetation.

07:47.860 --> 07:52.420
So how do we lose our urban vegetation?

07:52.420 --> 07:57.260
And in combination with the heat islands because where we lose our urban vegetation you have

07:57.260 --> 08:09.580
at the same time so it means with climate change it will get very hot in these areas.

08:09.580 --> 08:17.300
But there's also the application directly in our real world technology that we're seeing.

08:17.300 --> 08:25.340
And we found very amazing projects like a complete 50 megawatt wind turbine that was

08:25.340 --> 08:28.020
being released open source.

08:28.020 --> 08:33.920
So that means there's the blueprints, how to build this wind turbine, there's the simulation.

08:33.920 --> 08:38.780
So all the software that actually is needed to design this wind turbine has been open

08:38.780 --> 08:48.060
sourced and in combination with multiple American and European organizations.

08:48.060 --> 08:55.780
But you will also find interesting software libraries that help you to predict where do

08:55.780 --> 09:02.260
you place your photovoltaic and what is the perfect orientation of your photovoltaic in

09:02.260 --> 09:10.980
relation to the sun so that you have the most efficient of those solar panels.

09:10.980 --> 09:15.980
But and there was also a talk about PIPESAR yesterday.

09:15.980 --> 09:23.780
We have now with open source, we have now a complete simulation of the world energy

09:23.780 --> 09:33.820
grid and all those energy systems that are within this huge network of different power

09:33.820 --> 09:35.780
plants but also of the renewables.

09:35.780 --> 09:45.580
And you see here, for example, the power grid of India, how it was simulated with PIPESAR.

09:45.580 --> 09:54.540
So what we actually did is a methodology that from my analysis, nobody did before in open

09:54.540 --> 09:56.180
source in general.

09:56.180 --> 10:03.740
So the first thing we did is we compiled this list and it took me two years and I think

10:03.740 --> 10:10.540
more than 500 hours to investigate all those projects worldwide and we used multiple ways

10:10.540 --> 10:21.140
how to do it and you find it in the study and report that we released some weeks ago.

10:21.140 --> 10:29.100
It was a combination of researching on GitHub, GitLab, searching on different papers, doing

10:29.100 --> 10:35.620
data mining but we also just looked on the stars of different people on GitHub.

10:35.620 --> 10:41.580
So what are the people starring that are working in environmental sustainability?

10:41.580 --> 10:45.060
So this was a huge effort but also the community helped us a lot.

10:45.060 --> 10:53.100
So we had more than 30 volunteers that contributed to the list and helped us to curate this list.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.900
And we really were focusing on projects that were aiming on environmental sustainability

10:57.900 --> 11:01.300
at their core.

11:01.300 --> 11:07.980
And the core idea was to keep the list in a way that it is possible.

11:07.980 --> 11:15.380
So we really tried to list GitHub projects because it, and also GitLab projects are every

11:15.380 --> 11:24.420
kind of repository where people can participate into.

11:24.420 --> 11:32.980
So first step was creating the list and after that we created some scripts to automatically

11:32.980 --> 11:41.540
gather the metadata of all those projects and we created some targeted interviews with

11:41.540 --> 11:44.060
all those domains we investigated.

11:44.060 --> 11:47.420
And the domains actually were derived within the study.

11:47.420 --> 11:56.140
So this is our perspective on this ecosystem and the naming that we use there.

11:56.140 --> 12:00.740
You see here in the middle that's actually the core project open sustainable technology

12:00.740 --> 12:06.020
and around this are the fields and within the fields are different topics that we put

12:06.020 --> 12:08.100
the projects into.

12:08.100 --> 12:13.660
And after that we did a cooperative report and cross-validated actually the qualitative

12:13.660 --> 12:26.780
and quantitative insights that we derived from this investigation.

12:26.780 --> 12:31.020
So here's the overview of the dataset.

12:31.020 --> 12:37.180
And you can see we have in total 1,339 projects.

12:37.180 --> 12:39.100
This was quite some work.

12:39.100 --> 12:44.820
And most of them were actually GitHub projects, some were GitLab projects.

12:44.820 --> 12:52.460
And I must say actually the numbers here are all dealing with the GitHub projects.

12:52.460 --> 12:58.100
We could not integrate so far the GitLab API into the study.

12:58.100 --> 13:04.140
I hope to do this in further studies and also to integrate other platforms.

13:04.140 --> 13:10.540
But to keep it simple, the first study was really focusing on GitHub.

13:10.540 --> 13:15.300
And actually on GitHub we also found most projects.

13:15.300 --> 13:19.340
You see here also that we list here the active project.

13:19.340 --> 13:26.740
So within the study we tried only to list projects that had one closed issue in the

13:26.740 --> 13:35.980
last year that one commit and that are documented and have a certain kind of quality.

13:35.980 --> 13:40.260
So we did a small quality analysis of the project.

13:40.260 --> 13:42.140
Is there some documentation?

13:42.140 --> 13:47.060
Can people actually build the software by their own and use this in their own projects?

13:47.060 --> 13:50.060
This was very important within the investigation.

13:50.060 --> 13:55.260
And yeah, you can see here we derived the total number of stars and the total number

13:55.260 --> 14:00.140
of contributors but also other quantities to just show, give you an impression about

14:00.140 --> 14:11.380
how is the ecosystem in itself, how in this direction does it go.

14:11.380 --> 14:14.500
What you can also see is that we list here some inactive projects.

14:14.500 --> 14:18.140
So actually this was the hard part of the study.

14:18.140 --> 14:23.020
As you maybe know, most open source projects die very soon.

14:23.020 --> 14:30.380
So within the project actually 192 projects actually got inactive.

14:30.380 --> 14:35.460
And this was also my impression when we do this analysis, most projects were really inactive.

14:35.460 --> 14:40.100
I have no clear numbers but I think it's more than 90% of the projects we investigated were

14:40.100 --> 14:41.100
inactive.

14:41.100 --> 14:46.700
They were just academia projects where somebody released the paper and then it's just over.

14:46.700 --> 14:47.700
That's it.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.300
It's like throwing an open source project to the wall and hope somebody maybe can use

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
it.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.140
But this is not where we want to focus on.

14:54.140 --> 14:58.940
We really wanted to focus on a project that you can use and that you can reintegrate into

14:58.940 --> 15:04.380
newer projects.

15:04.380 --> 15:11.420
So the first thing that I realized when doing this investigation is there's quite a low

15:11.420 --> 15:14.860
popularity in environmental sustainability.

15:14.860 --> 15:21.660
So even if it is a hot topic and you see it multiple times in the media and everybody

15:21.660 --> 15:32.380
is talking about it and yeah, it sounds very trendy, we could just find free projects that

15:32.380 --> 15:35.820
have more than 1,000 stars.

15:35.820 --> 15:47.980
And in total on GitHub you find 38,000 projects that have more than 1,000 stars.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.820
So it's just and that's also what's my impression.

15:50.820 --> 15:57.980
So most people are really not appreciating those climate models or, for example, those

15:57.980 --> 16:04.700
biodiversity models that have been created and that are actually being maintained by

16:04.700 --> 16:07.580
different organizations worldwide.

16:07.580 --> 16:16.500
So on the left-hand side you see actually the color bar that is community health index

16:16.500 --> 16:17.980
that we created.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.020
It's called the development distribution score.

16:21.020 --> 16:27.780
And we realized that actually the most important aspect of an open source project is how much

16:27.780 --> 16:33.540
is the knowledge and the development distributed within the project itself.

16:33.540 --> 16:39.060
So we created just a very small number by the comment that is just we take the number,

16:39.060 --> 16:44.780
the comments of the strongest contributor and divide it by the total comments.

16:44.780 --> 16:51.420
And you get an impression how much does this project actually depend on one developer or

16:51.420 --> 16:54.300
is there actually very community behind it.

16:54.300 --> 17:01.780
And you see the A-B street that is the most popular project is really one man show that's

17:01.780 --> 17:12.340
actually a project where somebody's tried to do a gamification of cities to improve

17:12.340 --> 17:18.340
our transport system to do it more sustainable.

17:18.340 --> 17:23.180
After that it's a very famous project and also it is a for-profit open source project

17:23.180 --> 17:25.660
that is called electricity map.

17:25.660 --> 17:35.940
And after that you see project like open farm or the SCA fund that is actually a green software

17:35.940 --> 17:36.940
project.

17:36.940 --> 17:43.340
And how dealing with different kinds of aspects, how do we investigate and create knowledge

17:43.340 --> 17:52.140
about our environment and how can we improve our society so that we create less impact

17:52.140 --> 17:56.700
on our ecosystem, let's say negative impact.

17:56.700 --> 18:02.020
But you see also there some in popularity some climate models like or let's say earth

18:02.020 --> 18:11.380
science models and frameworks like Pangeo and it's or very models that are actually

18:11.380 --> 18:15.780
also very important like the WRF.

18:15.780 --> 18:20.340
So on the right hand side you see the contributors.

18:20.340 --> 18:24.820
So the total numbers of contributors that we could find within a project and electricity

18:24.820 --> 18:29.240
map there is again the let's say dominant project.

18:29.240 --> 18:40.740
And electricity map is actually a they combine the so-called carbon intensity of all different

18:40.740 --> 18:46.400
electric grids worldwide to give you an impression or give you a number about when I'm consuming

18:46.400 --> 18:54.540
this amount of electricity at this point on the earth how much carbon do I actually release

18:54.540 --> 19:00.900
to the atmosphere by this power consumption.

19:00.900 --> 19:08.140
And this is really let's say one of the very few larger communities that we could found

19:08.140 --> 19:13.860
where a lot of academic and for profits and different organizations were coming together

19:13.860 --> 19:17.900
to create this.

19:17.900 --> 19:23.100
Another project is actually the open food network where people try to create trustable

19:23.100 --> 19:34.060
knowledge and information about how what what is the information of food itself so that

19:34.060 --> 19:36.300
you can have trustworthy information.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.660
And this is also a huge community project quite all.

19:38.660 --> 19:45.460
And you can also see here the screen project very larger atmospheric project.

19:45.460 --> 19:49.660
But in general you see the total numbers of contributors if you compare it with our open

19:49.660 --> 19:56.180
source projects are quite low it's not that big.

19:56.180 --> 20:07.560
And for me personally actually the so this project itself has 1300 stars so we are actually

20:07.560 --> 20:12.020
one of the most popular open source projects in the never meant sustainability and this

20:12.020 --> 20:16.540
is not a good sign but because I'm just we are just some random dudes.

20:16.540 --> 20:21.180
We are we are actually we have no foundation we are just a community and people were coming

20:21.180 --> 20:25.500
together you know and that's what I wanted to show with this slide.

20:25.500 --> 20:33.740
So within the open source community there's a lack for it of popularity in environmental

20:33.740 --> 20:38.240
sustainability.

20:38.240 --> 20:45.780
So if you look at the license and language of projects we see there's a lot of MIT license

20:45.780 --> 20:54.060
actually so it's actually easy to integrate those projects into for profit not that hard.

20:54.060 --> 21:02.960
But there's also let's say a good portion of free open source license like GPL 3.0.

21:02.960 --> 21:11.700
But what we also could find is that with the data analysis we could not always really invest

21:11.700 --> 21:15.860
automatically investigate what is actually the license of the project.

21:15.860 --> 21:21.540
So that's the custom license and this is always problematic so if you release open source

21:21.540 --> 21:25.740
code use a standard license that people know about.

21:25.740 --> 21:31.940
They don't need a lawyer to actually see if they can actually reintegrate the software

21:31.940 --> 21:37.580
into maybe a commercial project because we want to and we need to go with such approaches

21:37.580 --> 21:44.780
into commercial projects if we don't commercialize environmental sustainability we will never

21:44.780 --> 21:49.460
achieve environmental sustainability.

21:49.460 --> 21:56.700
On the right hand side you see the proportions of the programming languages and here we can

21:56.700 --> 22:04.940
see that actually data analysis and data driven languages are really on the top.

22:04.940 --> 22:15.180
I can imagine that you expect Python here but also R is here very prominent because

22:15.180 --> 22:20.540
in environmental sustainability it's a lot of about statistics and processing a lot of

22:20.540 --> 22:28.420
data but we can also find here Fortran and C++ and those languages are used in the large

22:28.420 --> 22:37.140
scale simulation of our earth so if you want to really be efficient in your calculations

22:37.140 --> 22:42.300
that's the programming languages that you use and the high portion actually of Fortran

22:42.300 --> 22:47.020
shows us that many of those software projects are quite old.

22:47.020 --> 22:55.900
This is really sometimes coded as 20, 30 years old where our earth and our atmosphere, biosphere,

22:55.900 --> 23:02.780
hydrosphere has been simulated and this code has been reintegrated into new software projects.

23:02.780 --> 23:15.900
Yeah, another, JavaScript is here not that important so but that's what we also did is

23:15.900 --> 23:23.860
from the we actually derived from the projects all the organizations behind it so what is

23:23.860 --> 23:30.540
actually the namespaces of the projects and from the namespaces of the projects we had

23:30.540 --> 23:36.520
a little bit smaller list and this was actually hand labeled so we went through all those

23:36.520 --> 23:47.600
organizations and created actually the location but also the continent of those organizations

23:47.600 --> 23:54.780
and we see there's let's say Europe has quite a good standing here and also North America

23:54.780 --> 23:58.320
we found a lot of project that considered themselves for organizations that considered

23:58.320 --> 24:06.180
themselves as global so but unfortunately I have to say actually from Asia and I did

24:06.180 --> 24:12.380
a lot of investigations I could not find a lot of open source projects that actually

24:12.380 --> 24:17.540
originate from the Asian continent whereas there really an organization behind it.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.940
It doesn't mean that there are not people involved into this.

24:19.940 --> 24:25.260
I just wanted to say that we could not find it and I did there are a lot of research on

24:25.260 --> 24:26.260
this.

24:26.260 --> 24:37.060
Yes, what we also did is we labeled the forms of organizations behind it so and it was surprising

24:37.060 --> 24:44.460
for me that actually the community based projects like we are the strongest so community we

24:44.460 --> 24:49.880
labeled when there was no legal structure behind it just some people coming together

24:49.880 --> 24:53.180
doing stuff.

24:53.180 --> 24:59.300
This was considered community and after that academia has a very important role there because

24:59.300 --> 25:05.300
they did a lot of this research investigations in our environmental sustainability but also

25:05.300 --> 25:10.300
government agency are very important in this domain.

25:10.300 --> 25:19.620
Unfortunately I have to also to say for profits and that's a general trend are not that prominent.

25:19.620 --> 25:30.140
We did I did a lot of investigations into the kind of do we find actually commercialized

25:30.140 --> 25:35.220
or for profit applications of this kind of software and I told you about electricity

25:35.220 --> 25:41.500
map that's maybe let's say the most one really successful project that we can find but besides

25:41.500 --> 25:46.460
that there's Microsoft is actually doing some good open source project in the environment

25:46.460 --> 25:53.860
sustainability like the planetary compute framework and so there's some other good developments

25:53.860 --> 26:01.340
but compared to the problem that we are dealing with this is a little bit disappointing.

26:01.340 --> 26:06.940
So it cannot be that this is just been an academia community thing with some maybe some

26:06.940 --> 26:12.020
government agencies so there needs to be more for profit organizations and I think we see

26:12.020 --> 26:16.820
this also now with commercial open source software is becoming more and more important

26:16.820 --> 26:22.380
and there's really no billions of dollars going in this kind of development but we're

26:22.380 --> 26:30.900
missing there totally in this domain.

26:30.900 --> 26:40.700
So you can see here this is all project that we mapped scattered over the project age you

26:40.700 --> 26:47.260
see here the topics and they are actually ordered we also created a size score so that

26:47.260 --> 26:52.700
we can order them see the strongest was actually a biosphere but this was also because we not

26:52.700 --> 26:59.780
separated actually biosphere so strongly if you would combine climate data processing

26:59.780 --> 27:05.500
and the climate models actually climate science I would say it in general would be the most

27:05.500 --> 27:14.060
strongest area but also what was quite interesting is that actually hydrosphere so the people

27:14.060 --> 27:19.340
dealing with our water resources they were also very strong we could find a lot of strong

27:19.340 --> 27:26.580
projects there it's all the same for soil it's about air quality it's about agriculture

27:26.580 --> 27:31.580
and nutrition so really that what is really describing the state of our environment there

27:31.580 --> 27:35.420
we know a lot there's a lot of information about what is actually the state where we

27:35.420 --> 27:42.580
are going but if you go more into let's say the technology area if it's if you're talking

27:42.580 --> 27:49.060
about batteries if you're talking about hydrogen bioenergy carbon capture and removal there

27:49.060 --> 27:57.220
it was super hard to find good projects that we could list and also most surprisingly for

27:57.220 --> 28:03.220
me in the area of sustainable investment because sustainable investment is really something

28:03.220 --> 28:08.300
that is started with and there's a lot of huge companies behind it that gather information

28:08.300 --> 28:16.300
that a lot of they have a lot of models and ways how to consider what is actually sustainable

28:16.300 --> 28:23.740
in our investment and there was actually two or three really strong projects but they were

28:23.740 --> 28:27.620
also at the beginning and compared to the problem we are facing this was also a little

28:27.620 --> 28:37.260
bit disappointing other areas like also carbon capture and carbon offsets were also not that

28:37.260 --> 28:45.820
prominent and I would say if you're more interested in the quantities that we created we created

28:45.820 --> 28:51.060
much more about the growth about different kinds of communities and we created a lot

28:51.060 --> 28:56.060
of quantities and plots for you you'll find us in the report so I would stop here to talk

28:56.060 --> 29:03.500
actually about let's say the quantitative analysis and go more into the ins into the

29:03.500 --> 29:08.140
suggestions into the recommendations that we derived from our analysis and from the

29:08.140 --> 29:14.340
interviews and from the people that we talked to and also I must say the discussions we

29:14.340 --> 29:26.460
had within the group lead to a lot of interesting aspects and recommendations so sustainable

29:26.460 --> 29:34.100
rating investment is really getting a huge and important topic and it influenced all of you

29:34.100 --> 29:43.340
because this is where actually your future is going into that means there's actually

29:43.340 --> 29:51.460
the United Nations principles for responsible investment this was created you see here 2006

29:51.460 --> 29:59.500
and decorated some really baseline for what and how do we actually do sustainable investment

29:59.500 --> 30:08.580
and you see here that actually in 2021 we are not talking about 100 around 140 trillions

30:08.580 --> 30:15.940
of dollars that are invested based on those principles so there's a huge amount of money

30:15.940 --> 30:20.540
going in this direction that needs to be because we actually want to transform our economy

30:20.540 --> 30:34.700
to a let's say sustainable system so the problem is that how I was very interested in this

30:34.700 --> 30:40.420
domain and I did a lot of investigations I talked to people about this and we analyzed

30:40.420 --> 30:47.060
how this is done so how it's actually sustainable rating and assessment being done and actually

30:47.060 --> 30:52.980
it is a big black box to summarize it you have some sustainability reports that are

30:52.980 --> 31:01.140
actually self reported by the companies and then are there's a lot of news about sustainability

31:01.140 --> 31:06.740
of companies and a lot of marketing that you know and this is actually being combined and

31:06.740 --> 31:10.740
so-called sustainability assessment and there are multiple companies that are doing this

31:10.740 --> 31:16.940
and there's really not so much known about really how this goes and you see here also

31:16.940 --> 31:21.820
how actually greenwashing works it's very easy you create very beautiful reports that

31:21.820 --> 31:29.580
really look very good nobody's really trace it's really assessing if if they are really

31:29.580 --> 31:35.540
based on science it's really that you do self reporting about your environment sustainability

31:35.540 --> 31:41.420
and then this sustainability assessments also take into account news about those companies

31:41.420 --> 31:46.260
actually so how is there good news about the environmental impact of those companies or

31:46.260 --> 31:50.820
bad news and they also take a financial news about those companies and this is always being

31:50.820 --> 31:58.780
combined in sustainable sustainability assessment and then there comes a magic number and based

31:58.780 --> 32:06.380
on those numbers 140 trillion of dollars are invested somewhere okay that's crazy from

32:06.380 --> 32:15.660
my perspective and I digged it a little bit into this and I realized oh there's a lot

32:15.660 --> 32:20.900
of scientists that realize that actually this is like throwing the dice what this rating

32:20.900 --> 32:27.740
companies are actually doing you see here on the bottom that's actually the value of

32:27.740 --> 32:32.020
the benchmark rating from one company called system analytics and then you see here the

32:32.020 --> 32:39.900
divergence of this ratings and if there would be an ideal world this would be one line okay

32:39.900 --> 32:47.700
they would all agree on environmental sustainability but and actually they do not agree so you

32:47.700 --> 32:52.140
just have to go to the right rating agency and you can make every company actually sustainable

32:52.140 --> 33:01.700
today very easily been done and you also have to see that actually the rating itself has some so

33:01.700 --> 33:08.500
you don't get normally the very bad rating or a very good rating right so in general it is you

33:08.500 --> 33:14.620
just have to throw the dice and also the offer saying addressing ESG rating that means environmental

33:14.620 --> 33:18.260
social governments because this is actually a little bit a combination of different kinds of

33:18.260 --> 33:24.780
ratings they do environmental but also a social sustainability rating and governments rating

33:24.780 --> 33:32.860
the word is requires addressing is derating divergence requires one to understand how the

33:32.860 --> 33:40.660
data that underpins ESG ratings are generated so nobody knows how this data is generated and

33:40.660 --> 33:46.460
I think you know already the solution so when nobody knows our data is generated and we have

33:46.460 --> 33:56.420
a big black box yeah then you normally take open source but it is not happening because people are

33:56.420 --> 34:02.340
also doing the same thing in the so-called carbon offset so if your company is actually creating a

34:02.340 --> 34:08.500
lot of emissions and you want to be carbon neutral and you see this labeled all over the place now

34:08.500 --> 34:15.660
everybody's carbon neutral and it's great that they all actually want to be carbon neutral but

34:15.660 --> 34:22.780
there's actually study being done by the Guardian and they investigated how much of those carbon

34:22.780 --> 34:29.500
that is actually released in the atmosphere is actually been stored back into our soil and into

34:29.500 --> 34:35.780
our ground and you see this on the right hand side is actually the carbon cycle that is driving the

34:35.780 --> 34:42.300
co2 into the atmosphere it is actually a natural let's say there's a natural cycle that actually

34:42.300 --> 34:54.140
is going on and this the cycle was created by actually it took millions of years to stabilize

34:54.140 --> 34:59.860
our atmosphere by this carbon cycle so that we have a low portion of carbon with no atmosphere

34:59.860 --> 35:06.240
and this way a stable weather and stable climate and a predictable earth systems that we all can

35:06.240 --> 35:13.980
depend on but yeah the Guardian found out that the real emissions that are actually stored in

35:13.980 --> 35:24.100
the ground are much lower than actually what they are claiming for so actually they say that over 90%

35:24.100 --> 35:33.860
of those carbon offsets people are claiming for actually claims that's what the Guardians is saying

35:33.860 --> 35:39.620
here but you see another problem Guardian is just showing you a plot and that's actually the core

35:39.620 --> 35:45.860
problem of all of this they just at the end show you a plot and then believe my plot I did great

35:45.860 --> 35:54.980
science behind it just trust my science and that's let's say the core problem I want to

35:54.980 --> 36:01.020
investigate with you a little bit more so because we're talking about here about safety critical

36:01.020 --> 36:08.700
decision-making the we know exactly and I showed you this also with the topics and with the numbers

36:08.700 --> 36:15.620
of people that are investigating we know very good with open science that is traceable for all of you

36:15.620 --> 36:23.060
you can go into this climate models and they're very good examples for in simple Python you can

36:23.060 --> 36:33.700
but you will also find larger climate science and projects that you can just run on your machine and

36:33.700 --> 36:41.460
they all come to the same result that we are actually on a very bad path on with colliding

36:41.460 --> 36:49.020
with the earth actually and this is very clear to us so there's no doubt so if you if you don't

36:49.020 --> 36:55.780
trust into climate science just go into the repositories create an issue or deal with the

36:55.780 --> 37:04.100
software that you find there so opens the problem that we are facing now is that the decision-making

37:04.100 --> 37:10.500
the assessment of sustainable and sustainable investment there we have no clue what we actually

37:10.500 --> 37:21.140
do and there's no open source software and not much open source software that we could really find so

37:21.140 --> 37:29.620
but there's help and especially in the energy sector we found a lot of good projects that that

37:29.620 --> 37:36.140
really understand how to get rid of those problem of traceability because when somebody just is

37:36.140 --> 37:45.140
showing you a plot I think hydrogen will be the future of energy of the energy sector and there

37:45.140 --> 37:50.340
comes somebody else and shows you another plot this cannot really come you cannot really create a

37:50.340 --> 37:56.420
discussion about this and this is really everybody needs to be at least able to discuss about this

37:56.420 --> 38:04.460
right and what they did in in actually in the energy modeling so the this pipes our project

38:04.460 --> 38:09.620
actually I showed you at the beginning they release those models and in this way you can create

38:09.620 --> 38:19.460
proof and show hey I calculated this if you don't agree with me show me your model and if you don't

38:19.460 --> 38:29.260
show me your model I don't trust you that's that's how it goes and this is really let's say a very

38:29.260 --> 38:42.260
important idea that I found here it's that you you need to understand that you can actually prove

38:42.260 --> 38:49.100
how much conclusion has actually been open and traceable you just have to see how much open data

38:49.100 --> 38:55.380
is there and is there uncertainty is actually also in the data that is comes with the data is there

38:55.380 --> 39:02.020
open source models are there is there actually an open execution possible of those models do you

39:02.020 --> 39:07.460
find open results of those executions so it's the artifacts actually create by its simulation is

39:07.460 --> 39:12.220
this actually also open source is there a way to participate can you go into the guitar

39:12.220 --> 39:17.580
repository can you go into a conference and ask the question how you had has he done this and is

39:17.580 --> 39:24.660
this conclusion with uncertainties at the end so is there a plot that shows what is actually my

39:24.660 --> 39:30.780
unknown my uncertainty what or is it just a single number and if it's just a single number

39:30.780 --> 39:39.540
it's a problem and we can propagate the uncertainty is through such a thing and that's very important

39:39.540 --> 39:49.580
for traceability then what we found out that actually openness itself and that's let's say

39:49.580 --> 39:58.420
one of the core findings of the whole study is the indicator for sustainability itself so if you

39:58.420 --> 40:04.500
want to know and it's very important to understand we sometimes don't know today what is actually

40:04.500 --> 40:11.860
sustainable but if there comes somebody and says I personally don't know if I'm really sustainable

40:11.860 --> 40:18.620
but I show you how I calculated why I think I am sustainable this show sustainable intention

40:18.620 --> 40:26.420
and this is what we need today because then you can go into and discussion you can go with people

40:26.420 --> 40:35.100
into some maintenance of code you can improve your own code and that's why actually openness

40:35.100 --> 40:42.300
itself is the core and it's really the key indicator for sustainability itself you see also

40:42.300 --> 40:49.700
despite a picture this was chose the standing on the shores of giants but from my perspective

40:49.700 --> 40:54.900
really describes very good open source in open source or let's say the technology that we built

40:54.900 --> 41:01.780
that is this blind giant and we are standing on the shoulder but we can see father by the giant

41:01.780 --> 41:08.900
but you cannot but the giant itself is blind but we can see much much farther and we can and the

41:08.900 --> 41:13.860
giants get bigger and bigger and we can see and predict the future in a much better way and that's

41:13.860 --> 41:18.420
why open source and actually the math and the models that we create there are so important to

41:18.420 --> 41:25.900
predict the future so one interesting aspect that I found to get rid of this problem is actually

41:25.900 --> 41:33.380
spatial finance it's the idea that we can use those whole earth observation data that we have to

41:33.380 --> 41:40.420
track down companies about their environmental sustainability so does all those software in

41:40.420 --> 41:46.900
earth observation all those open source software and there's a huge amount of open source software

41:46.900 --> 41:54.900
and earth observation can be used by rating agencies and all of us to actually track down

41:54.900 --> 42:00.700
companies on their environmental impact that's not that hard and there's actually an Oxford

42:00.700 --> 42:07.740
group that started the spatial finance and what they started with is they created a map of the

42:07.740 --> 42:15.380
whole fossil fuel industry where you know the whole supply chain so where are they located where is

42:15.380 --> 42:21.060
the fuel supply chain that helps you to on the one side simulate it but also to check satellite

42:21.060 --> 42:25.980
data and track down okay this company has a claim that they're actually sustainable let's have a

42:25.980 --> 42:35.460
look you have suddenly a sensor that is measuring the sustainability and that is needed so here's

42:35.460 --> 42:46.220
my let's say that's how I would actually improve the rating of environmental sustainability and

42:46.220 --> 42:54.060
how we can actually get rid of those problem is to actually integrate earth observation into this

42:54.060 --> 43:01.340
processing chain and very importantly where the assessment happens we need open source code and

43:01.340 --> 43:08.100
that's actually just one from the Linux Foundation one project that is starting to do this but this

43:08.100 --> 43:14.180
is really everything very early stage and then suddenly we can maybe in the future get sustainability

43:14.180 --> 43:21.260
ratings about companies that have some uncertainties but it would be also very great if companies

43:21.260 --> 43:27.380
itself would use open source code to do environmental sustainability rating within the company so for

43:27.380 --> 43:32.940
me personally I would like if ExxonMobil would say we would go open science now or every company

43:32.940 --> 43:37.660
that is goes open science about their own environmental sustainability had would have such a massive

43:37.660 --> 43:44.580
impact on the industry because finally you have the information and data to to to really measure

43:44.580 --> 43:53.580
sustainability within a company because so far this is all the black box for us so yeah I would

43:53.580 --> 43:59.780
like to say that open source is from my perspective the most underestimated climate strategy or climate

43:59.780 --> 44:09.820
action it is there's so much opportunity there that we created a whole list of recommendations

44:09.820 --> 44:17.140
how open source can have a significant impact so actually we were thinking about what could be

44:17.140 --> 44:23.380
follow-up projects and we had so many ideas about follow-up projects that we just were starting to

44:23.380 --> 44:29.820
list them all down as recommendation I think it are more than 50 no I just showed you two of them

44:29.820 --> 44:37.660
in combination actually so and yeah my final words would actually be and that's I think we need to

44:37.660 --> 44:44.820
understand we need to build an operating system for environmental sustainability it is for this

44:44.820 --> 44:53.820
for things like carbon offsets or the rating of the environmental impact of companies you need to

44:53.820 --> 45:00.580
connect all the spheres all those open source projects together to get one to bet get a better

45:00.580 --> 45:08.460
conclusion about what is the state of our environment and that's why and that's I hope

45:08.460 --> 45:14.220
and that's what we hope to start and hope to build in the future is really such kind of an

45:14.220 --> 45:43.220
operating system yeah thank you so much well thank you Tobias for your brain splurging

45:43.220 --> 45:51.380
presentation we have you can type your questions in matrix or you can just raise your hand and I

45:51.380 --> 46:15.620
will bring you the microphone oh gosh okay I lost you in the crowd hands again please

46:15.620 --> 46:25.660
inspiring presentation can you hear me and I absolutely agree that open source is very much

46:25.660 --> 46:36.500
underestimated as source of sustainability and a question can you suggest any ways how can developers

46:36.500 --> 46:45.420
collaborate better so for example I know that there are some gaps in climate modeling in bridging

46:45.420 --> 46:51.980
between climate modeling and energy modeling and it would be very helpful if energy modelers would

46:51.980 --> 46:58.980
know better about climate modelers and vice versa do you have any ideas can you suggest something

46:58.980 --> 47:07.980
to improve this situation can you hear me yeah I think what is really missing is the community

47:07.980 --> 47:13.980
behind it that is cross over the topics actually conference you need somewhere where these people

47:13.980 --> 47:20.380
meet and talk to each other that's what is missing and we realized and that's why we actually would

47:20.380 --> 47:27.340
and also the topic of environmental sustainability is always a side topic in open source conferences

47:27.340 --> 47:33.860
somewhere but we need a conference actually there that's the point where this this connection

47:33.860 --> 47:39.820
between the software projects is starting at the beer in the evening maybe where these people are

47:39.820 --> 47:44.300
connecting they are not really good connected with each other that's why this list is so successful

47:44.300 --> 47:58.100
they could not find each other to be as you mentioned that's a very low for-profit organizations

47:58.100 --> 48:07.380
currently yes but this if they increase we have also the lobbyists problem again because they are

48:07.380 --> 48:15.300
much more trained to get money for their already existing projects do you see some chance that

48:15.300 --> 48:26.260
new open source projects in this scope will also get paid contributors it death is also an opportunity

48:26.260 --> 48:32.740
yes it's not I'm not the biggest fan of commercial open source software I see there's some opportunities

48:32.740 --> 48:39.140
there are good ways bad ways depending on topic and a climate model should maybe not be in a

48:39.140 --> 48:45.340
for-profit but if it is maybe about the rating yeah there should be a company behind it so

48:45.340 --> 48:52.020
sometimes it really depends on the kind of project we are talking about so for example if you if you

48:52.020 --> 48:58.420
want to create a wind turbine right a wind turbine that is open source completely you need a company

48:58.420 --> 49:06.380
that maybe gives you 40 years of maintenance and it needs to be sure that this is maintenance and

49:06.380 --> 49:10.980
miss maybe this is better with a for-profit but depending on the project maybe on with a

49:10.980 --> 49:16.260
nonprofit it's not an easy question what is the right organization for an open source project

49:16.260 --> 49:29.420
it's very complicated
