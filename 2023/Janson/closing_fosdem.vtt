WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.440
So, that was a blast.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.500
And we are finally back in person.

00:11.500 --> 00:16.160
And also I'm going to take a picture because we are finally in person.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.880
Once again, if you leave, please be quiet because it is extremely loud up here.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.000
And no, you're not special enough that you should keep talking.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.480
Thank you very much.

00:29.480 --> 00:43.520
So it's a wrap.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.480
Random stats because stats are fun and easy to make.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.800
Sometimes it was a little bit of a rush.

00:49.800 --> 00:55.600
Our peak this time was 1.5 gigs in concurrent outgoing streams.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.600
Once again, please quiet if you decide to leave.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.840
Last year we had 1.65 gigabits peak and that was fully online.

01:03.840 --> 01:09.720
So that gives you a rough idea of how many people still chose to consume offsite even

01:09.720 --> 01:16.280
though we have a relatively full foster but not as packed as 2020 we think, we estimate.

01:16.280 --> 01:26.760
35 rooms, 800 concurrent viewers and roughly 20K unique viewers on the streams.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.320
We have a total of almost 400 hours of scheduled video for the ones tracking the numbers over

01:31.320 --> 01:36.360
the years that is less than the last two years because physical ULB has less space and less

01:36.360 --> 01:43.240
staff rooms than fully virtual but still we managed to fit quite some stuff in.

01:43.240 --> 01:49.320
We already have 53 released videos online and 21 are currently being reviewed and or

01:49.320 --> 01:54.760
transcoding for a total of almost one full day of video.

01:54.760 --> 02:00.760
Speaking of video, if you are a speaker or if you are a deaf room manager, please, please,

02:00.760 --> 02:03.920
please, please, please with sugar on top.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.280
You get those emails and you do what is in those emails and please help us review them

02:08.280 --> 02:13.560
because if you don't do it as a speaker, it falls on the deaf room managers to do it and

02:13.560 --> 02:18.640
if the deaf room managers don't do it, it falls on staff to do it and it's a lot of

02:18.640 --> 02:21.840
work and a lot of video because 400 hours of video is a lot.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.560
So please, if you are a speaker, if you are a deaf room manager, those emails are important.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.560
Do not ignore them.

02:26.560 --> 02:32.920
If you have any issues, email video at Fosdomorg and they come from no reply at Fosdomorg.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.040
Matrix also dropped because obviously a lot of people are in person but still we had quite

02:37.040 --> 02:43.440
some online participation slash online synchronisation while people were rocking the hallway track

02:43.440 --> 02:46.320
and attending talks and such.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.440
We sold out of Schwag.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.240
We weren't fully certain.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.000
We didn't know what we have a fully packed UOB, what we have almost nothing, anything

02:53.000 --> 02:56.960
in between but we managed to sell out so that's good.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.080
And we also had 130 advance orders.

02:59.080 --> 03:05.800
For those who don't know, we will continue to give you the ability to order Schwag beforehand

03:05.800 --> 03:09.360
which means you just get a voucher and you get a password and you get to front desk and

03:09.360 --> 03:10.440
you get it immediately.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.880
We don't have to do the payment, dance, everything.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.940
And also maybe depending on how the timeline works out, maybe we even can start ordering

03:17.940 --> 03:23.160
specifically for you as you do advance orders.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.600
There was a lot of food consumed.

03:24.600 --> 03:29.280
There's actually two slides.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.280
It's a lot.

03:32.280 --> 03:46.920
And it's not even a full number because this is as of 1530 local.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.520
Once again, thank you, it's really loud.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.880
Network we stopped checking Mac addresses for various reasons.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.920
Network was a little bit of a mess this year because a lot of things broke which we thought

03:57.920 --> 04:03.880
remotely were fine but the Macs concurrent we saw for IPv6 addresses being assigned was

04:03.880 --> 04:09.280
over 30K and the total amount which we gave out was 53K.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.880
People switched from one network to the other, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

04:11.880 --> 04:18.000
So it's not a fully scientific method and also privacy extensions which keep basically

04:18.000 --> 04:24.840
messing up all our stats but it's at least not a little.

04:24.840 --> 04:32.400
Also UAB has some traffic analysis on their controllers we don't for obvious privacy reasons.

04:32.400 --> 04:37.560
So you can guess what for the first time since they installed that stuff was the top website

04:37.560 --> 04:43.880
or the top site accessed by total volume of data going to and back.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
Any guesses?

04:44.880 --> 05:02.400
Obviously.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.080
We also had some stats.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.400
Initially we kept them at 2.5 but we switched from one gig to 10 gig over the weekend because

05:08.400 --> 05:10.480
that's how we rock.

05:10.480 --> 05:15.960
And we actually managed to consume more than the one gigabit which we had before.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.760
Going forward hopefully next year we will maybe even have two times 10 gig.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.560
We'll see.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.800
If you are and I keep telling people this every year if you are still using 2.4 gigahertz

05:27.800 --> 05:30.560
please don't.

05:30.560 --> 05:37.920
Get hardware which does 5G, 5 gigahertz, well 5G, no, 5 gigahertz, of course you will have

05:37.920 --> 05:38.920
less contention.

05:38.920 --> 05:43.040
You won't have zero contention but you will have less contention if you have hardware

05:43.040 --> 05:44.840
with 5 gigahertz.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.160
It's generally nicer so if you buy your next laptop your next would ever consider spending

05:49.160 --> 05:52.920
a little bit more money on 5 gigahertz.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.920
We come to thank yous.

05:53.920 --> 06:05.920
First of all the matrix and element people.

06:05.920 --> 06:10.080
Who asked to not be named just like so listed.

06:10.080 --> 06:19.720
Also Libera chat staff.

06:19.720 --> 06:31.080
And also sponsors without whose this wouldn't be possible.

06:31.080 --> 06:37.480
As per usual as I call out the next groups if you wear a colored T-shirt of the appropriate

06:37.480 --> 06:41.760
color, please come up front and take your applause.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.240
I'm not crying again.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
I'll see.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
All the volunteers.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
Come.

06:46.240 --> 07:02.040
All the volunteers.

07:02.040 --> 07:17.840
All the volunteers.

07:17.840 --> 07:44.600
I also see at least one green and one orange shirt which is not up front which is a big

07:44.600 --> 07:49.040
mistake.

07:49.040 --> 08:02.720
If you don't have the shirt on but you did volunteering,

08:02.720 --> 08:22.000
and whatever, please come up front.

08:22.000 --> 08:43.240
We have a few staff who are also supposed to come up front now.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
And thank you.

08:44.240 --> 09:01.200
As per always, please send feedback.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.800
We really rely on this feedback and we actually take it to heart.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.200
So please send any and all feedback which you have.

09:06.200 --> 09:12.360
We cannot always accommodate it but we read everything and we really do take it to heart.

09:12.360 --> 09:21.760
Thank you.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.240
That should be helping, not feedback, whatever.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.520
If you see trash, here, anywhere else.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.880
Congratulations, this is your trash now.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.120
And I'm being serious.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.820
It is an immense amount of work to build up in basically half a day on Friday and also

09:36.820 --> 09:40.620
to tear down within two to four hours on Sunday.

09:40.620 --> 09:45.160
So anything you see, please just take it with you, throw it in the trash, whatever, but

09:45.160 --> 09:47.200
please help us clean.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.920
Also speaking of cleaning, if you have some time, we would highly appreciate it if you

09:50.920 --> 09:53.960
just stayed around a little bit, helped us clean up.

09:53.960 --> 09:58.440
If you gather here, we will tell you what to do and it will take a little bit until

09:58.440 --> 10:00.220
we have all you segmented.

10:00.220 --> 10:06.560
But we can use every single hand for the network cabling which you tear out under guidance.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.080
You can keep the network cable.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.960
And also for the ones who stay until the very end and help until the very end, we will feed

10:12.960 --> 10:14.440
you in cabling at the end.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.520
So please consider just coming up front to help.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.280
Yes, after the thing, obviously.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.280
And that's it.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.680
So see you next year.

10:24.680 --> 10:39.000
And as is tradition.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.880
And as is tradition.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.320
So A, I forgot all the speakers who are in here.

10:43.320 --> 10:46.000
They also are supposed to be on stage if they so choose.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.560
So now is the time to come on stage if you want to.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.800
And as is tradition, we are ending Fostom with the Fostom dance.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.000
My knee is kind of broken.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.760
So I'm not going to lead the dance.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.240
Wouter is going to lead the dance.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.160
And with that, thank you.

11:02.160 --> 11:10.920
See you next year.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.440
I don't know who among you has done the Fostom dance before.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.480
It's actually quite difficult.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.680
But not really.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.760
We start like this.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.760
And it's difficult because you have to balance on one leg.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.920
But I'm sure you can all do that, right?

11:27.920 --> 11:34.960
So bear with me, and then we lift the one leg.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.080
And then we start moving.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.080
Everybody move.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.080
And we go faster.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.080
And there we go.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
We're dancing.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.080
Thank you.

11:44.080 --> 12:01.080
That was the official Fostom dance.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.080
Thank you.
