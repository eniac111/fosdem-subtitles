1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.020
Thank you very much for having me here at Fostem.

2
0:00:08.020 --> 0:00:14.100
This is my first Fostem and as part of the feedback from the organizers for my talk was

3
0:00:14.100 --> 0:00:19.900
it sounds like something that could be an upbeat, great way to end the meeting with

4
0:00:19.900 --> 0:00:24.340
lots of pretty pictures and I've done my best to fill this with lots of pretty pictures.

5
0:00:24.340 --> 0:00:27.940
And so hopefully I'll meet the expectations.

6
0:00:27.940 --> 0:00:29.260
I'm Steve Crawford.

7
0:00:29.260 --> 0:00:34.200
I'm the science data officer as part of the chief science data office of the science mission

8
0:00:34.200 --> 0:00:36.340
directorate of NASA.

9
0:00:36.340 --> 0:00:42.980
And I'm really excited here today to talk to you about NASA and open source software.

10
0:00:42.980 --> 0:00:48.000
And so just to give a little preview of what I'll be talking about, I'll start off with

11
0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:54.760
software and the importance of it to NASA, recent open source software success stories,

12
0:00:54.760 --> 0:01:02.000
challenges with open software, open source science, and then opportunities.

13
0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:07.260
And I think probably most everyone is familiar with NASA.

14
0:01:07.260 --> 0:01:15.300
But I want to share with you that NASA's vision is to reach new heights and reveal the unknown

15
0:01:15.300 --> 0:01:18.020
for the benefit of all humankind.

16
0:01:18.020 --> 0:01:21.480
And this image is I think a great encapsulation of this.

17
0:01:21.480 --> 0:01:24.540
Going to the moon was obviously reaching new heights.

18
0:01:24.540 --> 0:01:29.520
And this image of Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 mission landing on the moon.

19
0:01:29.520 --> 0:01:33.760
But it captures him actually in the act of a science experiment.

20
0:01:33.760 --> 0:01:39.120
They're actually capturing information about the solar winds on the surface of the moon

21
0:01:39.120 --> 0:01:43.320
and actually trying to better understand how our sun works and interacts with the different

22
0:01:43.320 --> 0:01:47.520
bodies and trying to actually explore heat of physics, which is one of the main areas

23
0:01:47.520 --> 0:01:49.620
we do research on.

24
0:01:49.620 --> 0:01:54.940
And so that is actually a key bit of NASA, not only to explore the universe and to explore

25
0:01:54.940 --> 0:01:59.400
our solar system and our atmosphere, but also to actually understand it.

26
0:01:59.400 --> 0:02:05.160
And so trying to actually understand for the benefit of everyone is a key part of NASA.

27
0:02:05.160 --> 0:02:13.060
And at the heart of that, an integral part of that and what makes NASA possible is software.

28
0:02:13.060 --> 0:02:18.720
Every mission, every bit of research that NASA does, there's software involved in it.

29
0:02:18.720 --> 0:02:20.960
And a great example is the Apollo software.

30
0:02:20.960 --> 0:02:26.880
And here's two of the people who are leaders and involved in it, Mary Jackson, who started

31
0:02:26.880 --> 0:02:33.880
work at the computers, the very early computers as part of NASA to actually work and then

32
0:02:33.880 --> 0:02:36.200
became one of the lead engineers.

33
0:02:36.200 --> 0:02:41.360
And Margaret Hamilton, who helped lead the team that was designing the control and command

34
0:02:41.360 --> 0:02:45.040
software for the Apollo 11 mission at MIT.

35
0:02:45.040 --> 0:02:49.120
And this software is actually released and made openly available.

36
0:02:49.120 --> 0:02:54.680
You can see an example of the scan of one of the early software.

37
0:02:54.680 --> 0:02:57.000
It's available online.

38
0:02:57.000 --> 0:02:58.680
It's also been converted to GitHub.

39
0:02:58.680 --> 0:03:02.160
If you actually want to actually take a look at the software and the code from the Apollo

40
0:03:02.160 --> 0:03:05.360
mission, it's there and available.

41
0:03:05.360 --> 0:03:10.560
Software has been a key part for all of our different missions, but NASA also has a long

42
0:03:10.560 --> 0:03:15.560
history of making the software openly available.

43
0:03:15.560 --> 0:03:22.120
And that sharing is part of NASA's DNA as part of the law that created NASA, the Space

44
0:03:22.120 --> 0:03:23.960
Act.

45
0:03:23.960 --> 0:03:29.360
In section 203, one of the aspects was to provide for the widest practical and appropriate

46
0:03:29.360 --> 0:03:34.600
dissemination of information concerning its activities and results thereof.

47
0:03:34.600 --> 0:03:43.160
Part of our congressionally mandated law is to actually share what we do and disseminate

48
0:03:43.160 --> 0:03:44.540
appropriately.

49
0:03:44.540 --> 0:03:49.400
We do always have to be concerned about security and keeping things safe, but we also want

50
0:03:49.400 --> 0:03:53.200
to actually share as much possible as we do.

51
0:03:53.200 --> 0:03:56.560
And today we're doing that through our different directories.

52
0:03:56.560 --> 0:04:02.740
We have our Exploration Systems Directorate with Artemis launching and aiming to go back

53
0:04:02.740 --> 0:04:05.560
to the moon and then Mars beyond it.

54
0:04:05.560 --> 0:04:09.320
We have our Space Operations Mission Directorate, which is actually focused on the International

55
0:04:09.320 --> 0:04:13.320
Space Station and about operations and living in space.

56
0:04:13.320 --> 0:04:16.920
We have our Science Mission Directorate, which I'm part of, which actually explores our universe

57
0:04:16.920 --> 0:04:18.800
and our Earth.

58
0:04:18.800 --> 0:04:22.160
And we also have our Space Technology and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, which

59
0:04:22.160 --> 0:04:27.300
actually are designing the technology that enable the exploration and discoveries made

60
0:04:27.300 --> 0:04:29.160
by the other directorates.

61
0:04:29.160 --> 0:04:32.760
I'm going to focus most of the rest of my talk on the Science Mission Directorate, but

62
0:04:32.760 --> 0:04:38.520
a lot of what I say for SMB also applies to these other activities.

63
0:04:38.520 --> 0:04:41.000
And so what does the Science Mission Directorate do?

64
0:04:41.000 --> 0:04:44.480
Well, it has three key science themes.

65
0:04:44.480 --> 0:04:50.680
These are to protect and improve life on Earth and space, search for life elsewhere, and

66
0:04:50.680 --> 0:04:57.720
that can be either within the solar system or planets circling around other stars, and

67
0:04:57.720 --> 0:05:00.200
remember the secrets of the universe.

68
0:05:00.200 --> 0:05:04.760
And so these are three, I think it's fair to say, pretty big questions that affect all

69
0:05:04.760 --> 0:05:06.760
of humanity.

70
0:05:06.760 --> 0:05:10.240
And that's what we're actually working at in the Science Mission Directorate to try and

71
0:05:10.240 --> 0:05:13.520
answer these questions.

72
0:05:13.520 --> 0:05:14.520
And how do we do that?

73
0:05:14.520 --> 0:05:17.200
Well, we do it through our fleet of missions.

74
0:05:17.200 --> 0:05:21.520
And so these are the different missions that the Science Mission Directorate have in orbit

75
0:05:21.520 --> 0:05:26.400
around the Earth, have in orbit around other planets or the sun, or have exploring the

76
0:05:26.400 --> 0:05:27.600
universe.

77
0:05:27.600 --> 0:05:30.600
And we have a wide range of Earth-observing satellites.

78
0:05:30.600 --> 0:05:36.400
We have a number of experiments going on on the International Space Station.

79
0:05:36.400 --> 0:05:41.880
We have a wide range of different explorers that have visited Mars.

80
0:05:41.880 --> 0:05:45.400
We also have observations of the sun.

81
0:05:45.400 --> 0:05:49.440
And we have our space telescopes and our space observatories observing the deepest reaches

82
0:05:49.440 --> 0:05:50.440
of the universe.

83
0:05:50.440 --> 0:05:55.280
And I just want to take a pause, though, as I take a look at and a very important aspect

84
0:05:55.280 --> 0:06:00.400
of this chart is that a lot of these missions, actually all of these missions, are done with

85
0:06:00.400 --> 0:06:01.560
our partners.

86
0:06:01.560 --> 0:06:06.920
NASA, even though NASA, everyone knows the NASA name and the NASA brand, so much of what

87
0:06:06.920 --> 0:06:09.280
NASA does is with others.

88
0:06:09.280 --> 0:06:10.840
It's with the community.

89
0:06:10.840 --> 0:06:15.240
We do it with our partners at the European Space Agency, at the Canadian Space Agency,

90
0:06:15.240 --> 0:06:16.420
at JAXA.

91
0:06:16.420 --> 0:06:21.400
We do it with the contractors and other agencies which are around the world that we partner

92
0:06:21.400 --> 0:06:22.440
with and work with.

93
0:06:22.440 --> 0:06:25.440
We also do it with the wider community.

94
0:06:25.440 --> 0:06:27.120
Some of these missions are NASA-led.

95
0:06:27.120 --> 0:06:30.360
Some are led by our partners.

96
0:06:30.360 --> 0:06:35.780
But really, I think there's actually one aspect which is actually very similar to open source

97
0:06:35.780 --> 0:06:42.360
where the missions and projects with NASA do take a very wide community in order to

98
0:06:42.360 --> 0:06:46.440
actually achieve these projects.

99
0:06:46.440 --> 0:06:51.520
And so I want to actually look at some of the success stories with these projects.

100
0:06:51.520 --> 0:06:53.760
And the first one I want to take a look at is Ingenuity.

101
0:06:53.760 --> 0:06:59.920
I'm going to play Ingenuity as part of the Mars Preseverance mission.

102
0:06:59.920 --> 0:07:03.240
Mars Preseverance is on the surface of Mars.

103
0:07:03.240 --> 0:07:10.200
It landed there in 2021 to explore Jezero Crater, an ancient delta on Mars.

104
0:07:10.200 --> 0:07:17.160
This was an area that was once rich with water and was sent there to actually explore whether

105
0:07:17.160 --> 0:07:19.780
or not the potential for life in that area.

106
0:07:19.780 --> 0:07:24.780
As part of that mission, there's a demonstrator on it, which is the Ingenuity drone copter.

107
0:07:24.780 --> 0:07:27.880
And you can see the first flight of it here.

108
0:07:27.880 --> 0:07:34.800
This is the first flight of a human-made object anywhere else in the solar system.

109
0:07:34.800 --> 0:07:39.320
And so we're actually flying a copter on another planet.

110
0:07:39.320 --> 0:07:48.200
Since the first flight, it's been repeated and has flown over 40 separate flights during

111
0:07:48.200 --> 0:07:49.200
the last two years.

112
0:07:49.200 --> 0:07:50.200
It's still flying.

113
0:07:50.200 --> 0:07:51.200
It's still exploring.

114
0:07:51.200 --> 0:07:53.560
This was something that was expected to make about five flights.

115
0:07:53.560 --> 0:07:56.400
And I'll just play that again.

116
0:07:56.400 --> 0:07:58.760
But it's driven by open source software.

117
0:07:58.760 --> 0:08:01.720
F Prime is the open source flight control software for this.

118
0:08:01.720 --> 0:08:05.920
And this framework was used for this project.

119
0:08:05.920 --> 0:08:09.440
It was released by JPL in 2017.

120
0:08:09.440 --> 0:08:14.720
And so this drone copter is flown by open source software.

121
0:08:14.720 --> 0:08:21.360
And one of the great things that happened to celebrate this accomplishment is that NASA

122
0:08:21.360 --> 0:08:27.560
and JPL partnered with GitHub to actually recognize all those who have contributed to

123
0:08:27.560 --> 0:08:28.560
this mission.

124
0:08:28.560 --> 0:08:33.480
And they didn't actually just to those who actually contributed to the F Prime repository.

125
0:08:33.480 --> 0:08:40.920
They also contributed and recognized all the others through a badge of the Mars 2020 helicopter

126
0:08:40.920 --> 0:08:49.720
badge, which recognized all the dependencies and all the other packages and software that

127
0:08:49.720 --> 0:08:54.240
was involved in and part of this project.

128
0:08:54.240 --> 0:08:58.960
And so this actually was over 12,000 people who contributed to these dependencies and

129
0:08:58.960 --> 0:09:02.680
these different packages which made this project possible.

130
0:09:02.680 --> 0:09:08.000
These contributors are from all around the world and have been contributing to open source

131
0:09:08.000 --> 0:09:15.680
and a wide range of different open source projects which made flight on Mars possible.

132
0:09:15.680 --> 0:09:24.960
Another project, and this one is personally important to me because it's one that I've

133
0:09:24.960 --> 0:09:28.840
contributed directly to, is the James Webb Space Telescope.

134
0:09:28.840 --> 0:09:31.760
This was launched just over a year ago.

135
0:09:31.760 --> 0:09:36.840
And it is a partnership between NASA, European Space Agency, ESA, and the Canadian Space

136
0:09:36.840 --> 0:09:39.200
Agency.

137
0:09:39.200 --> 0:09:43.160
And I really want to actually once again actually like emphasize the fact that these projects,

138
0:09:43.160 --> 0:09:49.320
these massive projects which took almost 30 years to build, was an international collaboration

139
0:09:49.320 --> 0:09:56.520
with a wide range of different agencies across different NASA centers, 14 different countries,

140
0:09:56.520 --> 0:09:58.560
including Belgium right here.

141
0:09:58.560 --> 0:10:04.520
Part of the Miri spectrograph was built here in Belgium along with actually one of the

142
0:10:04.520 --> 0:10:08.280
leads for the Miri spectrograph, the law resolution spectrograph.

143
0:10:08.280 --> 0:10:13.000
Sarah Kendra was actually born and raised in Belgium.

144
0:10:13.000 --> 0:10:20.720
And so these projects take a wide range and a large community to actually support and

145
0:10:20.720 --> 0:10:24.720
actually produce these projects.

146
0:10:24.720 --> 0:10:30.400
And so the wonderful and beautiful thing is that after its launch and after its commissioning,

147
0:10:30.400 --> 0:10:34.880
James Webb Space Telescope did start to produce beautiful, beautiful images.

148
0:10:34.880 --> 0:10:39.160
And so Jade was tea is here as one of the first images of the Carina Nebula.

149
0:10:39.160 --> 0:10:46.160
This is a small part of the overall image or a small part of the overall nebula showing

150
0:10:46.160 --> 0:10:53.600
the dust clouds which are actually home to new stars which are forming there.

151
0:10:53.600 --> 0:10:56.240
And not only is it producing imaging, but it's also producing spectra.

152
0:10:56.240 --> 0:11:01.640
And this is an example and one of the first spectra of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

153
0:11:01.640 --> 0:11:04.320
of another of a planet orbiting another star.

154
0:11:04.320 --> 0:11:09.160
So it's in the atmosphere of a planet which is orbiting another star and it's detected

155
0:11:09.160 --> 0:11:14.480
by the spectrograph and by looking at as that planet passes in front of the star, you

156
0:11:14.480 --> 0:11:17.040
can actually do observations of it.

157
0:11:17.040 --> 0:11:21.600
You subtract off the effects of the star and you can actually see what the spectrum of

158
0:11:21.600 --> 0:11:24.000
that atmosphere of that planet is.

159
0:11:24.000 --> 0:11:28.960
This is the first detection of CO2 and this came out roughly about a month after we started

160
0:11:28.960 --> 0:11:30.880
producing public data from the telescope.

161
0:11:30.880 --> 0:11:33.160
We started releasing data.

162
0:11:33.160 --> 0:11:37.200
And here's a great quote from Natasha Patalje who is one of the leads on it, that NASA's

163
0:11:37.200 --> 0:11:41.280
Open Science Guidance Principles are centered in our early release science work supporting

164
0:11:41.280 --> 0:11:45.260
an inclusive, transparent and collaborative scientific process.

165
0:11:45.260 --> 0:11:49.680
They could actually produce their science so quickly in one month, this discovery one

166
0:11:49.680 --> 0:11:55.280
month after they started releasing data because of Open Science and Open Source software.

167
0:11:55.280 --> 0:12:00.880
They're able to test their software and their processes before the launch of the telescope

168
0:12:00.880 --> 0:12:04.360
because all the calibration software was made publicly available.

169
0:12:04.360 --> 0:12:09.520
The data for this project, for our early release projects were made publicly available as soon

170
0:12:09.520 --> 0:12:12.320
as they were observed.

171
0:12:12.320 --> 0:12:15.800
And they also are a great example of Open Science as well.

172
0:12:15.800 --> 0:12:21.040
They've made all their data, all of their software and all of their results openly accessible

173
0:12:21.040 --> 0:12:22.040
as well.

174
0:12:22.040 --> 0:12:25.680
So if you want to actually go and reproduce this spectra for yourselves, you can actually

175
0:12:25.680 --> 0:12:32.000
go and download their software which is uploaded to Zenodo and take a look at it.

176
0:12:32.000 --> 0:12:37.320
And so as I said, this is all made possible by having the software made openly available

177
0:12:37.320 --> 0:12:41.720
and this is part of all the Jade with Sea calibration software, the software which is

178
0:12:41.720 --> 0:12:49.080
actually used to actually produce and science calibration and science ready images is all

179
0:12:49.080 --> 0:12:52.440
openly developed on GitHub.

180
0:12:52.440 --> 0:12:56.120
It enables scientists to test their projects before it became available but also allows

181
0:12:56.120 --> 0:13:00.680
them to feed back to the project, to actually, when they find bugs or when they find a better

182
0:13:00.680 --> 0:13:05.560
algorithm for calibrating the data, they can contribute it back to the program so that

183
0:13:05.560 --> 0:13:09.920
it actually can then be shared with a wider audience.

184
0:13:09.920 --> 0:13:14.000
And one thing that actually makes this available is it builds on the wider scientific Python

185
0:13:14.000 --> 0:13:18.640
environment and then contributes back to that community as well.

186
0:13:18.640 --> 0:13:23.720
And the way that this did it was it contributes and JBST and that team contributes back to

187
0:13:23.720 --> 0:13:25.320
the Astropy project.

188
0:13:25.320 --> 0:13:28.480
And this is a common Python library for astronomy.

189
0:13:28.480 --> 0:13:29.480
It builds on NumPy.

190
0:13:29.480 --> 0:13:36.360
And it started in 2011 basically from an astronomy and Python mailing list.

191
0:13:36.360 --> 0:13:41.240
People had been actually emailing on the list saying I've just released a new generalized

192
0:13:41.240 --> 0:13:45.600
package for astronomy and after about the third email someone said why don't we all

193
0:13:45.600 --> 0:13:47.760
work together?

194
0:13:47.760 --> 0:13:51.440
And basically everyone did actually agree to that.

195
0:13:51.440 --> 0:13:56.480
We ended up getting together and working together to produce a generalized astronomy package.

196
0:13:56.480 --> 0:14:01.480
And not only was it graduate students and software engineers and astronomers from around

197
0:14:01.480 --> 0:14:05.280
the world but it also included those software engineers and astronomers working on some

198
0:14:05.280 --> 0:14:10.800
of our biggest projects like the Hubble Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

199
0:14:10.800 --> 0:14:15.520
Since it's actually released it's been used in over 10,000 publications making it really

200
0:14:15.520 --> 0:14:18.480
widely available and widely used.

201
0:14:18.480 --> 0:14:24.000
But we do have, you know, and on the images from the recent paper of showing actually

202
0:14:24.000 --> 0:14:27.360
where it's being used and where it's available.

203
0:14:27.360 --> 0:14:32.840
And you can see it's all over the world but along with that the dots on the graphic represent

204
0:14:32.840 --> 0:14:36.720
where the maintainers from the project are.

205
0:14:36.720 --> 0:14:40.840
Where the people who've been contributing to the project and they're spread out through

206
0:14:40.840 --> 0:14:47.920
both North America and Europe with some South American and global south representation as

207
0:14:47.920 --> 0:14:50.640
well.

208
0:14:50.640 --> 0:14:55.080
And so I'm just going to pause again here and I'm going to put up another JWST early

209
0:14:55.080 --> 0:14:59.880
release image which is the Galaxy cluster SMAC0723.

210
0:14:59.880 --> 0:15:06.560
And this image also has a lot of importance to me because when I was doing my PhD in astronomy

211
0:15:06.560 --> 0:15:09.280
I studied objects which were very similar to this.

212
0:15:09.280 --> 0:15:13.920
Galaxy clusters are some of the largest, they are the largest gravitationally bound objects

213
0:15:13.920 --> 0:15:14.920
in the universe.

214
0:15:14.920 --> 0:15:21.240
They're the most massive objects having billions and billions of solar masses of billion billions

215
0:15:21.240 --> 0:15:25.760
times more massive than our own sun and are the largest collections of objects.

216
0:15:25.760 --> 0:15:31.040
And what you're seeing in this image is not only the galaxies which are part of this cluster

217
0:15:31.040 --> 0:15:33.800
but you're also seeing the effects of general relativity.

218
0:15:33.800 --> 0:15:38.160
They're bending the light from the galaxies which are behind them.

219
0:15:38.160 --> 0:15:42.760
Only a few hundred million or billion years older than the big bang.

220
0:15:42.760 --> 0:15:49.440
And they're bending that light due to the mass of that galaxy is warping the space and

221
0:15:49.440 --> 0:15:53.280
time around it to focus those light on those background galaxies on us.

222
0:15:53.280 --> 0:15:58.360
And we're seeing that through those galaxies which are streaked and bent around it.

223
0:15:58.360 --> 0:16:00.720
These are the background galaxies around it.

224
0:16:00.720 --> 0:16:04.440
And as I said, during my PhD I studied objects like this, galaxy clusters.

225
0:16:04.440 --> 0:16:10.880
And when I was writing my PhD I wrote code in C and in Perl and I would put it into a

226
0:16:10.880 --> 0:16:14.880
tar ball and put it up on my own personal website.

227
0:16:14.880 --> 0:16:20.400
And after I had gotten my PhD and moved down, I actually moved down to South Africa to work

228
0:16:20.400 --> 0:16:23.560
on a telescope there called the Southern African Large Telescope.

229
0:16:23.560 --> 0:16:27.520
And I had to build a data management system for it except we had no resources.

230
0:16:27.520 --> 0:16:29.840
I was the only resource.

231
0:16:29.840 --> 0:16:32.480
And so I turned to the open source software.

232
0:16:32.480 --> 0:16:38.280
I turned to free software to actually use a wide variety of resources to build a very,

233
0:16:38.280 --> 0:16:42.880
very cost effective data management system for it.

234
0:16:42.880 --> 0:16:46.240
And during, you know, and it actually helped make it one of the most productive 10 meter

235
0:16:46.240 --> 0:16:48.200
class telescopes.

236
0:16:48.200 --> 0:16:52.980
During that time was when I was working down there when I received that email about Astro

237
0:16:52.980 --> 0:16:53.980
Pi.

238
0:16:53.980 --> 0:16:57.320
And it was, you know, this is my actual, even though I'd been releasing software, this is

239
0:16:57.320 --> 0:17:02.720
really my start into open source software where it actually is getting involved of a

240
0:17:02.720 --> 0:17:07.400
community of like minded people who wanted to actually solve a similar problem.

241
0:17:07.400 --> 0:17:11.360
And it was really actually when I saw the potential of actually working together and

242
0:17:11.360 --> 0:17:15.680
sharing our software and how we did things that actually really solved the power of open

243
0:17:15.680 --> 0:17:17.800
source software.

244
0:17:17.800 --> 0:17:24.520
And, you know, that's actually then, and if you told me about 10 years ago or so that

245
0:17:24.520 --> 0:17:29.640
I'd be here talking to you now having actually worked in South Africa for a while and then

246
0:17:29.640 --> 0:17:34.280
moved on to work and manage the team that was developing the JBC calibration software

247
0:17:34.280 --> 0:17:40.760
and now working at NASA sharing open science across all of our different divisions and

248
0:17:40.760 --> 0:17:45.320
helping to further open the science, I wouldn't have actually believed you if you told me

249
0:17:45.320 --> 0:17:49.320
that 10 years ago that this is where getting involved in open source would have actually

250
0:17:49.320 --> 0:17:51.520
eventually led me to.

251
0:17:51.520 --> 0:17:56.780
But I'm here now and it's been actually really, really fascinating to hear all the immense

252
0:17:56.780 --> 0:18:01.360
and fantastic open source work which has been going on at this conference.

253
0:18:01.360 --> 0:18:07.080
But I just want to actually show, you know, going back to what NASA does, this is less

254
0:18:07.080 --> 0:18:10.360
than 1% of the open source used by NASA.

255
0:18:10.360 --> 0:18:15.200
This is just a, basically NASA and the wide range of NASA projects is touching on just

256
0:18:15.200 --> 0:18:18.800
about every bit of open source that you can imagine.

257
0:18:18.800 --> 0:18:24.440
Likewise NASA and the people working at NASA release a huge amount of open source.

258
0:18:24.440 --> 0:18:28.440
This is less than 1% of the open source that's being released by NASA.

259
0:18:28.440 --> 0:18:35.080
And it's a wide range of different projects touching on both planetary science, astronomy,

260
0:18:35.080 --> 0:18:41.640
astrophysics, earth science, along with technology development and other aspects.

261
0:18:41.640 --> 0:18:44.640
NASA loves to actually spin off the things that we're doing.

262
0:18:44.640 --> 0:18:50.440
NASTRAM was a program for engineering and fine element analysis developed in the 60s

263
0:18:50.440 --> 0:18:52.920
and released as public domain in the 70s.

264
0:18:52.920 --> 0:19:00.200
It now underlines, it still underlines a number of engineering codes which are out there and

265
0:19:00.200 --> 0:19:07.200
own engineering software which is out there, but NASA loves to actually spin out our projects.

266
0:19:07.200 --> 0:19:15.320
Another two examples of our spinoffs is OpenStack which is underlying on premise cloud computing.

267
0:19:15.320 --> 0:19:21.000
We still use this in our ADAPT supercomputer center and for our on premise cloud computing

268
0:19:21.000 --> 0:19:22.680
it's still often used.

269
0:19:22.680 --> 0:19:29.040
But we've, with Rackspace we've handed this over to the community and to the wider community

270
0:19:29.040 --> 0:19:30.480
to further develop.

271
0:19:30.480 --> 0:19:35.920
OODT is another program that was developed for data management and for handling files,

272
0:19:35.920 --> 0:19:40.800
likewise handed over to the Apache Foundation for that to be further developed to the community.

273
0:19:40.800 --> 0:19:45.720
We're still, NASA is still a participant in it, NASA still uses some of this software,

274
0:19:45.720 --> 0:19:49.880
but we are now just a member of a much larger community which are using these different

275
0:19:49.880 --> 0:19:52.080
projects.

276
0:19:52.080 --> 0:19:55.600
But sometimes it's still important for us to actually take the lead and develop our

277
0:19:55.600 --> 0:19:57.640
software ourselves.

278
0:19:57.640 --> 0:20:00.520
And the JPL SPICE toolkit is an example of this.

279
0:20:00.520 --> 0:20:07.400
This is for spacecraft ephemeris, planet satellite comet or asteroid ephemeris' instrument information,

280
0:20:07.400 --> 0:20:10.200
orientation information and events information.

281
0:20:10.200 --> 0:20:14.200
This is a software that you use if you want to know a comet or an asteroid that you want

282
0:20:14.200 --> 0:20:16.560
to land on will be in ten years.

283
0:20:16.560 --> 0:20:21.200
This is how we actually determine the positions and velocities of spacecraft, of planets,

284
0:20:21.200 --> 0:20:25.360
of other objects which are all moving throughout our solar system.

285
0:20:25.360 --> 0:20:28.360
This is, this software needs to be incredibly precise.

286
0:20:28.360 --> 0:20:33.000
If you get something wrong now in a very small amount and you try and land on your comet

287
0:20:33.000 --> 0:20:39.320
in ten years, you will be nowhere close to it and you will have no hope of recovering.

288
0:20:39.320 --> 0:20:44.360
And so there actually is a very, very rigorous process to actually contribute and to actually

289
0:20:44.360 --> 0:20:45.880
make changes to this code.

290
0:20:45.880 --> 0:20:51.160
It's made very slowly, very carefully because once again if you even get the floating points

291
0:20:51.160 --> 0:20:55.480
a little bit off or depending on even how the hardware works or specific hardware, you

292
0:20:55.480 --> 0:20:57.720
may get different results.

293
0:20:57.720 --> 0:21:01.640
And there is actually, and it was primarily originally developed in C and they did release

294
0:21:01.640 --> 0:21:04.200
some other interfaces for it.

295
0:21:04.200 --> 0:21:08.120
And it is released as open source but it's not openly developed currently.

296
0:21:08.120 --> 0:21:14.600
This is something funded by the planetary data system and so there is actually regular

297
0:21:14.600 --> 0:21:21.120
support for it and it's a great team that is currently further developing it.

298
0:21:21.120 --> 0:21:23.640
But there's also wrappers that have been developed for it.

299
0:21:23.640 --> 0:21:31.040
And Andrew Nx developed Spice Pi which is a Python wrapper for this toolkit and it's

300
0:21:31.040 --> 0:21:33.120
been used in a wide range of different missions.

301
0:21:33.120 --> 0:21:36.800
It's actually now used by 80% of all spice users.

302
0:21:36.800 --> 0:21:42.960
It's been used in Konsini of the Mars orbiter.

303
0:21:42.960 --> 0:21:47.480
It's very widely used in our range of different missions.

304
0:21:47.480 --> 0:21:49.960
But Andrew developed this when he was an undergraduate.

305
0:21:49.960 --> 0:21:53.480
He was working on the Konsini mission and probably like a lot of people, he just wanted

306
0:21:53.480 --> 0:21:58.320
to use Spice and Python and at the time there wasn't a way to do it and so he solved the

307
0:21:58.320 --> 0:21:59.320
problem.

308
0:21:59.320 --> 0:22:03.640
He developed and released it as open source software and everyone else started using it

309
0:22:03.640 --> 0:22:04.840
as well.

310
0:22:04.840 --> 0:22:08.740
And Andrew continued development for two years in his spare time while he was actually post

311
0:22:08.740 --> 0:22:15.000
his undergraduate and not even employed working on any of the missions.

312
0:22:15.000 --> 0:22:18.920
Fortunately enough he did go back for his PhD and he's now currently a postdoc at Caltech

313
0:22:18.920 --> 0:22:20.880
so he's doing fine.

314
0:22:20.880 --> 0:22:25.920
But even though it's actually so widely used it wasn't actually clearly about how it was

315
0:22:25.920 --> 0:22:33.300
being funded or the limited recognition, for example not very cited in the community even

316
0:22:33.300 --> 0:22:38.760
though it's actually becoming so critical to many projects that were actually actively

317
0:22:38.760 --> 0:22:39.760
using it.

318
0:22:39.760 --> 0:22:44.680
And so that gets us to some of the challenges of NASA and open source.

319
0:22:44.680 --> 0:22:49.680
And so as I mentioned one thing there was a good challenge of how do we actually go

320
0:22:49.680 --> 0:22:55.080
from something which is just being developed as someone trying to solve their own problem

321
0:22:55.080 --> 0:22:57.720
but then ends up being widely used in the community.

322
0:22:57.720 --> 0:23:00.320
How do we actually develop that model?

323
0:23:00.320 --> 0:23:02.480
NASA also contributes.

324
0:23:02.480 --> 0:23:04.840
People working at NASA also contribute to open source.

325
0:23:04.840 --> 0:23:08.960
Here's Leo Singer just last week contributing to an open source project because he needed

326
0:23:08.960 --> 0:23:15.000
to fix it and fix a bug in it to make it work for his use case.

327
0:23:15.000 --> 0:23:19.000
But oftentimes it's not actually very clear about how that actually works for the NASA

328
0:23:19.000 --> 0:23:22.920
employee or the person working at NASA.

329
0:23:22.920 --> 0:23:27.200
And this is also not always very clear about also when we need to do things like sign contributor

330
0:23:27.200 --> 0:23:30.680
license agreements or other aspects how that works.

331
0:23:30.680 --> 0:23:35.880
And so sometimes often people working on NASA will do it so they get it done but it's not

332
0:23:35.880 --> 0:23:40.360
really clear about how they should be doing it.

333
0:23:40.360 --> 0:23:45.540
There's also licensing at NASA.

334
0:23:45.540 --> 0:23:50.800
About 20 years ago NASA created the NASA open source agreement and they're trying to solve

335
0:23:50.800 --> 0:23:52.840
a very specific problem.

336
0:23:52.840 --> 0:24:00.240
Civil servants by US law civil servants can't produce work that is copyrightable.

337
0:24:00.240 --> 0:24:04.360
Most open source licenses actually work based on copyright.

338
0:24:04.360 --> 0:24:10.440
And so if you're not allowed to produce something that's copyrightable that you can copyright

339
0:24:10.440 --> 0:24:15.880
you can't use an existing open source license to actually protect it.

340
0:24:15.880 --> 0:24:20.200
They came up with the and there really wasn't much guidance in the US government at that

341
0:24:20.200 --> 0:24:23.320
time about releasing as open source software.

342
0:24:23.320 --> 0:24:28.280
And so they came up with actually a relatively innovative solution at the time which is this

343
0:24:28.280 --> 0:24:34.520
NOSA license to actually enable civil servants to release their software as open source following

344
0:24:34.520 --> 0:24:36.520
this framework.

345
0:24:36.520 --> 0:24:39.040
Unfortunately it isn't widely recognized in the community.

346
0:24:39.040 --> 0:24:44.160
It is not recognized by the Free Software Foundation and it does complicate the reuse

347
0:24:44.160 --> 0:24:47.180
of NASA software.

348
0:24:47.180 --> 0:24:49.080
We also have bureaucracy at NASA.

349
0:24:49.080 --> 0:24:54.020
NASA is a very large government agency.

350
0:24:54.020 --> 0:24:58.740
And sometimes even though NASA does have a process of releasing software and it's released

351
0:24:58.740 --> 0:25:04.920
over 500 officially released over 500 open source packages the processes can be long.

352
0:25:04.920 --> 0:25:09.400
We also not always best in engaging with the open source community and here's a tweet from

353
0:25:09.400 --> 0:25:15.720
Daniel Steinberg about getting emails from NASA asking us or asking him about the status

354
0:25:15.720 --> 0:25:22.580
of CURL and whether or not it can be actually used in different ways.

355
0:25:22.580 --> 0:25:26.120
And that's an additional burden for people who may be actually working on this in their

356
0:25:26.120 --> 0:25:29.000
volunteer time or not being paid.

357
0:25:29.000 --> 0:25:33.520
If we actually have to figure out if the software is secure or what the risks associated with

358
0:25:33.520 --> 0:25:38.900
that software are that should be our responsibility but actually how that works with the open

359
0:25:38.900 --> 0:25:45.520
source framework and open source communities can be actually different aspects.

360
0:25:45.520 --> 0:25:50.080
But CURL is actually something which is critical especially to our data management systems.

361
0:25:50.080 --> 0:25:56.080
It's being used very widely across NASA and how that actually comes into play and in different

362
0:25:56.080 --> 0:26:00.720
places ends up being something that we have to actually figure out how to actually resolve

363
0:26:00.720 --> 0:26:07.640
and actually make sure that the software that we're using is being used appropriately.

364
0:26:07.640 --> 0:26:13.320
I think there was a great talk earlier today on the security of software by Brian Bellendoff

365
0:26:13.320 --> 0:26:18.240
and that's going to be an ongoing question about how to answer that.

366
0:26:18.240 --> 0:26:24.760
And I always put up this XKCD comic on sustainability of open source software because it's better

367
0:26:24.760 --> 0:26:29.900
than if I could write 10 white papers and it won't have the same effect as this to actually

368
0:26:29.900 --> 0:26:35.200
indicate sometimes the problems and issues around sustainability.

369
0:26:35.200 --> 0:26:42.240
And all of our open source systems or not maybe not all of them but a lot of them do

370
0:26:42.240 --> 0:26:47.880
actually depend on a small number of developers who are actually maintaining it and keeping

371
0:26:47.880 --> 0:26:50.560
the code active and working.

372
0:26:50.560 --> 0:26:56.960
And there is actually and there was a great talk yesterday on the sustainability of open

373
0:26:56.960 --> 0:27:06.720
source and NASA does need reliable, secure and software especially for our space operations.

374
0:27:06.720 --> 0:27:09.360
And so what are we doing for the next steps?

375
0:27:09.360 --> 0:27:13.880
And within the science mission director we've actually started up a new couple of new things

376
0:27:13.880 --> 0:27:17.720
to actually help with this and help address some of these challenges.

377
0:27:17.720 --> 0:27:21.440
We've recently set up the Chief Science Data Office which I'm part of and as part of that

378
0:27:21.440 --> 0:27:23.760
we've set up the open source science initiative.

379
0:27:23.760 --> 0:27:28.920
This is one part of it is to help actually support open source software at NASA.

380
0:27:28.920 --> 0:27:35.520
The other part of it is also helping to extend open science across the entire mission directorate.

381
0:27:35.520 --> 0:27:37.640
And so what is open science?

382
0:27:37.640 --> 0:27:41.800
Open science is a principle and practice of making research products and processes available

383
0:27:41.800 --> 0:27:46.920
to all while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy and fostering

384
0:27:46.920 --> 0:27:51.680
collaborations, reproducibility and equity.

385
0:27:51.680 --> 0:27:56.240
And we really are focused on increasing accessibility, reproducibility and inclusion when we're actually

386
0:27:56.240 --> 0:28:02.440
working on open science across NASA.

387
0:28:02.440 --> 0:28:05.640
But within SMD we want to take that a step further.

388
0:28:05.640 --> 0:28:08.480
And this is why we started the open source science in practice.

389
0:28:08.480 --> 0:28:12.200
We definitely want to take not only just make our products openly available but we want

390
0:28:12.200 --> 0:28:17.080
to take the processes of science and open those up in much the way of open source software

391
0:28:17.080 --> 0:28:18.400
development.

392
0:28:18.400 --> 0:28:22.360
We want to open the entirety of the scientific process from start to finish.

393
0:28:22.360 --> 0:28:26.400
We want to broaden community involvement in the scientific process, increase accessibility

394
0:28:26.400 --> 0:28:31.560
of our data, software and publications and facilitate inclusion, transparency and reproducibility

395
0:28:31.560 --> 0:28:34.760
of science.

396
0:28:34.760 --> 0:28:41.680
And so with the NASA's open source science initiative we have, it is supporting scientists

397
0:28:41.680 --> 0:28:47.280
to integrate open science principles into the entirety of the research workflow.

398
0:28:47.280 --> 0:28:53.720
The NASA's OSSI is $20 million per year and we're hoping to actually increase that further

399
0:28:53.720 --> 0:28:57.360
effort to increase open science across NASA.

400
0:28:57.360 --> 0:29:02.360
We have four areas that we're mainly focusing on which is infrastructure, policy, funding

401
0:29:02.360 --> 0:29:04.800
and community.

402
0:29:04.800 --> 0:29:08.800
I'm going to touch on some of the work that we're doing in these three, at least the three

403
0:29:08.800 --> 0:29:11.680
different areas.

404
0:29:11.680 --> 0:29:15.320
And so one thing is new policy.

405
0:29:15.320 --> 0:29:19.200
And so last month we released the SMD's new policy on scientific information.

406
0:29:19.200 --> 0:29:24.760
We want to make things as open as possible, as restricted as necessary and always secure.

407
0:29:24.760 --> 0:29:30.240
And this new policy says that our publications, the research which is done and funded by NASA,

408
0:29:30.240 --> 0:29:34.560
are made openly available with no period of embargo.

409
0:29:34.560 --> 0:29:38.880
That our research data and software are shared at the time of publication, that they are

410
0:29:38.880 --> 0:29:44.960
made openly so that you can reproduce the science which is actually being done from

411
0:29:44.960 --> 0:29:45.960
our work.

412
0:29:45.960 --> 0:29:51.600
And that you're able to actually also then reuse that science to actually build on it.

413
0:29:51.600 --> 0:29:55.680
That our mission data are released as soon as possible and freely available.

414
0:29:55.680 --> 0:30:02.000
And that free is actually both free as in beer, there's no charge to actually using

415
0:30:02.000 --> 0:30:03.040
our data.

416
0:30:03.040 --> 0:30:09.160
We make it free to download, free to access that data, and free as in speech as there's

417
0:30:09.160 --> 0:30:12.520
no restriction in what you can do with that data.

418
0:30:12.520 --> 0:30:17.760
And so that you can actually go and do whatever you want with the data we release.

419
0:30:17.760 --> 0:30:21.560
That data will be released under a Creative Commons Zero license.

420
0:30:21.560 --> 0:30:25.680
So it's clearly in the public domain for everyone.

421
0:30:25.680 --> 0:30:28.400
That our unrestricted mission software is developed openly.

422
0:30:28.400 --> 0:30:32.760
We've learned these lessons from JWST that having that software available for everyone

423
0:30:32.760 --> 0:30:37.800
to actually be able to both have access to it and also reuse it improves how science

424
0:30:37.800 --> 0:30:39.000
is done.

425
0:30:39.000 --> 0:30:41.740
That we recognize software as a scientific product.

426
0:30:41.740 --> 0:30:45.000
Our software is just as critical to our research.

427
0:30:45.000 --> 0:30:49.600
And that we'll be using these common open source licenses like Creative Commons Zero

428
0:30:49.600 --> 0:30:55.160
for our data and permissive commonly used software licenses for our software like Apache,

429
0:30:55.160 --> 0:30:58.600
BSD or MIT licenses.

430
0:30:58.600 --> 0:31:03.600
And we encourage using and contributing to open source software as part of our missions

431
0:31:03.600 --> 0:31:06.440
and our research.

432
0:31:06.440 --> 0:31:10.560
But we're actually going to be also releasing further policies and updating further processes

433
0:31:10.560 --> 0:31:19.760
to make it easier for NASA employees and NASA people being working with NASA to contribute,

434
0:31:19.760 --> 0:31:21.560
release and use open source software.

435
0:31:21.560 --> 0:31:25.240
So there's more coming to make it easier.

436
0:31:25.240 --> 0:31:28.920
The other thing is we're directly funding open source software especially in the scientific

437
0:31:28.920 --> 0:31:29.920
environment.

438
0:31:29.920 --> 0:31:35.600
In over the last two years we've selected over 16 proposals supporting 22 different

439
0:31:35.600 --> 0:31:38.760
projects which we're providing direct support to.

440
0:31:38.760 --> 0:31:41.840
This call was specifically for sustainability.

441
0:31:41.840 --> 0:31:43.240
We weren't asking for anything new.

442
0:31:43.240 --> 0:31:47.600
We weren't asking for new features or new products.

443
0:31:47.600 --> 0:31:53.160
What we were asking was please make sure this software works as best as you can and that's

444
0:31:53.160 --> 0:31:58.640
sustainable that we can actually continue to use this and we've supported this with

445
0:31:58.640 --> 0:32:03.480
over $3 million so far.

446
0:32:03.480 --> 0:32:07.640
We're also and this is the next thing that we're kicking off this year is NASA's transform

447
0:32:07.640 --> 0:32:08.960
to open science.

448
0:32:08.960 --> 0:32:13.960
There's some stickers that already I think have disappeared very quickly.

449
0:32:13.960 --> 0:32:18.360
But the NASA TOPS effort is a 40 million five year mission to accelerate adoption of open

450
0:32:18.360 --> 0:32:19.480
science.

451
0:32:19.480 --> 0:32:26.400
We're aiming to train 20,000 researchers to earn a NASA open science badge and certification

452
0:32:26.400 --> 0:32:29.560
which includes how to open source your software.

453
0:32:29.560 --> 0:32:34.400
We want to double the participation of historically excluded groups across NASA science and we

454
0:32:34.400 --> 0:32:38.400
want to enable five major scientific discoveries through open science principles.

455
0:32:38.400 --> 0:32:43.440
And we're going to do this through engagement, capacity sharing, incentives and coordination

456
0:32:43.440 --> 0:32:45.120
across the community.

457
0:32:45.120 --> 0:32:48.200
We're also following our own advice here.

458
0:32:48.200 --> 0:32:52.040
Everything that we're doing with this project is going to be open sourced on GitHub so that

459
0:32:52.040 --> 0:32:54.640
community members can contribute it.

460
0:32:54.640 --> 0:33:00.000
And we're kicking this all off with a year of open science of 2023.

461
0:33:00.000 --> 0:33:03.680
And this is the start of the project.

462
0:33:03.680 --> 0:33:06.200
As I said, it's all going to be up on GitHub.

463
0:33:06.200 --> 0:33:10.680
Definitely please check it out and please engage with the community.

464
0:33:10.680 --> 0:33:17.000
But we're also not the only U.S. government agency contributing to the year of open science.

465
0:33:17.000 --> 0:33:22.360
This month the White House did actually announce that 2023 would be a year of open science.

466
0:33:22.360 --> 0:33:25.840
And there's going to be more stuff being announced by other U.S. agencies as well.

467
0:33:25.840 --> 0:33:31.320
And we hope actually as many of you who are open and interested in science also take step

468
0:33:31.320 --> 0:33:37.360
forward to actually make your science and your results more open as well.

469
0:33:37.360 --> 0:33:45.840
And so I want to also talk about the opportunities for open for NASA and for using open science.

470
0:33:45.840 --> 0:33:49.520
And one of the most important things that we do and one of the most important aspects

471
0:33:49.520 --> 0:33:54.840
of or most immediate aspects of the science mission directorate is our contributions to

472
0:33:54.840 --> 0:34:00.840
the earth of studying the huge impacts of climate change, about how that will affect

473
0:34:00.840 --> 0:34:06.000
our future, issues around environmental justice and other issues.

474
0:34:06.000 --> 0:34:10.840
And the way we are supporting it is that we do make all of our NASA data open.

475
0:34:10.840 --> 0:34:15.360
We have over 70 petabytes of data which is available in the cloud and even more that's

476
0:34:15.360 --> 0:34:20.360
available in different systems that are open for you to use in any way that you like to

477
0:34:20.360 --> 0:34:23.080
help address these questions.

478
0:34:23.080 --> 0:34:29.800
We have open APIs through these data sets which is all developed on NASA GitHub and

479
0:34:29.800 --> 0:34:32.840
provide as open access to the wider community.

480
0:34:32.840 --> 0:34:40.040
We are making these available to users around the world to those who actually need the data

481
0:34:40.040 --> 0:34:43.400
and most impacted by it.

482
0:34:43.400 --> 0:34:48.640
And there's actually I know there's a big session here on the environmental impacts

483
0:34:48.640 --> 0:34:52.680
and there's a great talk this morning on and I wanted to share one of the examples from

484
0:34:52.680 --> 0:34:55.000
NASA, which is the power project.

485
0:34:55.000 --> 0:34:59.000
It provides solar and meteorological data sets for NASA research for supporting renewable

486
0:34:59.000 --> 0:35:03.280
energy and building energy efficient and agriculture needs.

487
0:35:03.280 --> 0:35:05.360
We have made all the data freely available.

488
0:35:05.360 --> 0:35:09.560
We've also partnered with AWS to make the data freely available on there so that you

489
0:35:09.560 --> 0:35:16.200
can have access to this almost one and this data set to actually develop the apps to build

490
0:35:16.200 --> 0:35:20.840
the open source tools on top of this to actually use it in different ways that you can.

491
0:35:20.840 --> 0:35:25.880
To actually answer some of the toughest questions that we have around climate change and our

492
0:35:25.880 --> 0:35:26.880
environment.

493
0:35:26.880 --> 0:35:32.360
But we're also putting actually another five petabytes of data openly available on AWS

494
0:35:32.360 --> 0:35:37.000
and we're also looking to provide it on other cloud providers as well so that the data is

495
0:35:37.000 --> 0:35:39.960
there where you need it and where you can use it.

496
0:35:39.960 --> 0:35:43.800
And so we're actually looking to actually put our data in places where it's most useful

497
0:35:43.800 --> 0:35:48.040
and to partner with as many different groups that we can to actually put that data in useful

498
0:35:48.040 --> 0:35:50.040
places.

499
0:35:50.040 --> 0:35:52.280
And this is only actually the start.

500
0:35:52.280 --> 0:35:57.440
It's coming up next is our Earth System Observatories which we're doing in partnerships with the

501
0:35:57.440 --> 0:36:02.640
European Space Agency and JAXA that are actually going to give even a closer view of the climate

502
0:36:02.640 --> 0:36:07.240
effects on Earth and actually a better study of how these different effects both on changing

503
0:36:07.240 --> 0:36:14.240
our surface, changing our world, changing our climate and our different particles.

504
0:36:14.240 --> 0:36:18.760
These are how produce over 600 petabytes of data.

505
0:36:18.760 --> 0:36:22.520
And we're going to make this all freely available and accessible to the world to be able to

506
0:36:22.520 --> 0:36:29.320
actually access it and look at it and build things on it to answer these questions.

507
0:36:29.320 --> 0:36:34.720
And so we also have a lot, as I mentioned, NASA has released already a lot of open source

508
0:36:34.720 --> 0:36:35.720
software.

509
0:36:35.720 --> 0:36:39.800
We have a number of different ways to discover what may actually be out there.

510
0:36:39.800 --> 0:36:43.840
Code.NASA.gov is our site for our open source software at NASA.

511
0:36:43.840 --> 0:36:47.580
It has over 500 projects which have been officially released.

512
0:36:47.580 --> 0:36:50.960
We also have just released the Science Discovery Engine.

513
0:36:50.960 --> 0:36:57.880
This is actually a system to actually explore both all of our different data sets, software

514
0:36:57.880 --> 0:37:02.480
design and technical documents across all of the science mission directory.

515
0:37:02.480 --> 0:37:07.240
It has a listing I think currently of about 44,000 different pieces of software that have

516
0:37:07.240 --> 0:37:12.640
been released by different NASA researchers and missions.

517
0:37:12.640 --> 0:37:14.200
We have the NASA software catalog.

518
0:37:14.200 --> 0:37:17.880
We also have the NASA GitHub which has over 500 repositories on it.

519
0:37:17.880 --> 0:37:20.360
But we also have all the different partners which are on GitHub.

520
0:37:20.360 --> 0:37:24.000
JPL has their software on GitHub, Space Telescope.

521
0:37:24.000 --> 0:37:28.280
It has the JBFC and the Hubble software on GitHub.

522
0:37:28.280 --> 0:37:31.880
There's also a lot of other people who have posted their own NASA research software around

523
0:37:31.880 --> 0:37:32.880
there.

524
0:37:32.880 --> 0:37:33.880
We also have the Astrophysics Data Service.

525
0:37:33.880 --> 0:37:39.160
And you can also search the Software Heritage Archive which is archiving a lot of software

526
0:37:39.160 --> 0:37:43.520
across a wide range of different domains.

527
0:37:43.520 --> 0:37:49.720
And so we're really actually looking ahead at the really big challenges and trying to

528
0:37:49.720 --> 0:37:51.680
answer the big questions.

529
0:37:51.680 --> 0:38:00.800
There's the DART mission which earlier this year impacted on an asteroid, on a Dephmoraphis

530
0:38:00.800 --> 0:38:04.880
which is circling around another asteroid to actually detect to see if we could actually

531
0:38:04.880 --> 0:38:06.720
change its trajectory.

532
0:38:06.720 --> 0:38:11.120
If we can actually change the directory early enough of an asteroid, we can hopefully make

533
0:38:11.120 --> 0:38:15.440
sure that it deflects and avoids the Earth by using for example the SPICE toolkit to

534
0:38:15.440 --> 0:38:19.240
actually study where it's actually going to be moving and predicting it.

535
0:38:19.240 --> 0:38:25.600
And hopefully, ideally, protect the planet and avoid the same fate as the dinosaurs.

536
0:38:25.600 --> 0:38:29.000
But obviously this is all building and this wide range is building off a wide range of

537
0:38:29.000 --> 0:38:31.520
open source software.

538
0:38:31.520 --> 0:38:32.800
And so we do need more people.

539
0:38:32.800 --> 0:38:37.560
We need more hands and more eyes and more brains with the diverse experiences to participate

540
0:38:37.560 --> 0:38:43.080
so we can ask the best questions and find the best solutions.

541
0:38:43.080 --> 0:38:47.740
And so someone had asked me on Macedon what would be the best way or how you can contribute

542
0:38:47.740 --> 0:38:54.400
to NASA open source and I wanted to actually share some of the different aspects.

543
0:38:54.400 --> 0:38:57.720
And so you can contribute directly to NASA open source code.

544
0:38:57.720 --> 0:39:00.040
It's available on GitHub.

545
0:39:00.040 --> 0:39:05.560
You can contribute to the open source software that's maintained by our partners at JPL or

546
0:39:05.560 --> 0:39:13.020
at Space Telescope or at the NASA Impact Project or the NASA DEVELOP Project or a wide range

547
0:39:13.020 --> 0:39:18.160
of different sources or at ESA and or at other groups that are actually contributing and

548
0:39:18.160 --> 0:39:20.240
answering scientific questions like CERN.

549
0:39:20.240 --> 0:39:25.920
So you can contribute directly to the open source code.

550
0:39:25.920 --> 0:39:30.560
But you can also keep contributing, building and sustaining your code.

551
0:39:30.560 --> 0:39:35.320
There's so much open source that NASA is using and so even just by participating in your

552
0:39:35.320 --> 0:39:41.580
own open source projects you're contributing to the NASA mission.

553
0:39:41.580 --> 0:39:43.960
And you can also come work with us.

554
0:39:43.960 --> 0:39:48.920
This can either be, you know, we're always hiring and also our partners and our contractors

555
0:39:48.920 --> 0:39:53.280
are always hiring and a lot of these are great places to work on open source.

556
0:39:53.280 --> 0:40:00.200
And so we also have great internship programs especially at NASA and at JPL and also always

557
0:40:00.200 --> 0:40:04.120
excited to have people come work with us or come work with our partners in Europe like

558
0:40:04.120 --> 0:40:06.400
the European Space Agency.

559
0:40:06.400 --> 0:40:11.160
We're always looking for great technical talent to help make contributions and help build

560
0:40:11.160 --> 0:40:14.480
our missions.

561
0:40:14.480 --> 0:40:21.180
And to help address these major questions that impact humanity and to have us help reach

562
0:40:21.180 --> 0:40:25.960
new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humanity.

563
0:40:25.960 --> 0:40:29.920
And whether or not we're asking questions of protect and improve life on Earth and space

564
0:40:29.920 --> 0:40:34.840
and trying to address questions around climate change, address questions around planetary

565
0:40:34.840 --> 0:40:40.780
protection, around questions around environmental justice.

566
0:40:40.780 --> 0:40:43.460
These are important questions that affect all of us.

567
0:40:43.460 --> 0:40:46.680
Whether or not we're searching for life elsewhere, either searching for life in our own solar

568
0:40:46.680 --> 0:40:52.200
system on Mars or Europa or Venus or searching for life around planets orbiting around other

569
0:40:52.200 --> 0:40:53.700
stars.

570
0:40:53.700 --> 0:40:57.400
And if we're trying to discover the secrets of the universe, trying to understand general

571
0:40:57.400 --> 0:41:03.320
relativity, trying to understand how our universe, our earliest galaxies have formed, trying

572
0:41:03.320 --> 0:41:06.180
to understand how black holes work.

573
0:41:06.180 --> 0:41:11.040
These are all the types of questions that we're trying to answer here at NASA.

574
0:41:11.040 --> 0:41:19.560
And so I just want to stop there and I'm almost at my end of my talk, but just actually want

575
0:41:19.560 --> 0:41:23.760
to end it with a little bit of audience participation.

576
0:41:23.760 --> 0:41:30.120
And so I do, if you did actually see during my talk software that you contributed to,

577
0:41:30.120 --> 0:41:33.840
can you raise your hand?

578
0:41:33.840 --> 0:41:38.760
So I mean, during my talk I could only show about 1% of the software out there.

579
0:41:38.760 --> 0:41:43.160
So if you actually know you actually contributed to some NASA software out there that's used

580
0:41:43.160 --> 0:41:46.440
by ESA or someone else, can you raise your hand?

581
0:41:46.440 --> 0:41:49.760
And you can see how many people are contributing to it.

582
0:41:49.760 --> 0:41:56.000
But as I said, there is even that wider range of software which is out there.

583
0:41:56.000 --> 0:42:01.720
And doing open source also means actually like being part of the community, which is

584
0:42:01.720 --> 0:42:08.960
actually developing guidance, developing licenses, growing the community, mentoring the community.

585
0:42:08.960 --> 0:42:13.080
And so if you're taking part in actually growing the open source community and governing the

586
0:42:13.080 --> 0:42:15.160
open source community, can you raise your hand?

587
0:42:15.160 --> 0:42:24.120
And so if you've been working on licenses and mentoring and inclusion, and for everyone

588
0:42:24.120 --> 0:42:29.640
else, for those who actually want to contribute, who want to actually help us explore the universe

589
0:42:29.640 --> 0:42:33.920
and help reveal the unknown.

590
0:42:33.920 --> 0:42:40.880
And so for all of you who are building, oh, I had one last one which was for those who

591
0:42:40.880 --> 0:42:45.440
helped volunteer and organized this conference so I could take my moment to share NASA's

592
0:42:45.440 --> 0:42:51.040
message with everyone, can you raise your hands for all those who volunteered because

593
0:42:51.040 --> 0:43:06.240
you're also helping with NASA's message.

594
0:43:06.240 --> 0:43:10.840
And so for everyone who raised your hand, I just really do want to say thank you for

595
0:43:10.840 --> 0:43:13.120
all of your contributions.

596
0:43:13.120 --> 0:43:14.240
Thank you for helping us out.

597
0:43:14.240 --> 0:43:19.680
And for those who will contribute in the future to open source and other projects, thank you

598
0:43:19.680 --> 0:43:21.800
for your future contributions.

599
0:43:21.800 --> 0:43:50.680
Thank you very much, everyone.
