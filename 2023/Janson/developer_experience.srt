0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.000
Hello, Fostum.

2
0:00:05.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Hi.

3
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:11.720
Wow, it's so good to be here.

4
0:00:11.720 --> 0:00:17.840
You are the heroes of Fostum because I am the closing act and you have come to see me.

5
0:00:17.840 --> 0:00:18.840
This is so good.

6
0:00:18.840 --> 0:00:21.000
Thank you very much for being here.

7
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:22.000
Six o'clock.

8
0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:23.240
Let's get the show on the road.

9
0:00:23.240 --> 0:00:28.800
I am from the Linux Foundation and I have the privilege of doing research on the open

10
0:00:28.800 --> 0:00:31.680
source ecosystem.

11
0:00:31.680 --> 0:00:38.040
I was brought in a couple of years ago to use data as a means to describe what is taking

12
0:00:38.040 --> 0:00:45.200
place across open source communities and to provide greater insight for the purposes of

13
0:00:45.200 --> 0:00:48.160
supporting all kinds of programs in the ecosystem.

14
0:00:48.160 --> 0:00:53.080
If you were here for Abigail's talk previously, a lot of what she had to say was to do with

15
0:00:53.080 --> 0:00:55.760
sustainability and funding projects.

16
0:00:55.760 --> 0:01:01.160
I am hopeful that the resource that we are creating at the Linux Foundation is the utility

17
0:01:01.160 --> 0:01:06.480
that will help support grants and funding for otherwise non-commercial open source projects,

18
0:01:06.480 --> 0:01:10.800
especially those that are contributing to sustainability.

19
0:01:10.800 --> 0:01:13.480
So that's the perspective that I come from.

20
0:01:13.480 --> 0:01:18.000
We want to investigate the impact of open source projects through research.

21
0:01:18.000 --> 0:01:24.400
We conduct our research through quantitative and qualitative methodologies, surveys, interviews,

22
0:01:24.400 --> 0:01:27.960
and empirical research.

23
0:01:27.960 --> 0:01:34.040
We create this resource, co-create it with the community, we create it by the community,

24
0:01:34.040 --> 0:01:35.800
and we give it back to the community.

25
0:01:35.800 --> 0:01:40.040
The reports are all published under Creative Commons.

26
0:01:40.040 --> 0:01:41.520
You don't have to give your email.

27
0:01:41.520 --> 0:01:44.240
We're not going to spam you for reading them.

28
0:01:44.240 --> 0:01:47.880
So they're a resource for everybody to leverage.

29
0:01:47.880 --> 0:01:49.640
So check us out.

30
0:01:49.640 --> 0:01:50.640
This is our homepage.

31
0:01:50.640 --> 0:01:54.960
We're going to scan and discover the publications that we produce today.

32
0:01:54.960 --> 0:01:59.560
We have 26 publications in just shy of two years on a whole variety of topics that I'll

33
0:01:59.560 --> 0:02:00.560
get into.

34
0:02:00.560 --> 0:02:07.040
And the Linux Foundation has a history of doing some important research in open source.

35
0:02:07.040 --> 0:02:13.560
Not that long ago, they published the Linux kernel report, the Linux kernel history report,

36
0:02:13.560 --> 0:02:19.200
as well as the 2020 FOSS contributor survey in collaboration with Harvard's Laboratory

37
0:02:19.200 --> 0:02:26.040
of Innovation Science, which was a deep dive into understanding contributor motivations,

38
0:02:26.040 --> 0:02:27.040
opportunities and challenges.

39
0:02:27.040 --> 0:02:30.600
So if you haven't seen either of those reports, I'd encourage you to check them out.

40
0:02:30.600 --> 0:02:39.080
The 26 reports we've done today are across a number of different frameworks.

41
0:02:39.080 --> 0:02:43.880
It's really tough to package up open source conceptually and do a bunch of research to

42
0:02:43.880 --> 0:02:45.400
say how are we going to organize this.

43
0:02:45.400 --> 0:02:52.640
So we set about, actually, before I get down that path, a quick example of some recent

44
0:02:52.640 --> 0:02:56.840
reports that you'll find at the top of our website include mentorship and open source,

45
0:02:56.840 --> 0:03:03.040
which also plays into Abigail's speech about sustainability and the role of mentorship

46
0:03:03.040 --> 0:03:09.960
programs, enabling collaboration across open source communities all around the world.

47
0:03:09.960 --> 0:03:11.280
How do we enhance collaboration?

48
0:03:11.280 --> 0:03:12.800
How do we break down silos?

49
0:03:12.800 --> 0:03:14.560
And how do we reduce fragmentation?

50
0:03:14.560 --> 0:03:20.680
Industry reports like the 2022 state of open source in financial services takes a deep

51
0:03:20.680 --> 0:03:23.040
dive in an industry sector.

52
0:03:23.040 --> 0:03:31.080
And for our friends at the SOTA Foundation, hello, Stephen Tan, the 2022 data and storage

53
0:03:31.080 --> 0:03:32.240
trends report.

54
0:03:32.240 --> 0:03:36.960
So just a quick highlight of four recent publications that have come out.

55
0:03:36.960 --> 0:03:43.240
We've got great stuff coming down the pike as well, looking at the idea of open source

56
0:03:43.240 --> 0:03:44.520
for digital wallets.

57
0:03:44.520 --> 0:03:47.120
Why do we need an open source digital wallet infrastructure?

58
0:03:47.120 --> 0:03:51.040
Well essentially we have centralization in the wallet community right now through Google

59
0:03:51.040 --> 0:03:53.040
Pay and Apple Pay.

60
0:03:53.040 --> 0:03:57.560
We're creating infrastructure through an open source foundation that's going to create opportunities

61
0:03:57.560 --> 0:04:05.320
for any organization to build a secure digital asset infrastructure.

62
0:04:05.320 --> 0:04:12.360
Web 3 and sustainability, looking at some of the challenges around blockchain and how

63
0:04:12.360 --> 0:04:17.640
we can reduce the environmental and carbon impact of blockchain and how blockchains can

64
0:04:17.640 --> 0:04:23.960
reduce our own through providing secure data sets and perhaps incentives, real monetary

65
0:04:23.960 --> 0:04:29.480
tokens for us to change our behavior and start making sustainable choices and be rewarded

66
0:04:29.480 --> 0:04:31.000
for them.

67
0:04:31.000 --> 0:04:37.360
Be rewarded for buying the carbon neutral product and use the token to ride public transit.

68
0:04:37.360 --> 0:04:40.320
But you can't use the token to put gas in your car.

69
0:04:40.320 --> 0:04:45.160
That's an example of the economies that are coming down the road.

70
0:04:45.160 --> 0:04:47.360
And our deliverables.

71
0:04:47.360 --> 0:04:50.440
Everything we do is available under Creative Commons.

72
0:04:50.440 --> 0:04:56.240
We publish our data sets, our survey data that is free of personally identifiable information.

73
0:04:56.240 --> 0:05:03.640
And we do so on data.world, data repository essentially, not on like GitHub, but a little

74
0:05:03.640 --> 0:05:09.900
bit more accessible for the non-coder to be able to find our data sets.

75
0:05:09.900 --> 0:05:14.400
And if you want to play around with our data and create your own analysis, go to data.world,

76
0:05:14.400 --> 0:05:20.080
check out the Linux foundation data sets and feel free to explore some of our survey data

77
0:05:20.080 --> 0:05:21.080
and see what you come up with.

78
0:05:21.080 --> 0:05:22.080
Let us know.

79
0:05:22.080 --> 0:05:25.320
If you find something different, we'd love to hear from you.

80
0:05:25.320 --> 0:05:27.960
We produce reports, infographics and so on.

81
0:05:27.960 --> 0:05:33.900
So check out these resources and if there's a way that you can use them to support your

82
0:05:33.900 --> 0:05:35.800
project communities, go for it.

83
0:05:35.800 --> 0:05:38.600
And let us know how you make out.

84
0:05:38.600 --> 0:05:42.640
So the first way we conduct research is on geographic lines.

85
0:05:42.640 --> 0:05:47.160
We think that there's some unique trends taking place in different regions around the world.

86
0:05:47.160 --> 0:05:52.460
And what's happening in Europe that might be different from North America?

87
0:05:52.460 --> 0:05:53.480
Is there different culture?

88
0:05:53.480 --> 0:05:56.600
Are there different opportunities?

89
0:05:56.600 --> 0:05:57.600
And what's going on?

90
0:05:57.600 --> 0:06:00.320
The first report we published was last year, our Europe spotlight.

91
0:06:00.320 --> 0:06:06.480
So if you're interested in how European open source communities are taking advantage of

92
0:06:06.480 --> 0:06:11.200
the open source opportunity or not, give this report a read.

93
0:06:11.200 --> 0:06:13.700
It's got some pretty interesting insights.

94
0:06:13.700 --> 0:06:16.780
Second way we go about conducting research is long industry analysis.

95
0:06:16.780 --> 0:06:21.680
So if your project is specific to a certain industry, whether it's maybe it's film and

96
0:06:21.680 --> 0:06:28.520
entertainment, maybe it's financial services, maybe it's energy, our research is very focused

97
0:06:28.520 --> 0:06:31.760
sometimes on industry specific open source projects.

98
0:06:31.760 --> 0:06:34.240
The energy example is really exciting.

99
0:06:34.240 --> 0:06:40.640
And the more that regulators know about open source projects in an energy vertical, the

100
0:06:40.640 --> 0:06:44.780
better, because we need to transition off of older infrastructure.

101
0:06:44.780 --> 0:06:48.040
And open source is the path to doing that.

102
0:06:48.040 --> 0:06:53.120
One example of an industry project is in motion pictures industry with the Academy Software

103
0:06:53.120 --> 0:06:54.920
Foundation.

104
0:06:54.920 --> 0:07:02.800
Many of the projects that were used to create the Academy nine time nominated film Dune

105
0:07:02.800 --> 0:07:05.120
is built with open source software.

106
0:07:05.120 --> 0:07:09.320
And we host nine projects at the Academy Software Foundation.

107
0:07:09.320 --> 0:07:14.280
And this research report tells the story of how it was formed and what needs to happen

108
0:07:14.280 --> 0:07:19.520
in that community to keep it sustainable where the challenges are.

109
0:07:19.520 --> 0:07:22.680
Technology horizontal is another way we approach our research.

110
0:07:22.680 --> 0:07:25.440
Recent example being resiliency in cloud.

111
0:07:25.440 --> 0:07:30.280
How do we achieve multi cloud resiliency?

112
0:07:30.280 --> 0:07:34.680
We did this with cloud data computing foundation and it was a result of a round table we hosted

113
0:07:34.680 --> 0:07:37.520
at KubeCon in Valencia.

114
0:07:37.520 --> 0:07:41.280
And finally, and this is where the developer community comes into play, you'll see at the

115
0:07:41.280 --> 0:07:51.360
top of this graphic is the developer contributor framework to view open source opportunities.

116
0:07:51.360 --> 0:07:56.720
What are the issues specific to developers, to maintainers, to sustainability, to diversity

117
0:07:56.720 --> 0:08:03.120
equity inclusion, leadership, racial and social justice, and so on.

118
0:08:03.120 --> 0:08:08.040
So we've got a lot of reports that don't fall neatly into a tech horizontal or an industry

119
0:08:08.040 --> 0:08:15.400
vertical or a geographic framework, but they apply the whole ecosystem.

120
0:08:15.400 --> 0:08:17.040
Recent example DEI.

121
0:08:17.040 --> 0:08:22.160
I happen to coauthor this one with a woman named Jessica Groupman.

122
0:08:22.160 --> 0:08:27.640
And it really talks about the good, the bad and the ugly about diversity issues across

123
0:08:27.640 --> 0:08:31.880
open source project communities and how we can collectively work together to address

124
0:08:31.880 --> 0:08:34.320
some of the challenges.

125
0:08:34.320 --> 0:08:39.000
But importantly we've got more and more work coming that is focused on the developer and

126
0:08:39.000 --> 0:08:40.760
maintainer experience.

127
0:08:40.760 --> 0:08:48.520
And it is very, very important that we continue to explore the issues so that we can provide

128
0:08:48.520 --> 0:08:53.640
better programming and resourcing to support our developer community.

129
0:08:53.640 --> 0:08:55.360
How do we ensure sustainable projects?

130
0:08:55.360 --> 0:08:57.560
How do we ensure diverse projects?

131
0:08:57.560 --> 0:08:59.740
How do we ensure funding?

132
0:08:59.740 --> 0:09:04.080
How do we incentivize developers to implement security best practices?

133
0:09:04.080 --> 0:09:08.920
And we find the answers to these questions through research.

134
0:09:08.920 --> 0:09:15.440
And today I'm going to share some of the insights that have come across the 26 projects that

135
0:09:15.440 --> 0:09:21.080
we've done to date in all different ways that have some story to tell about the developer

136
0:09:21.080 --> 0:09:22.080
experience.

137
0:09:22.080 --> 0:09:27.880
So this is what this collection of next slides is all about.

138
0:09:27.880 --> 0:09:32.720
Devs are having a really good time doing what they're doing.

139
0:09:32.720 --> 0:09:37.320
Many projects that we've done have said that open source development is fun.

140
0:09:37.320 --> 0:09:43.400
And like time and time and time again, this is almost a universal truth that people are

141
0:09:43.400 --> 0:09:48.960
here because they find it a stimulating and rewarding place to be.

142
0:09:48.960 --> 0:09:51.760
And that's kind of exciting.

143
0:09:51.760 --> 0:09:52.760
It's great.

144
0:09:52.760 --> 0:09:57.000
And it's probably why open source projects are so prolific.

145
0:09:57.000 --> 0:10:00.440
People enjoy contributing code.

146
0:10:00.440 --> 0:10:07.080
Out of our Europe study, fun really is a leading motivation here, much more so than, say, career

147
0:10:07.080 --> 0:10:09.240
development.

148
0:10:09.240 --> 0:10:16.160
We concluded that, and also through interviews, that there's sort of a romantic thing going

149
0:10:16.160 --> 0:10:20.020
on in Europe that is less prevalent in other geographic regions.

150
0:10:20.020 --> 0:10:28.640
And it really is around doing good, creating solutions that have a purpose.

151
0:10:28.640 --> 0:10:36.560
And there's a strong motivation for learning and fun in this community.

152
0:10:36.560 --> 0:10:43.080
Open source is also an incredibly empowering space for our respondents, the majority of

153
0:10:43.080 --> 0:10:50.800
whom are developers, that the opportunity to create infrastructure, to create projects

154
0:10:50.800 --> 0:11:00.600
that have intrinsic value for a region that allow for sovereignty, that allow us to not

155
0:11:00.600 --> 0:11:04.640
be reliant on certain vendors.

156
0:11:04.640 --> 0:11:07.680
And this is a really motivating factor.

157
0:11:07.680 --> 0:11:14.200
And being in this space is an incredibly empowering and rewarding activity.

158
0:11:14.200 --> 0:11:18.940
We have an opportunity to change the world if we don't like it.

159
0:11:18.940 --> 0:11:24.040
What's fascinating is the extent to which developers are taking a personal interest

160
0:11:24.040 --> 0:11:25.040
in their work.

161
0:11:25.040 --> 0:11:27.240
They show up because they care.

162
0:11:27.240 --> 0:11:33.200
And really, without that personal attachment and intrinsic motivation, we just wouldn't

163
0:11:33.200 --> 0:11:37.400
be where we are, especially when we consider how many projects do not have funding.

164
0:11:37.400 --> 0:11:40.840
And they are not part of a commercial ecosystem.

165
0:11:40.840 --> 0:11:46.960
So this motivation keeps these projects going.

166
0:11:46.960 --> 0:11:53.200
The other side of this coin is that if there's a loss of motivation of some kind, if there's

167
0:11:53.200 --> 0:11:57.240
the feeling of sudden apathy, then a project can just be shelved and somebody can sign

168
0:11:57.240 --> 0:11:59.200
off and say, I'm out.

169
0:11:59.200 --> 0:12:00.920
So that is a risk that we face.

170
0:12:00.920 --> 0:12:06.760
And we've seen examples of that recently, though I couldn't name the specific project.

171
0:12:06.760 --> 0:12:11.760
You hear about people having a change of heart.

172
0:12:11.760 --> 0:12:14.160
Training is also something that's incredibly important.

173
0:12:14.160 --> 0:12:22.980
As new technologies are emerging, as security is becoming increasingly important, organizations

174
0:12:22.980 --> 0:12:28.700
are looking for highly skilled, highly trained, open source software developers.

175
0:12:28.700 --> 0:12:35.160
And the skills that they're looking for now have eclipsed Linux as a focus point.

176
0:12:35.160 --> 0:12:41.820
Skills are sought after in cloud, in DevOps, in security, and yes, very much so in Linux.

177
0:12:41.820 --> 0:12:50.680
But we're also seeing new projects emerging in Metaverse, in AI, PyTorch being an example.

178
0:12:50.680 --> 0:12:59.160
So training is very much in demand, and fortunately there are good resources available that are

179
0:12:59.160 --> 0:13:00.400
often free.

180
0:13:00.400 --> 0:13:03.640
We host many of them at the Linux Foundation, so check them out.

181
0:13:03.640 --> 0:13:08.320
The other bit of good news is that employers, if you're fortunate enough to be in a situation

182
0:13:08.320 --> 0:13:13.440
where you're paid to contribute, companies are paying for training.

183
0:13:13.440 --> 0:13:19.840
90% of hiring managers will say, we'll hire you, come here, and we will pay to skill you

184
0:13:19.840 --> 0:13:21.360
up.

185
0:13:21.360 --> 0:13:29.120
And the reason being, not only the hiring managers, but within organizations, we can't

186
0:13:29.120 --> 0:13:33.080
necessarily hire our way out of digital challenges.

187
0:13:33.080 --> 0:13:38.880
We have to sometimes work with the talent pools that we have and train our team members.

188
0:13:38.880 --> 0:13:42.760
Because it's incredibly costly to go out and pay a developer who you think has the right

189
0:13:42.760 --> 0:13:46.280
skills only for them to leave and go to a competitor.

190
0:13:46.280 --> 0:13:54.880
So training a resource in-house seems to be a trend that we're seeing specific to devs.

191
0:13:54.880 --> 0:13:59.840
And fortunately everyone in this room is in a really good position because the demand

192
0:13:59.840 --> 0:14:09.280
for your skills exceeds the supply of skilled people available to provide the service.

193
0:14:09.280 --> 0:14:11.960
You're in a very, very good space right now.

194
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:16.360
Because industries are becoming increasingly software defined, you are calling all the

195
0:14:16.360 --> 0:14:17.840
shots.

196
0:14:17.840 --> 0:14:22.740
So leverage it to your advantage.

197
0:14:22.740 --> 0:14:26.040
Sometimes there are barriers that prevent you from doing the things that you really

198
0:14:26.040 --> 0:14:27.040
want to do.

199
0:14:27.040 --> 0:14:28.040
I'll give you an example.

200
0:14:28.040 --> 0:14:29.040
You work in an industry full-time.

201
0:14:29.040 --> 0:14:31.080
You have a paid job.

202
0:14:31.080 --> 0:14:34.800
It's in a highly regulated industry, like financial services.

203
0:14:34.800 --> 0:14:43.040
And the company policy says that, sorry, not only can you not contribute to projects on

204
0:14:43.040 --> 0:14:49.800
behalf of the organization and open source that might be beneficial, but you also can't

205
0:14:49.800 --> 0:14:53.840
contribute to projects in your personal time.

206
0:14:53.840 --> 0:14:57.940
And that's a barrier that industry needs to figure out how to solve.

207
0:14:57.940 --> 0:15:00.820
Because it is ultimately to their detriment.

208
0:15:00.820 --> 0:15:05.560
And the regulatory community, particularly in certain verticals, has to come to terms

209
0:15:05.560 --> 0:15:11.120
with the realities of the way open source is developed and not put up so many barriers

210
0:15:11.120 --> 0:15:14.400
that are non-threatening.

211
0:15:14.400 --> 0:15:20.400
I'm thinking of community chat rooms on a repo within financial services and the SEC

212
0:15:20.400 --> 0:15:28.300
freaking out in case regulatory policies were being breached in any kind of activity.

213
0:15:28.300 --> 0:15:36.800
The other barriers for certain types of industries are around access to Slack or access, even

214
0:15:36.800 --> 0:15:37.800
SurveyMonkey.

215
0:15:37.800 --> 0:15:38.840
We do surveys.

216
0:15:38.840 --> 0:15:42.960
Really challenging to try to get data through some corporate firewalls.

217
0:15:42.960 --> 0:15:46.480
So there are non-tariff barriers.

218
0:15:46.480 --> 0:15:48.200
Security.

219
0:15:48.200 --> 0:15:50.480
Very, very important.

220
0:15:50.480 --> 0:15:54.920
And there are lots of tools out there that can help developers better understand dependencies.

221
0:15:54.920 --> 0:16:02.360
And the number one benefit, it's the number one benefit of producing S-POMs.

222
0:16:02.360 --> 0:16:09.760
Better understanding the dependencies in your projects.

223
0:16:09.760 --> 0:16:12.200
Here is a truth.

224
0:16:12.200 --> 0:16:17.800
And I think, I don't know if anyone here would disagree, but devs are pretty amazing project

225
0:16:17.800 --> 0:16:19.400
ambassadors.

226
0:16:19.400 --> 0:16:26.880
Carol Payne from Netflix speaks publicly and often about the projects she contributes to,

227
0:16:26.880 --> 0:16:34.920
inspires other people to get involved, helps recruiting new developers to projects.

228
0:16:34.920 --> 0:16:39.440
And she feels that she has a responsibility to do that.

229
0:16:39.440 --> 0:16:44.080
And we see so many devs advocating because it's the right thing to do.

230
0:16:44.080 --> 0:16:48.680
And it's incredible to building a community.

231
0:16:48.680 --> 0:16:53.600
For all of those of you who are ambassadors for your project, keep up the good work.

232
0:16:53.600 --> 0:16:54.600
Make such a difference.

233
0:16:54.600 --> 0:17:02.920
And it's so nice to see people being the champion of one project or another.

234
0:17:02.920 --> 0:17:05.640
Open source development in particular has its benefits.

235
0:17:05.640 --> 0:17:15.000
I recently gave a talk to an organization that had a lot of people just working in a

236
0:17:15.000 --> 0:17:16.540
closed source environment.

237
0:17:16.540 --> 0:17:22.280
They are not necessarily aware of what the benefit is to working in open source.

238
0:17:22.280 --> 0:17:26.640
And of course everyone here knows that you have the opportunity to learn from others

239
0:17:26.640 --> 0:17:28.560
and build on the work of others.

240
0:17:28.560 --> 0:17:30.560
You don't actually have to go it alone.

241
0:17:30.560 --> 0:17:36.000
There's so much less pressure and less stress and tremendous upside.

242
0:17:36.000 --> 0:17:39.720
But these truths are not necessarily widely known.

243
0:17:39.720 --> 0:17:44.280
So that's what I have to do is say, look, these are great places, great spaces.

244
0:17:44.280 --> 0:17:45.280
There's a lot of benefit.

245
0:17:45.280 --> 0:17:47.440
Open source is a good thing.

246
0:17:47.440 --> 0:17:49.360
Take advantage of the opportunities.

247
0:17:49.360 --> 0:17:55.400
I am a different kind of ambassador telling the story about why open source actually works

248
0:17:55.400 --> 0:17:58.800
and what the value proposition is.

249
0:17:58.800 --> 0:18:06.360
And devs mitigate risk by this very openness, by accepting external viewpoints.

250
0:18:06.360 --> 0:18:09.880
One of the things that I had to come to terms with when I started working for the Linux

251
0:18:09.880 --> 0:18:16.720
Foundation is the open sourcing of the research development process.

252
0:18:16.720 --> 0:18:23.240
Having so many eyes on a research paper before it gets published, that was like a shock to

253
0:18:23.240 --> 0:18:24.240
me.

254
0:18:24.240 --> 0:18:29.960
But because of the culture I am in at the Linux Foundation, I work with incredibly smart

255
0:18:29.960 --> 0:18:34.680
people and a whole bunch of different disciplines.

256
0:18:34.680 --> 0:18:38.520
They are all weighing in on my report.

257
0:18:38.520 --> 0:18:45.320
And I'll tell you something, I've never had such high quality research as a consequence.

258
0:18:45.320 --> 0:18:46.840
People genuinely care.

259
0:18:46.840 --> 0:18:51.160
Not necessarily in their job description, but they are weighing in on a document because

260
0:18:51.160 --> 0:18:52.960
they can.

261
0:18:52.960 --> 0:18:53.960
And so they do.

262
0:18:53.960 --> 0:18:56.920
And they genuinely want to make something better.

263
0:18:56.920 --> 0:19:02.600
So my experience is that this methodology really, really works to create high quality

264
0:19:02.600 --> 0:19:04.560
outcomes.

265
0:19:04.560 --> 0:19:06.520
Definitely onto something here.

266
0:19:06.520 --> 0:19:11.640
And yes, devs can further mitigate risk by taking personal responsibility of implementing

267
0:19:11.640 --> 0:19:18.320
security best practices, including the increasing use of multi-factor authentication tokens

268
0:19:18.320 --> 0:19:23.560
to increase greater account security.

269
0:19:23.560 --> 0:19:29.480
So we're spreading the word about how we can improve the security of software supply chains.

270
0:19:29.480 --> 0:19:31.040
What are the tools available?

271
0:19:31.040 --> 0:19:34.920
What resources do you need?

272
0:19:34.920 --> 0:19:37.920
We're really just getting started here.

273
0:19:37.920 --> 0:19:46.320
This particular factoid came from the report we published this year with the Laboratory

274
0:19:46.320 --> 0:19:51.240
of Innovation Science from Harvard, which was Census 2.

275
0:19:51.240 --> 0:20:00.480
Looking at essentially three software composition analysis firms, SNEAK, FOSSA and Synopsys,

276
0:20:00.480 --> 0:20:08.200
ran scans to identify the most commonly used application libraries so that we could have

277
0:20:08.200 --> 0:20:09.200
a measure.

278
0:20:09.200 --> 0:20:14.040
It's not a perfect measure, but it is a measure of the most popular software.

279
0:20:14.040 --> 0:20:20.800
So if we know what the most widely used applications are, we can prioritize our efforts to secure

280
0:20:20.800 --> 0:20:22.120
them.

281
0:20:22.120 --> 0:20:24.480
That's the rationale behind some of the research we're doing.

282
0:20:24.480 --> 0:20:31.080
And that's where this particular point came from.

283
0:20:31.080 --> 0:20:35.960
And yes, you shoulder a lot of responsibility.

284
0:20:35.960 --> 0:20:43.000
The FOSS, Census 2 validated, again, that the most widely used free and open source

285
0:20:43.000 --> 0:20:48.720
software is developed by only a handful of contributors.

286
0:20:48.720 --> 0:20:56.240
In one dataset, 136 were responsible for more than 80% of the lines of code added to the

287
0:20:56.240 --> 0:21:00.660
top 50 packages.

288
0:21:00.660 --> 0:21:02.400
So how do we share that responsibility?

289
0:21:02.400 --> 0:21:05.240
I don't know, but we're working on it.

290
0:21:05.240 --> 0:21:09.320
If you have ideas, that's what we're here for.

291
0:21:09.320 --> 0:21:19.840
I want everybody here to take away the opportunity that research through the LF is a mechanism

292
0:21:19.840 --> 0:21:23.600
for you to be heard.

293
0:21:23.600 --> 0:21:30.000
If a stat seems wrong or, you know, if you have an opinion, let's hear your opinion.

294
0:21:30.000 --> 0:21:38.860
We would love nothing more than to hear from you so as to change programming and resourcing

295
0:21:38.860 --> 0:21:41.620
that will better support you.

296
0:21:41.620 --> 0:21:48.480
So let this be your mechanism to share your perspectives and knowledge.

297
0:21:48.480 --> 0:21:50.360
Toxicity and open source is real.

298
0:21:50.360 --> 0:21:58.280
It came through our, it was real before we did research on it, but one in five open source

299
0:21:58.280 --> 0:22:04.400
devs have been discriminated or felt unwelcome or professionals, I should say.

300
0:22:04.400 --> 0:22:13.320
And it is minority groups that are most acutely affected.

301
0:22:13.320 --> 0:22:20.040
The minority populations of our community really struggle in not feeling welcome and

302
0:22:20.040 --> 0:22:22.160
open source.

303
0:22:22.160 --> 0:22:23.680
And why is this such an issue?

304
0:22:23.680 --> 0:22:28.440
Well, it's really important because diverse technologies are better technologies.

305
0:22:28.440 --> 0:22:30.240
Diversity creates better tech.

306
0:22:30.240 --> 0:22:34.460
For the longest time, I'm from Canada, by the way, and we have a thing called postal codes

307
0:22:34.460 --> 0:22:40.860
which differ from zip codes and they differ from European postal codes as well.

308
0:22:40.860 --> 0:22:49.160
But because we're so often filling out forms specific to the United States, I'd like those

309
0:22:49.160 --> 0:22:52.240
forms to have an extra space where I can put my postal code in.

310
0:22:52.240 --> 0:22:55.640
Because that's just, you know, a technology frustration.

311
0:22:55.640 --> 0:23:02.480
If the designer of a form realized that they need more than zip codes for inclusion, like

312
0:23:02.480 --> 0:23:05.280
let's include the Canadians, that's great.

313
0:23:05.280 --> 0:23:06.840
That's how you get better technology.

314
0:23:06.840 --> 0:23:14.860
Think outside your lane and you increase opportunities for others to participate.

315
0:23:14.860 --> 0:23:16.360
And Rachel Rose from ILM.

316
0:23:16.360 --> 0:23:23.400
ILM is the Lucasfilm production unit.

317
0:23:23.400 --> 0:23:29.240
So Industrial Light and Magic is making all the Star Wars stuff and making some pretty

318
0:23:29.240 --> 0:23:34.720
good films with open source software.

319
0:23:34.720 --> 0:23:39.080
And nobody says it better when we have people with varied backgrounds and opinions, we get

320
0:23:39.080 --> 0:23:40.080
better software.

321
0:23:40.080 --> 0:23:42.320
Thank you, Rachel.

322
0:23:42.320 --> 0:23:48.440
We've got upcoming research that's very specific to maintainers because of the responsibility

323
0:23:48.440 --> 0:23:51.560
that is shouldered on maintainers.

324
0:23:51.560 --> 0:24:01.000
And what we did before I jump into this particular point, after we published the second census

325
0:24:01.000 --> 0:24:04.920
report, census 2, that was scanning those application libraries to identify the most

326
0:24:04.920 --> 0:24:11.860
popular software, we tried to reach as many of those maintainers we could to have a conversation

327
0:24:11.860 --> 0:24:14.020
with them and say what is going on?

328
0:24:14.020 --> 0:24:15.020
What do you need?

329
0:24:15.020 --> 0:24:16.020
What are your challenges?

330
0:24:16.020 --> 0:24:17.020
What are your constraints?

331
0:24:17.020 --> 0:24:18.160
How's it going?

332
0:24:18.160 --> 0:24:20.400
Do you have a successor?

333
0:24:20.400 --> 0:24:22.100
What was your pathway to here?

334
0:24:22.100 --> 0:24:23.500
Are you paid?

335
0:24:23.500 --> 0:24:25.480
How much time is on your hands?

336
0:24:25.480 --> 0:24:31.080
And it is this methodology that is producing the next couple of slides.

337
0:24:31.080 --> 0:24:32.960
This report is still in development.

338
0:24:32.960 --> 0:24:35.480
We've got a really solid draft.

339
0:24:35.480 --> 0:24:41.640
But we will be publishing these insights at some point in the quarter.

340
0:24:41.640 --> 0:24:48.120
So really excited to get a window into the world of the maintainers of some of the most

341
0:24:48.120 --> 0:24:50.720
critical software in the world.

342
0:24:50.720 --> 0:25:00.600
And great quote that maintainership can fill an infinite amount of time if you let it.

343
0:25:00.600 --> 0:25:01.900
And that's true.

344
0:25:01.900 --> 0:25:03.640
Sometimes I feel that way about the Linux foundation.

345
0:25:03.640 --> 0:25:07.140
The more I give to the Linux foundation, the more it takes from me.

346
0:25:07.140 --> 0:25:12.680
But it's a gift that you give and you get so much back in return.

347
0:25:12.680 --> 0:25:19.520
I think this is true for maintainers, that they're just giving, giving, giving.

348
0:25:19.520 --> 0:25:22.880
That repo is always going to take it.

349
0:25:22.880 --> 0:25:23.880
Maintainers need tools.

350
0:25:23.880 --> 0:25:26.800
They need hacks.

351
0:25:26.800 --> 0:25:33.960
They need productivity tools that is going to improve their workflows.

352
0:25:33.960 --> 0:25:44.520
44% of developers want their employers to provide these artifacts, sandboxes and resources

353
0:25:44.520 --> 0:25:48.600
and things that help them do their jobs better.

354
0:25:48.600 --> 0:25:51.160
And money, though, is incredibly important.

355
0:25:51.160 --> 0:25:55.400
And Abigail's talk emphasized the need for funding.

356
0:25:55.400 --> 0:25:57.240
People have to eat.

357
0:25:57.240 --> 0:26:02.200
It is not the primary motivator for people to work on open source software projects.

358
0:26:02.200 --> 0:26:07.280
So it's not maintainer constraints and challenges.

359
0:26:07.280 --> 0:26:10.000
It's not something that money necessarily solves.

360
0:26:10.000 --> 0:26:13.000
Money can't buy me more hours in my day.

361
0:26:13.000 --> 0:26:17.480
And it can't buy me sustainable legacy for my work.

362
0:26:17.480 --> 0:26:23.080
We need to approach things differently outside of financial terms alone.

363
0:26:23.080 --> 0:26:24.760
It is part of the equation.

364
0:26:24.760 --> 0:26:30.480
But it's not the motivating factor.

365
0:26:30.480 --> 0:26:33.520
And yeah, maintainership is very often a job.

366
0:26:33.520 --> 0:26:34.840
It is not a hobby.

367
0:26:34.840 --> 0:26:39.920
And the pressure for maintainers is to build features and not fix bugs.

368
0:26:39.920 --> 0:26:45.360
And that's an equation that we need to change and figure out how we do it when we have a

369
0:26:45.360 --> 0:26:50.200
community that is so constrained in terms of time.

370
0:26:50.200 --> 0:26:54.680
How do we motivate intrinsically what tools do we need to provide?

371
0:26:54.680 --> 0:27:03.240
We're hoping to answer more of these types of questions as we continue to do more research.

372
0:27:03.240 --> 0:27:05.320
So yes, please get involved.

373
0:27:05.320 --> 0:27:06.920
Get involved.

374
0:27:06.920 --> 0:27:11.280
Research is just a different kind of open source contribution.

375
0:27:11.280 --> 0:27:12.280
We issue badges.

376
0:27:12.280 --> 0:27:18.480
If you contribute to a research project, either by way of writing a forward or doing a peer

377
0:27:18.480 --> 0:27:23.840
review of a survey before it's published, maybe you're going to localize the survey

378
0:27:23.840 --> 0:27:31.120
to Japanese or Chinese or German or French, we've got an opportunity for you to get involved

379
0:27:31.120 --> 0:27:35.000
in this output.

380
0:27:35.000 --> 0:27:41.040
And there's nothing I love more than when Phil Holleran from GitHub shares his badge

381
0:27:41.040 --> 0:27:45.800
on LinkedIn and says, it was great to be a contributor to research.

382
0:27:45.800 --> 0:27:47.840
It was really, really rewarding.

383
0:27:47.840 --> 0:27:51.080
And it was as rewarding for me to work with Phil.

384
0:27:51.080 --> 0:27:53.360
I have enjoyed this experience immensely.

385
0:27:53.360 --> 0:28:00.320
I've learned so much in my two years of doing research for the LF and working with people

386
0:28:00.320 --> 0:28:07.760
all across the ecosystem from industry to community organizations.

387
0:28:07.760 --> 0:28:09.360
I come from the blockchain space.

388
0:28:09.360 --> 0:28:14.320
I did blockchain research previously, but I really do love the open source community.

389
0:28:14.320 --> 0:28:17.040
It's a great place.

390
0:28:17.040 --> 0:28:21.880
I would love nothing more for you all to sign up and receive our newsletter and to learn

391
0:28:21.880 --> 0:28:26.160
about opportunities to get more involved, to take surveys.

392
0:28:26.160 --> 0:28:31.920
This year we're going to launch a panel and hope to get as many people on that panel as

393
0:28:31.920 --> 0:28:38.280
possible so as to create better insight and to be given the opportunity to answer surveys

394
0:28:38.280 --> 0:28:42.840
and tell us what's going on, tell us how to fix it.

395
0:28:42.840 --> 0:28:44.880
So please stay in touch with us.

396
0:28:44.880 --> 0:28:49.560
We're going to have more news on the development of our survey panel this year.

397
0:28:49.560 --> 0:28:53.000
That's my mandate to create it.

398
0:28:53.000 --> 0:28:58.080
And I'd love nothing more than for you to be a part of it.

399
0:28:58.080 --> 0:28:59.720
And with that, thank you very much.

400
0:28:59.720 --> 0:29:04.480
I'll be very happy to try to answer your questions.

401
0:29:04.480 --> 0:29:06.480
Thank you.

402
0:29:06.480 --> 0:29:10.840
Thank you, Larry.

403
0:29:10.840 --> 0:29:18.160
We have questions.

404
0:29:18.160 --> 0:29:20.160
Questions?

405
0:29:20.160 --> 0:29:22.160
Sure.

406
0:29:22.160 --> 0:29:24.160
Yes.

407
0:29:24.160 --> 0:29:26.520
I will move to the slide, this one.

408
0:29:26.520 --> 0:29:37.640
Thank you.

409
0:29:37.640 --> 0:29:43.240
You showed us some statistics there which I found really interesting.

410
0:29:43.240 --> 0:29:47.280
What's the most surprising thing that's come out of research that you've done or worked

411
0:29:47.280 --> 0:29:49.400
on with Linux Foundation?

412
0:29:49.400 --> 0:29:52.640
Wow, that is a great question.

413
0:29:52.640 --> 0:30:01.480
What is the most surprising thing that I've learned through research?

414
0:30:01.480 --> 0:30:03.360
I am surprised every single day.

415
0:30:03.360 --> 0:30:05.800
Honestly, I learn so much every day.

416
0:30:05.800 --> 0:30:09.520
I'm humbled by the amount that I learn.

417
0:30:09.520 --> 0:30:19.120
I think what's fascinating is the community aspect of open source.

418
0:30:19.120 --> 0:30:27.240
And that this is a community by people that without community, we would not have this

419
0:30:27.240 --> 0:30:28.800
technology infrastructure.

420
0:30:28.800 --> 0:30:34.120
I think that's the most fascinating and inspiring thing that I have learned.

421
0:30:34.120 --> 0:30:35.920
It's really wonderful.

422
0:30:35.920 --> 0:30:36.920
Thanks.

423
0:30:36.920 --> 0:30:41.640
Thank you for your question.

424
0:30:41.640 --> 0:30:42.960
More questions?

425
0:30:42.960 --> 0:30:46.040
There's one over here.

426
0:30:46.040 --> 0:30:47.040
Over here.

427
0:30:47.040 --> 0:30:48.040
Sorry.

428
0:30:48.040 --> 0:30:49.040
Next aisle.

429
0:30:49.040 --> 0:31:00.760
Thanks for the presentation.

430
0:31:00.760 --> 0:31:05.080
I'm curious whether do you have any data on how much of the research that we have in the

431
0:31:05.080 --> 0:31:09.960
software industry that goes to open source software versus closed source software, proprietary

432
0:31:09.960 --> 0:31:10.960
software?

433
0:31:10.960 --> 0:31:12.280
Do you have any data on that?

434
0:31:12.280 --> 0:31:15.840
No, we have not done any research of that nature, I'm afraid.

435
0:31:15.840 --> 0:31:17.760
It's an excellent question.

436
0:31:17.760 --> 0:31:20.360
There are so many questions to answer.

437
0:31:20.360 --> 0:31:22.200
That's an excellent question.

438
0:31:22.200 --> 0:31:28.120
Another question that we get a lot and still have not found a good way to answer is what

439
0:31:28.120 --> 0:31:33.400
is the consumption of open source or the usage.

440
0:31:33.400 --> 0:31:37.640
We know there are a lot of downloads but we don't necessarily have a good way of measuring

441
0:31:37.640 --> 0:31:38.640
usage.

442
0:31:38.640 --> 0:31:39.640
Very challenging to track.

443
0:31:39.640 --> 0:31:41.560
It's a challenging space to research.

444
0:31:41.560 --> 0:31:53.640
But good question.

445
0:31:53.640 --> 0:31:54.880
Thank you.

446
0:31:54.880 --> 0:31:59.400
You had a slide on diversity, a quote.

447
0:31:59.400 --> 0:32:04.640
My personal observation on developers is that there's not so many women amongst them.

448
0:32:04.640 --> 0:32:08.960
Is it also a topic of the Linux foundation to look into that?

449
0:32:08.960 --> 0:32:15.160
Or has some research been done to find the reason why that is and how to overcome them

450
0:32:15.160 --> 0:32:16.160
at some point?

451
0:32:16.160 --> 0:32:17.160
Yeah.

452
0:32:17.160 --> 0:32:22.120
So why are there so few women in open source is part of I'm going to go back to that slide

453
0:32:22.120 --> 0:32:27.360
so that you can see you can download the report.

454
0:32:27.360 --> 0:32:28.360
Actually here it is.

455
0:32:28.360 --> 0:32:35.640
So in this report we do offer some insight as to how we can help overcome the fact that

456
0:32:35.640 --> 0:32:43.360
we have diversity challenges and why we struggle to recruit women.

457
0:32:43.360 --> 0:32:50.040
I've come to learn through my exploration of COBOL as a programming language a little

458
0:32:50.040 --> 0:32:59.560
bit of the history about programming languages and computer science becoming more high value

459
0:32:59.560 --> 0:33:06.480
work and engineering becoming more high value work and society.

460
0:33:06.480 --> 0:33:13.760
It actually migrated from women programmers to men in the 60s.

461
0:33:13.760 --> 0:33:19.120
The first programmers, the film Hidden Figures, Women Using FORTRAN.

462
0:33:19.120 --> 0:33:22.600
It was not necessarily a high skilled activity.

463
0:33:22.600 --> 0:33:26.500
In fact COBOL is an incredibly teachable skill.

464
0:33:26.500 --> 0:33:32.320
And there's an amazing opportunity to skill up anybody who wants to learn how to code.

465
0:33:32.320 --> 0:33:34.000
They generally can.

466
0:33:34.000 --> 0:33:42.480
But over time computer engineering became deemed to be high value work and became the

467
0:33:42.480 --> 0:33:45.240
work of men exclusively.

468
0:33:45.240 --> 0:33:49.760
And the technology industry broadly, this is a function of tech in general, the math,

469
0:33:49.760 --> 0:33:52.260
the sciences, the humanities.

470
0:33:52.260 --> 0:33:59.760
I don't think that we've done our daughters a great service in socializing them into the

471
0:33:59.760 --> 0:34:00.760
sciences.

472
0:34:00.760 --> 0:34:02.920
I was not socialized into tech.

473
0:34:02.920 --> 0:34:12.880
But I see that LEGO, one of the best toys I ever played with as a child, has been marketed

474
0:34:12.880 --> 0:34:15.640
not as a gender neutral toy anymore.

475
0:34:15.640 --> 0:34:21.840
There's LEGO friends in the pink boxes and there's the helicopters and the other stuff.

476
0:34:21.840 --> 0:34:23.400
And that's marketed in the boys section.

477
0:34:23.400 --> 0:34:25.660
And I think that's unfortunate.

478
0:34:25.660 --> 0:34:30.160
Because the type of LEGO products that are marketed for girls are around, it's a house

479
0:34:30.160 --> 0:34:34.320
or it's a bakery or it's a beauty shop.

480
0:34:34.320 --> 0:34:38.640
So if I play with LEGO, I'm playing with the beauty shop and the shopping mall.

481
0:34:38.640 --> 0:34:45.760
But if I buy the other color of LEGO, I'm building the Death Star, the Star Wars station

482
0:34:45.760 --> 0:34:47.760
or the helicopter.

483
0:34:47.760 --> 0:34:48.760
That's really a problem.

484
0:34:48.760 --> 0:34:54.520
So I think we have generational change to make the way we socialize girls and the way

485
0:34:54.520 --> 0:34:58.280
we socialize boys to do nontraditional activities as well.

486
0:34:58.280 --> 0:35:02.240
And we're in a real non-binary kind of world.

487
0:35:02.240 --> 0:35:10.360
And we have to think about how we socialize for the next generation.

488
0:35:10.360 --> 0:35:13.360
More questions?

489
0:35:13.360 --> 0:35:17.800
No questions.

490
0:35:17.800 --> 0:35:22.920
It's drink time.

491
0:35:22.920 --> 0:35:23.920
Thank you everybody.

492
0:35:23.920 --> 0:35:25.960
Is that, were there any more questions?

493
0:35:25.960 --> 0:35:26.960
Didn't think so.

494
0:35:26.960 --> 0:35:28.080
I see no hands.

495
0:35:28.080 --> 0:35:29.080
This is awesome.

496
0:35:29.080 --> 0:35:31.920
Thank you so much for coming at the very end of the day.

497
0:35:31.920 --> 0:35:32.920
You were great.

498
0:35:32.920 --> 0:35:33.920
Thank you.

499
0:35:33.920 --> 0:35:34.920
Thank you.

500
0:35:34.920 --> 0:35:35.920
Thank you.

501
0:35:35.920 --> 0:36:01.920
Thank you.
