0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.840
Hi, everyone. The next speaker is here. So our next talk is podcasting 2.0. It's all

2
0:00:11.840 --> 0:00:21.560
about interoperability. And the next speaker is Benjamin Bellamy. Give him a round of applause.

3
0:00:21.560 --> 0:00:30.400
Hello, everyone. Thank you for being here. Today we're going to talk about podcasting

4
0:00:30.400 --> 0:00:38.920
and more specifically podcasting 2.0. And more specifically about this. Can you all

5
0:00:38.920 --> 0:00:49.280
see the screen? Yeah? Good. So you can read it because I cannot pronounce that word. Interperability.

6
0:00:49.280 --> 0:00:59.440
Love the concept. Hate the word. So why talking about podcasting here at FOSS-DEM? Because

7
0:00:59.440 --> 0:01:07.120
podcasting will save the open Internet. So let me introduce myself. I'm Benjamin Bellamy.

8
0:01:07.120 --> 0:01:13.040
I love podcasts, which is why I'm going to talk about podcasting. I love open source,

9
0:01:13.040 --> 0:01:23.560
which is why I'm here today. I'm founder and CEO of a company called Adores, which is Latin.

10
0:01:23.560 --> 0:01:30.080
So don't ask me how to pronounce it. It's Latin. No one knows. And it means going to

11
0:01:30.080 --> 0:01:40.280
the ears. And I'm the father of Castopod. We'll talk about that later. And by father,

12
0:01:40.280 --> 0:01:46.760
I mean, Castopod is my baby. I was here when it was conceived. But now it's all grown up

13
0:01:46.760 --> 0:01:54.040
and I cannot see it as much as I would like to. But enough talking about me, let's talk

14
0:01:54.040 --> 0:02:03.680
about you. So I'm going to make a quick poll. I'm going to ask each one of you four questions.

15
0:02:03.680 --> 0:02:09.640
So that's going to take half an hour. And there will be a half time for Q&A. Or no.

16
0:02:09.640 --> 0:02:20.400
Let's raise your hand. Who here is a podcaster? Also, like 30%. Who's a developer? Okay. Just

17
0:02:20.400 --> 0:02:33.240
one arm because that's 200%. Have you heard of podcasting 2.0 before? Okay. So 25%. And

18
0:02:33.240 --> 0:02:50.800
have you heard of Castopod? 20%. Okay. So let's talk about users. Users are always the

19
0:02:50.800 --> 0:02:59.840
problem. No users, no bug reports. So the problem that we are facing now, all of us,

20
0:02:59.840 --> 0:03:08.360
is that we have to choose. We have to choose between the open web and the closed web. Between

21
0:03:08.360 --> 0:03:18.600
where we have control and where we don't have control. But of course, we don't have to be

22
0:03:18.600 --> 0:03:27.600
religious about this. And we know that closed silos are comfortable. When we are on a website

23
0:03:27.600 --> 0:03:34.760
of watching videos, silos are very useful because you get everything you need. You need

24
0:03:34.760 --> 0:03:41.680
a feature. It's there. You need to upload a file. You need to index it. You need to

25
0:03:41.680 --> 0:03:49.280
recommend it. You need to monetize it. Anything as a user or as a content creator. It's all

26
0:03:49.280 --> 0:04:00.080
there. Very easy. Very convenient. So at the end, yeah, that's probably the best solution.

27
0:04:00.080 --> 0:04:10.280
Let's all use closed silos because they're so much easier for everything. So, yeah, actually,

28
0:04:10.280 --> 0:04:21.120
I was wrong. So let's go to closed silos and forget about this open Internet problem. Or

29
0:04:21.120 --> 0:04:27.000
maybe there's something else. If you're a user, yes, maybe that can make sense. But

30
0:04:27.000 --> 0:04:32.760
as soon as you are a content creator, and I see that many of you are podcasters, we

31
0:04:32.760 --> 0:04:40.120
have to think about what can influence the content that you create. If you are on the

32
0:04:40.120 --> 0:04:48.920
open Internet, so that's a federated network or a self-hosted platform, whichever, well,

33
0:04:48.920 --> 0:04:59.520
you have to follow the regulations. The law applies to each and every one of you. If you

34
0:04:59.520 --> 0:05:09.200
don't, you'll probably get into some troubles. And that's it. You are the only one in control

35
0:05:09.200 --> 0:05:20.000
of your content. Whereas if you're on the closed web, so let's say YouTube, well, you

36
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:27.960
still have to follow the laws and the regulations. And you'll have issues as well on this platform.

37
0:05:27.960 --> 0:05:35.200
But at the same time, you have to follow the terms and conditions of the platform. The

38
0:05:35.200 --> 0:05:41.940
economic, political, ideological interests specific to the platform. And government pressure

39
0:05:41.940 --> 0:05:52.080
on the platform, talk about China or wherever, mass reporting of your content by opponent

40
0:05:52.080 --> 0:06:01.840
or competitors. This happens all the time, every day. A boat, how many times have we

41
0:06:01.840 --> 0:06:10.400
uploaded a content and we got a strike, and then you end up talking to a boat and say,

42
0:06:10.400 --> 0:06:18.520
I got a strike, I don't know, it makes no sense. Well, that's what happens. A moderator

43
0:06:18.520 --> 0:06:26.720
in a bad mood. And a platform shutting down. Like you create content, you put all your

44
0:06:26.720 --> 0:06:34.760
value into it. You trust a platform where you put the value that you created and then

45
0:06:34.760 --> 0:06:45.120
it's gone. I don't know, like Google+, goodbye. Goodbye, Google Wave. Goodbye, Google everything.

46
0:06:45.120 --> 0:06:57.320
So, now let's talk about audio blogging. How does everything that I just said applies to

47
0:06:57.320 --> 0:07:05.960
audio blogging? So obviously blogging, audio content. Audio blogging, yeah, that makes

48
0:07:05.960 --> 0:07:14.360
sense. But how to call it. So we don't talk about audio blogging anymore. We haven't for

49
0:07:14.360 --> 0:07:19.560
many years, 15 actually, because now we're talking about podcasting. Podcasting is a

50
0:07:19.560 --> 0:07:26.080
word that was invented by a journalist, Ben Hermesle, in the Guardian in 2004. And we've

51
0:07:26.080 --> 0:07:36.320
been talking about podcasting ever since. So, who created podcasting? Who are the founders

52
0:07:36.320 --> 0:07:46.120
of podcasting? Well, that may sound stupid, but there isn't any podcasting without podcasts.

53
0:07:46.120 --> 0:07:51.800
Podcasting is about podcasts. It's about content. You can have the best technology ever. If

54
0:07:51.800 --> 0:07:58.940
you don't have any content, at the end of the day it's going to be useless. So, these

55
0:07:58.940 --> 0:08:10.320
are some of the oldest and most famous podcasts. These are my choice. If you ask someone else,

56
0:08:10.320 --> 0:08:15.560
you'll probably get others. So the first one is the Illusion of Independent Radio from

57
0:08:15.560 --> 0:08:24.240
1989. Of course, at that time it wasn't on Twitch, it wasn't on Apple Podcasts. It was

58
0:08:24.240 --> 0:08:35.560
broadcasted manually on cassette tapes and copied from tape to tape, but still it's considered

59
0:08:35.560 --> 0:08:42.800
by many as the first podcast ever. And as you can see, the original title, it was from

60
0:08:42.800 --> 0:08:53.720
Russia. Then in 2004, the Daily Source Code was a podcast that was broadcasted every day

61
0:08:53.720 --> 0:09:01.600
by Adam Curry, a kind of technical podcast. Then the Year After the Podcasting, Do It

62
0:09:01.600 --> 0:09:11.920
Yourself Guide by Todd Cochrane. 2006, the Lens and the Sun podcast experiment by obviously

63
0:09:11.920 --> 0:09:20.240
Lens and the Sun. There are many others. I won't spend more time naming all of them.

64
0:09:20.240 --> 0:09:31.480
But 2014, Serial by Sarah Koenig. This one is important because it's the 350 million

65
0:09:31.480 --> 0:09:39.160
download podcasts. So that made a difference because we went from a model where, yeah,

66
0:09:39.160 --> 0:09:44.560
you have some nerds talking to other nerds and there were like a bunch of them here,

67
0:09:44.560 --> 0:09:57.760
a bunch of them there. But now we're talking big numbers. So that's for the content. Now

68
0:09:57.760 --> 0:10:06.360
the architects, who designed it? Who is at the origin of podcasting the technology? So

69
0:10:06.360 --> 0:10:19.080
pop quiz. There is no technology here. Just the names and the dates. So 1993, Fronhofer

70
0:10:19.080 --> 0:10:31.720
Gesellschaft. Who knows what invention is behind that? MP3, yeah, correct. MP3. 1995,

71
0:10:31.720 --> 0:10:48.440
anyone knows? RSS, yes, correct. 2000, yeah, enclosures. Enclosures in RSS. 2003, yeah,

72
0:10:48.440 --> 0:10:58.880
that's a big... Yeah, just before the Daily Source Code, actually the Daily Source Code

73
0:10:58.880 --> 0:11:06.680
was a way to apply this. It's pushing your podcast to your iPod. And at the same time

74
0:11:06.680 --> 0:11:18.760
we got iPodder.org, which was a repository and index for podcasts. And 2005, speak louder.

75
0:11:18.760 --> 0:11:32.120
No, not the iPod. The iPod was earlier. This is podcasting iTunes. Okay, so that's the

76
0:11:32.120 --> 0:11:41.160
technology. But what's a podcast? Well, there are several definitions for a podcast. There

77
0:11:41.160 --> 0:11:50.600
is no official definition for a podcast. Some people say it's a content that you can download

78
0:11:50.600 --> 0:12:01.560
and listen to whenever you want to, wherever you want to. Some say it's an audio content.

79
0:12:01.560 --> 0:12:07.160
And my definition, the one I like the best, and I think it's probably, it should be the

80
0:12:07.160 --> 0:12:16.800
only one, if you ask me, it's Adam's Courage One. A podcast is an RSS feed with an enclosure.

81
0:12:16.800 --> 0:12:27.980
So an RSS feed and an enclosure. That's a podcast. So example, this is not a podcast.

82
0:12:27.980 --> 0:12:34.600
This is a podcast. I don't know if you could see the difference. I'm going to show you

83
0:12:34.600 --> 0:12:46.880
it to you again. So not a podcast. A podcast. So for the one who did not upload, this is

84
0:12:46.880 --> 0:12:51.440
not a podcast because there is no RSS feed. You can listen to it. You can download it.

85
0:12:51.440 --> 0:12:58.200
You can listen to it wherever you want to. But you cannot get an RSS feed. So you cannot

86
0:12:58.200 --> 0:13:06.240
select and choose the application on which you want to listen to it. And you are in a

87
0:13:06.240 --> 0:13:12.640
closed ecosystem here. This is Spotify. Obviously you all recognize. So this is not the open

88
0:13:12.640 --> 0:13:20.160
internet. So this is why I do not consider this as a podcast. Whereas this is a podcast.

89
0:13:20.160 --> 0:13:40.760
And you can tell it's better looking. So if you remember the architects, in 2005, Apple

90
0:13:40.760 --> 0:13:48.080
Podcasts, which was iTunes podcast at that time, was launched. And it was launched by

91
0:13:48.080 --> 0:13:55.600
Apple, by Steve Jobs, right after Adam Curry, who was at the beginning, he was involved

92
0:13:55.600 --> 0:14:08.080
technically and also he was still a podcaster. He gave to Steve Jobs himself the index that

93
0:14:08.080 --> 0:14:14.240
he and some other guys developed at that time, which was called iPodder.org, which was an

94
0:14:14.240 --> 0:14:22.760
index with 4,000 podcasts. Remember that number, 4,000 podcasts. This is the index that we

95
0:14:22.760 --> 0:14:30.200
had at that time. And it was all the podcasts that we could listen to and at least search

96
0:14:30.200 --> 0:14:39.880
for within the iPodder index. And this is a changeover because at that specific time,

97
0:14:39.880 --> 0:14:46.280
Apple took care of podcasting. They did a pretty decent job because they got no money

98
0:14:46.280 --> 0:14:54.400
from it, just marketing image, but they did pretty much everything in the podcast industry

99
0:14:54.400 --> 0:15:07.240
since that moment. So let's recap. Here you can see 1993 MP3, RSS, RSS plus MP3, RSS plus

100
0:15:07.240 --> 0:15:20.280
MP3 to the iPods, iTunes, and nothing. Nothing. So that's not a bug. That's not PowerPoint

101
0:15:20.280 --> 0:15:26.920
breaking my slide because this is impressive. This is not PowerPoint. And nothing happened.

102
0:15:26.920 --> 0:15:36.560
So this is what I call the status quo of podcasting. Meaning for 10 to 15 years, nothing happened

103
0:15:36.560 --> 0:15:45.440
and it stayed the same. You can see here, so we still have hosting and indexes and apps

104
0:15:45.440 --> 0:15:58.200
and lines going from all the way crossing, which means that podcasting is still decentralized.

105
0:15:58.200 --> 0:16:07.760
And that's a very important point because over the years, let me go back a little bit.

106
0:16:07.760 --> 0:16:16.100
Here you see that too much. We had YouTube, Facebook, and many new technologies that disrupted

107
0:16:16.100 --> 0:16:22.680
the markets, but they're not centralized. When you're on Facebook, you're not on the

108
0:16:22.680 --> 0:16:28.720
internet. You're in Facebook. When you are on YouTube, you're not on the internet. You're

109
0:16:28.720 --> 0:16:41.560
in Facebook, in YouTube. Whereas podcasting, well, it's decentralized and it's still decentralized.

110
0:16:41.560 --> 0:16:49.400
So that's good news. But at the same time, not a single feature has been added for 15

111
0:16:49.400 --> 0:17:01.720
years. I try to think about this. In which industry we saw no innovation for 15 years

112
0:17:01.720 --> 0:17:11.640
and we're talking about the internet. Not a single feature for 15 years. Nothing happened.

113
0:17:11.640 --> 0:17:24.920
And at the same time, we saw the core of it, RSS, we saw it dying many times, mostly killed

114
0:17:24.920 --> 0:17:33.640
by Google many times. So at the end of the day, yeah, what's happening to podcasting?

115
0:17:33.640 --> 0:17:42.960
Is it dead? It's still alive. But between these 10 years, so there's 10 years, I know

116
0:17:42.960 --> 0:17:50.640
the word I cannot pronounce. There was no development because of a chicken and egg problem.

117
0:17:50.640 --> 0:18:00.200
If you're a podcast hosting company or developing a hosting solution, if you want to add a new

118
0:18:00.200 --> 0:18:06.480
feature, well, you need an application to implement it. Otherwise, it's useless. No

119
0:18:06.480 --> 0:18:15.360
one will say it. So you won't do it. And if you are developing a podcast listening app,

120
0:18:15.360 --> 0:18:21.400
well, it's useless to implement a new feature because if there is no hosting company implementing

121
0:18:21.400 --> 0:18:29.560
it, it's really useless. So everyone is waiting. So a solution would be to ask the one in the

122
0:18:29.560 --> 0:18:38.600
middle who's carrying who's taking care of the index, Apple, to make the first step,

123
0:18:38.600 --> 0:18:48.680
well, try to ask something to Apple and see how it goes. So, yeah, nothing happened for

124
0:18:48.680 --> 0:19:03.080
all these years. And then 2020, Adam Curry and Dave Jones decided to reboot it to make

125
0:19:03.080 --> 0:19:11.800
a podcasting 2.0. So podcasting 2.0 is an open specification. And by open, I mean it's

126
0:19:11.800 --> 0:19:20.520
open source. And it's open to anyone. So each one of you can come and play with us and say,

127
0:19:20.520 --> 0:19:28.160
I need this. I want this. Podcasting is missing. This important feature or this feature that

128
0:19:28.160 --> 0:19:35.760
is not important to anyone but me doesn't matter. It's an open specification open to

129
0:19:35.760 --> 0:19:44.880
everyone. Really, I mean it. And technically, it's a namespace that extends the podcasting

130
0:19:44.880 --> 0:19:51.720
DTD, the one that was created by Apple and that everyone has been following for years.

131
0:19:51.720 --> 0:19:57.040
Even Google is following the Apple DTD now. They dropped their they had one, but they

132
0:19:57.040 --> 0:20:04.640
eventually dropped it. So if you go there, you will see all the new features, which are

133
0:20:04.640 --> 0:20:20.760
usually new tags that had been added to podcast. So podcasting 2.0 is about decentralizing

134
0:20:20.760 --> 0:20:29.480
and returning to open source. So you everyone can be a part of it and everyone can play

135
0:20:29.480 --> 0:20:40.280
together. That's really important. But this is not how we are going to convince users

136
0:20:40.280 --> 0:20:48.680
and listeners that this is the right solution. It's almost impossible to tell people you

137
0:20:48.680 --> 0:20:54.240
shouldn't be on Facebook because it's not open source. And you don't know what they're

138
0:20:54.240 --> 0:20:59.340
doing with your data. You have to be on something that's open and decentralized and federated.

139
0:20:59.340 --> 0:21:04.240
People just don't care. It's useless. If you do that, you're going to be exhausted before

140
0:21:04.240 --> 0:21:11.280
you have convinced two people. The only way to convince people is to be better than closed

141
0:21:11.280 --> 0:21:17.400
solutions and closed ecosystem. So you have to focus on user experience and features.

142
0:21:17.400 --> 0:21:25.520
And this is what podcasting 2.0 is about. So there are many, many, many new features

143
0:21:25.520 --> 0:21:37.480
that are in podcasting 2.0. These are only the ones that have been implemented yet. So

144
0:21:37.480 --> 0:21:46.400
alternate enclosures. Yes. Because now we are using MP3, but MP3 is 30 years old. Maybe

145
0:21:46.400 --> 0:21:59.080
we like better M4A or OGG or FLAG or Dolby Atmos or low bandwidth encoding files. Well,

146
0:21:59.080 --> 0:22:05.120
how do you do that with the usual DTD? You cannot. With podcasting 2.0, you can't do

147
0:22:05.120 --> 0:22:11.320
that. You can have multiple enclosures for one episode. Boostograms. Boostograms. Who

148
0:22:11.320 --> 0:22:23.880
knows what is Boostogram? Okay. Like 5%. Boostogram is a way to send message, money, and love

149
0:22:23.880 --> 0:22:32.120
to a podcaster. So you're listening to a podcast and suddenly something, you find it's really

150
0:22:32.120 --> 0:22:38.600
interesting to you. Oh, I love that. You click, you send money. So it's a Bitcoin over the

151
0:22:38.600 --> 0:22:46.680
LND network. You send a message and you send a timestamp. So the podcaster knows at what

152
0:22:46.680 --> 0:22:53.600
time within the episode this boostogram was sent and you receive money and message and

153
0:22:53.600 --> 0:23:03.920
love. Chapters. If you want to have chapters, of course you can have chapters within an

154
0:23:03.920 --> 0:23:12.720
MP3 file. But if you have alternate enclosures and if you want to modify the chapters afterwards

155
0:23:12.720 --> 0:23:18.120
and if you want the chapters to be indexed, to be seen without having to download the

156
0:23:18.120 --> 0:23:28.480
whole files, well, having chapters in a JSON file can be pretty much useful.

157
0:23:28.480 --> 0:23:37.480
Pots and season. Well, what if you want to give a title to a season and not just a number

158
0:23:37.480 --> 0:23:48.200
and to make it more easy to see an index? Funding. If you have Patreon or PayPal, you

159
0:23:48.200 --> 0:23:54.320
can put that within the RSS feed so that it shows up directly within the podcast app,

160
0:23:54.320 --> 0:24:07.480
the podcast player. UID. I cannot understand why we didn't have that earlier. If you have

161
0:24:07.480 --> 0:24:13.280
a podcast, very often you move it from a domain name to another, from a hosting company to

162
0:24:13.280 --> 0:24:20.440
another. How can you tell that these two RSS feeds are actually the same podcasts? Well,

163
0:24:20.440 --> 0:24:28.360
for podcasting 2.0, you can't. Now you have an ID that doesn't change. Live, because podcasting

164
0:24:28.360 --> 0:24:38.640
is very often about live events. You're talking live, you're talking to everyone, and also

165
0:24:38.640 --> 0:24:45.400
making a podcast and the live will be the podcast, but you want the users to be able

166
0:24:45.400 --> 0:24:50.720
to get a notification within the podcast app that says, oh, your favorite podcast is now

167
0:24:50.720 --> 0:24:59.760
live. Click here and listen to it. Location. Because you want your content to be easily

168
0:24:59.760 --> 0:25:07.120
found and sometimes it's about a specific place. So how about geolocation? I think there's

169
0:25:07.120 --> 0:25:15.920
something called Google map, but obviously nothing related to podcasting. But with podcasting

170
0:25:15.920 --> 0:25:23.360
2.0, if your podcast is about tourism, well, you can pinpoint an episode or a podcast.

171
0:25:23.360 --> 0:25:32.520
So then you can put it on a map. You can put your podcast on a map. Locked. We've seen

172
0:25:32.520 --> 0:25:42.080
podcasts that were copied and monetized specifically on the anchor platform. Some people found

173
0:25:42.080 --> 0:25:48.800
out that their podcast had been copied and copied on anchor and then monetized. They

174
0:25:48.800 --> 0:25:54.480
didn't know about it. So here it won't prevent the copy, but at least it will say, please

175
0:25:54.480 --> 0:26:00.120
do not copy that podcast so that the hosting company knows that this podcast shouldn't

176
0:26:00.120 --> 0:26:08.000
be copied. Medium, because podcasting is not just only about talking. It can be music.

177
0:26:08.000 --> 0:26:16.160
It can be many, many other media. OP3 is an open source, open data, analytic platform

178
0:26:16.160 --> 0:26:26.920
that allows you to share your analytics with third party. Person is about saying this content

179
0:26:26.920 --> 0:26:36.640
was made by this host with this guest and this sound engineer. But ping is a way to

180
0:26:36.640 --> 0:26:44.600
say, hey, my RSS feed just got updated. And you send that information into the hive blockchain

181
0:26:44.600 --> 0:26:53.800
so that you don't have to query an RSS feed every minute to know when it was updated.

182
0:26:53.800 --> 0:27:02.400
Imagine how many requests Apple has to do to get notified where all the podcasts are

183
0:27:02.400 --> 0:27:11.320
updated. And actually they are not notified. They fetch the answer. Sat streaming, almost

184
0:27:11.320 --> 0:27:19.600
the same as a boostogram, but it's while you are listening to a content, like every second.

185
0:27:19.600 --> 0:27:30.320
People interact is about talking with your audience from any app. So you say to the podcast

186
0:27:30.320 --> 0:27:37.800
app, this is where the discussion is taking place. This is where you should interact with

187
0:27:37.800 --> 0:27:46.360
the podcaster. And it can be, of course, on the podcaster platform. It could be on the

188
0:27:46.360 --> 0:27:53.320
Fediverse. It doesn't have to be on a closed platform where you are not, you don't have

189
0:27:53.320 --> 0:28:01.200
control on your content and on the content that your audience creates. Sound bytes is

190
0:28:01.200 --> 0:28:15.160
a way to make small byte of sound, obviously. Transcript, which does not exist on podcasting,

191
0:28:15.160 --> 0:28:21.760
except for podcasting 2.0, which is a real shame because accessibility is mandatory in

192
0:28:21.760 --> 0:28:31.160
Europe. It is mandatory in the US. And still all the big platforms seem not to care about

193
0:28:31.160 --> 0:28:40.680
this. Well, podcasting 2.0 brings a way to add transcriptions to the podcast. And a transcription

194
0:28:40.680 --> 0:28:47.040
that the podcaster is responsible for. So as a podcaster, you can correct or do whatever

195
0:28:47.040 --> 0:28:52.520
you want to in the transcript. And the transcript can be in the original language or it can

196
0:28:52.520 --> 0:28:59.480
be a translation. So you can make your podcast available to people who are hard of hearing

197
0:28:59.480 --> 0:29:11.080
or people who just don't speak your language very well. And TXT, which is like the same

198
0:29:11.080 --> 0:29:18.920
DNS TXT record works. Right now, if you want to go on a podcast platform as a podcaster

199
0:29:18.920 --> 0:29:24.520
and you want to prove your ownership, the only way, the Apple way, is to put your email

200
0:29:24.520 --> 0:29:32.000
address within the RSS feed. And this will allow you to get a lot of spam. Well, with

201
0:29:32.000 --> 0:29:37.120
this, the platform who wants to verify your ownership will say, please put that token

202
0:29:37.120 --> 0:29:42.120
into your RSS feed. You put it and then you're good, you're gone. And you don't have to share

203
0:29:42.120 --> 0:29:54.080
your email address. So all these features, this is not a wish list. This exists. This

204
0:29:54.080 --> 0:30:00.960
works. This has been implemented. And it's working now. It's working now in many application

205
0:30:00.960 --> 0:30:11.360
platforms and services. And of course, if your podcast is a podcasting 2.0 podcast,

206
0:30:11.360 --> 0:30:20.760
it will also work on all the non-podcasting 2.0 platforms. It is backward compatible.

207
0:30:20.760 --> 0:30:32.880
So where are we now? There are over 400,000 podcasts that have declared the podcasting

208
0:30:32.880 --> 0:30:47.040
2.0 namespace in their feed. And as I said, interoperability is the key. Meaning this

209
0:30:47.040 --> 0:30:54.840
works only because we are working together. It's not a closed silo. And this is why it

210
0:30:54.840 --> 0:31:04.320
works. Here, there are only a few of the platforms that are implementing it. So on the left,

211
0:31:04.320 --> 0:31:10.880
you see the hosting services. On the right, the players. And in the middle, the indexes.

212
0:31:10.880 --> 0:31:27.680
There are many others. And they are all working together. So that's pretty nice. But let's

213
0:31:27.680 --> 0:31:36.520
not forget that the battle is not over. The GAFM, or we talk about saga for podcasting,

214
0:31:36.520 --> 0:31:52.680
Spotify, Apple, Google, and Amazon, they won't quit that easily. Last example, Spotify decided

215
0:31:52.680 --> 0:32:00.920
to implement chapters, but they didn't use that. They used their own way. So we need

216
0:32:00.920 --> 0:32:11.040
to say the word and to use it. But that won't be enough. Podcasting 2.0 has a portfolio

217
0:32:11.040 --> 0:32:24.080
eye, which is podcast index. Podcast index is a podcast index. Pretty convenient. That

218
0:32:24.080 --> 0:32:35.960
has all the podcasts. And it's open source, open data. Meaning that anyone can have access

219
0:32:35.960 --> 0:32:47.880
to the index. Imagine before the year 2020, as a podcaster, if you want to exist, you

220
0:32:47.880 --> 0:32:55.720
need to ask for Apple to grant you permission to add your podcasts in their index. You don't

221
0:32:55.720 --> 0:33:03.240
have right access. You need to ask permission. And if you say bad words, you're not sure

222
0:33:03.240 --> 0:33:13.040
that they'll accept you. And as a podcast app, if you want your users to be able to

223
0:33:13.040 --> 0:33:20.520
find podcasts, so to look for them, as the podcast app, you need to ask Apple to grant

224
0:33:20.520 --> 0:33:27.320
you permission to read the index so that your users can send some queries that will end

225
0:33:27.320 --> 0:33:32.720
up in Apple podcast index. So that you can say, yeah, you're looking for podcasts talking

226
0:33:32.720 --> 0:33:45.360
about whatever. This is what we found. So if Apple doesn't want you to continue working

227
0:33:45.360 --> 0:33:51.840
with them from one minute to the next one, they can ban you, they can revoke the access,

228
0:33:51.840 --> 0:33:59.600
and your app becomes useless to all your users. So with the podcast index, you can get an

229
0:33:59.600 --> 0:34:07.080
API key. You can get access. You can query as much as you want to. And if you're not

230
0:34:07.080 --> 0:34:13.360
comfortable with that, because there's still a centralized database and a centralized API

231
0:34:13.360 --> 0:34:19.440
server, you can download the database. The podcast index is a database. You can download

232
0:34:19.440 --> 0:34:26.280
it. You go to podcastindex.org. You click download, and you download the whole database,

233
0:34:26.280 --> 0:34:39.080
all of them. So everything is on the podcast index, except stuff that is illegal, obviously.

234
0:34:39.080 --> 0:34:47.040
But there's no preference. They're not making choices for what should be allowed and what

235
0:34:47.040 --> 0:34:56.120
should not be allowed. And right now, it is twice as big as the Apple podcast index. So

236
0:34:56.120 --> 0:35:09.640
that's 4 million podcasts. So remember, in 2005, we had 4,000. Now, 4 million. So if

237
0:35:09.640 --> 0:35:24.760
we recap again, the void is not blank anymore. We have podcasting 2.0. And we can work on

238
0:35:24.760 --> 0:35:38.160
this. So let's see how this works. We'll see how it works on Castopod. So what is Castopod?

239
0:35:38.160 --> 0:35:47.960
It's a podcast hosting solution. It's open source. It's AGPL3. It relies on PHP, MySQL,

240
0:35:47.960 --> 0:36:00.160
the dignity 4. And of course, it is podcasting 2.0 compatible. It implements chapters, funding,

241
0:36:00.160 --> 0:36:11.520
UID location, locked, OP3, social interact. And for that, it uses the activity pump protocol,

242
0:36:11.520 --> 0:36:19.720
meaning it's connected to the Fediverse and to Mastodon, obviously. So where you're on

243
0:36:19.720 --> 0:36:27.080
Castopod, you publish an episode. It's going to show up on your Mastodon feed as a user.

244
0:36:27.080 --> 0:36:37.120
And you'll be able to like it, share it, comment it. And the stars, the comments will come

245
0:36:37.120 --> 0:36:44.560
back on your Castopod server. So when you interact with your audience, the reactions

246
0:36:44.560 --> 0:36:53.680
from your audience are on your server. There is no middleman between you as a content creator

247
0:36:53.680 --> 0:37:02.160
and your audience. No technical person involved. No legal entity involved. So no one can pull

248
0:37:02.160 --> 0:37:13.760
the plug and no one can send you their lawyer. And why are we developing that? Because we

249
0:37:13.760 --> 0:37:24.880
love you and we think you deserve it. You deserve free speech. All of you. And your

250
0:37:24.880 --> 0:37:36.600
love that you send back to us pays our rent. Or it doesn't. So in order to be sustainable,

251
0:37:36.600 --> 0:37:48.640
Castopod has been funded by Adorice, my company. By NLNet, the NLNet foundation. Thank you,

252
0:37:48.640 --> 0:37:56.120
thank you. We are on Open Collective. So if you want to be a part of it, because we value

253
0:37:56.120 --> 0:38:04.640
everything that you can bring, time, talent, treasure, anything, go to Open Collective.

254
0:38:04.640 --> 0:38:12.880
We got a lot of value from you. For instance, we translated Castopod in French. Because

255
0:38:12.880 --> 0:38:21.280
as some of you may have noticed, I have a slightly French accent. And Castopod has been

256
0:38:21.280 --> 0:38:32.560
translated in 20 languages. Not 100%, but almost the public port. Chinese, Spanish,

257
0:38:32.560 --> 0:38:42.960
Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, many of them. And we provide paid hosting on Castopod.com.

258
0:38:42.960 --> 0:38:47.200
So if you want to host your podcast on Castopod, but you don't want to take care of this, you

259
0:38:47.200 --> 0:38:57.880
don't want to go through the trouble of self-hosting, you can talk to me. Or go to Castopod.com.

260
0:38:57.880 --> 0:39:04.880
So if you want to know more about Castopod, just go to Castopod.org and you'll find everything

261
0:39:04.880 --> 0:39:14.280
that you need to know there. If you want to install it, go to docs.Castopod.org and you

262
0:39:14.280 --> 0:39:26.560
will find many ways to install it. It's PHP MySQL, so with a basic Apache, mod PHP, MySQL,

263
0:39:26.560 --> 0:39:33.680
and MariaDB, or Percona, whatever, you'll install it. We have Docker images. It works

264
0:39:33.680 --> 0:39:44.960
on Unohost. I saw some guys installing it on Synology, NAS. Very easy to install. So

265
0:39:44.960 --> 0:39:55.600
what does it look like? So here, this is the logging page. And it has nothing interesting.

266
0:39:55.600 --> 0:40:01.640
It's just a logging page, but it works. And if you forget your password, there's a logging

267
0:40:01.640 --> 0:40:10.480
link. On the dashboard, you'll get all the information that you need for your podcast,

268
0:40:10.480 --> 0:40:20.040
the storage, the bandwidth, how much you've been using. But the thing is, all the information

269
0:40:20.040 --> 0:40:27.280
and the analytics, they are yours. The number of listeners, they're yours. They're on your

270
0:40:27.280 --> 0:40:36.440
server. This is not Google Analytics. You have the raw data. Of course, it's GDPR compliant,

271
0:40:36.440 --> 0:40:42.280
but everything is yours. Now, if you want to create a podcast, it's going to take like

272
0:40:42.280 --> 0:40:47.800
30 seconds and you're up and running. If you want to create a new episode, it's going to

273
0:40:47.800 --> 0:40:54.840
take 30 seconds and you're up and running. Of course, I'm not counting the time that

274
0:40:54.840 --> 0:41:01.440
you need to record the podcast, but that's up to you. Then you'll be able to listen to

275
0:41:01.440 --> 0:41:09.560
the podcast, of course, on the website. Castopod has a pretty decent website. I haven't said

276
0:41:09.560 --> 0:41:16.960
that, but it's podcasting 1.0 compatible. So you will be able to listen to your podcast

277
0:41:16.960 --> 0:41:28.520
on any platform, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Deezer, Amazon, everywhere. If your

278
0:41:28.520 --> 0:41:37.640
content is geolocated, you'll be able to see it on the beautiful map, so open street map,

279
0:41:37.640 --> 0:41:50.520
and you can have private content, like premium content, if you want to make a paid subscription

280
0:41:50.520 --> 0:42:00.960
or maybe just for your friends. When you are connected to the Fediverse, people will be

281
0:42:00.960 --> 0:42:08.360
able to interact with your content and you will see the answers back on your Castopod

282
0:42:08.360 --> 0:42:15.720
server. Here, this comment is a Mastodon comment, I think. It comes back to your server. It's

283
0:42:15.720 --> 0:42:31.280
yours. Here, this is the OP3 website. This was developed by John Sporlock. This is an

284
0:42:31.280 --> 0:42:40.120
analytics website that allows you to have statistic analytics on a third-party platform,

285
0:42:40.120 --> 0:42:45.080
which is really convenient if you want to be able to share that with third parties.

286
0:42:45.080 --> 0:42:51.600
You have a third party involved, counting how many listeners you have, but it's open

287
0:42:51.600 --> 0:43:03.920
source and open data. Of course, everything said again, works everywhere. This is a podcast

288
0:43:03.920 --> 0:43:15.320
addict, so you can see the transcription. It's showing on your phone. Still podcast addict.

289
0:43:15.320 --> 0:43:26.200
Here you can see the person who was involved in the creation of the podcast. I think we're

290
0:43:26.200 --> 0:43:33.600
done as a conclusion. How can you help? How can you be a part of it? Well, very easy.

291
0:43:33.600 --> 0:43:46.600
Just go to newpodcastapps.com and make your choice. Find an app, find a service provider,

292
0:43:46.600 --> 0:43:54.000
hosting company, hosting whatever. It doesn't have to be Castopod. Of course, it's the best,

293
0:43:54.000 --> 0:44:03.240
but you don't have to believe me. You can make your own decision. Stop telling you as

294
0:44:03.240 --> 0:44:09.440
a podcaster. Stop telling your audience, go to Apple podcast and give me some stars. No,

295
0:44:09.440 --> 0:44:23.600
these are your stars, not Apple stars. If you want to know more about this subject,

296
0:44:23.600 --> 0:44:30.480
the pod farther 2.0, la saga de pi�onier continuu, which will be in the podcast magazine

297
0:44:30.480 --> 0:44:38.160
number 2. I think it's going to be out in 10 days or so. It's in French. If you don't

298
0:44:38.160 --> 0:44:46.160
understand French, it will also be on Castopod's blog. You have the URL here. There's an RSS

299
0:44:46.160 --> 0:44:53.840
feed because RSS is not for podcasting only. You can also read all the articles. The slides

300
0:44:53.840 --> 0:45:11.440
are on the first website. Since we are talking about podcasting, for the listening, there's

301
0:45:11.440 --> 0:45:19.640
a podcast which is conveniently called Podcasting 2.0, which talks about Podcasting 2.0. It's

302
0:45:19.640 --> 0:45:27.280
hosted by Adam Curry and Dave Jones. It's every Friday. You can listen to it live. If

303
0:45:27.280 --> 0:45:33.960
you're using a Podcasting 2.0 app, you'll get the notification. You'll click on it and

304
0:45:33.960 --> 0:45:41.760
you'll be able to listen to it live or after if you don't want to listen to it live. Podcast

305
0:45:41.760 --> 0:45:53.080
weekly review by Sam Thethe and James Cridland. They talk about Podcasting 2.0 a lot. James

306
0:45:53.080 --> 0:46:02.440
Cridland also has a daily podcast which is called PodNews. I highly recommend these three.

307
0:46:02.440 --> 0:46:14.000
Thank you. We have four minutes for questions.

308
0:46:14.000 --> 0:46:19.200
Do you have any questions? Okay.

309
0:46:19.200 --> 0:46:37.880
Amazing talk. I have just one question. What about advertising in podcasts? Is there some

310
0:46:37.880 --> 0:46:43.520
way to advertising and advertising a review podcast?

311
0:46:43.520 --> 0:46:50.920
There are many, many ways for advertising a podcast. At Adores, my company, we work

312
0:46:50.920 --> 0:47:01.000
on recommendation and paid recommendation. Historically, there were two kinds of ads

313
0:47:01.000 --> 0:47:10.840
on the podcasts, either from the host and it can be a host rate or automatically inserted

314
0:47:10.840 --> 0:47:19.080
or on the app. We still have the two of them. I hope that eventually we can find a way to

315
0:47:19.080 --> 0:47:31.600
make the host and the app work together so that they build bigger audience together.

316
0:47:31.600 --> 0:47:36.880
Thank you. Thank you for your talk. I have two questions. How do I move my existing feed?

317
0:47:36.880 --> 0:47:41.680
If I want to host it on Castapod, that's my first question. What features which are in

318
0:47:41.680 --> 0:47:47.680
the Podcasting 2.0 spec, you have this whole list of all these features. Some of you have

319
0:47:47.680 --> 0:47:53.360
implemented. What are you working on next to implement in Castapod?

320
0:47:53.360 --> 0:48:02.000
First one, Castapod has an import feature. As soon as you have your Castapod instance

321
0:48:02.000 --> 0:48:12.760
ready, you copy paste the RSS feed URL, you click import, and it fetches everything. About

322
0:48:12.760 --> 0:48:26.040
the features, we don't have all of them implemented yet. We're working on them one step at a time.

323
0:48:26.040 --> 0:48:31.840
You said the podcast index don't host anything illegal. What's your restriction is the podcast

324
0:48:31.840 --> 0:48:40.440
index in? You said the podcast index doesn't host any illegal content. I wonder what your

325
0:48:40.440 --> 0:48:50.760
restriction the podcast index is hosted in? I'm sorry. I didn't hear your question.

326
0:48:50.760 --> 0:48:58.920
You said the podcast index doesn't host anything illegal, but it allows everything legal. As

327
0:48:58.920 --> 0:49:10.680
long as they know it. What's your restriction is it hosted in? What country's laws?

328
0:49:10.680 --> 0:49:22.280
Is it United States or Germany? It's a US corporation. It's a US company. I assume it's

329
0:49:22.280 --> 0:49:34.680
US laws. The only example that I saw are mostly people who copied podcasts.

330
0:49:34.680 --> 0:49:40.600
Something that you have to know is that the podcast industry is still very young. It's

331
0:49:40.600 --> 0:49:49.680
a very young 20 years old industry. Young because it hasn't been monetized as other

332
0:49:49.680 --> 0:50:01.520
countries. When there is not that much money involved, you get less problems. Obviously,

333
0:50:01.520 --> 0:50:11.120
when it's bigger and when the money is flowing, we'll have some other issues. That's for sure.

334
0:50:11.120 --> 0:50:17.000
A very few questions because the time is up. My question is about the transcription. Does

335
0:50:17.000 --> 0:50:24.960
Castapod help us to transcript or do we have to upload our own transcript? Our own tools?

336
0:50:24.960 --> 0:50:33.080
Right now, Castapod allows you to embed your transcripts within, but we are working on

337
0:50:33.080 --> 0:50:39.800
the solution that will make it for you. We've been working on that for years and it's going

338
0:50:39.800 --> 0:50:47.760
to be out very soon. We have just a few questions on the chat.

339
0:50:47.760 --> 0:51:00.000
One is, does podcasting 2.0 address stuff like integrating Bittorrent with podcast RSS?

340
0:51:00.000 --> 0:51:23.600
At this point, too. It does not address Bittorrent yet. It's pretty hard because it's pretty

341
0:51:23.600 --> 0:51:35.440
hard to get something that works fluently. That's something that's on the table, but

342
0:51:35.440 --> 0:51:53.520
it's not going to be here very, very soon. The next question was about hosting providers.

343
0:51:53.520 --> 0:51:59.000
So what do you think about podcast hosting providers that conform to the standard but

344
0:51:59.000 --> 0:52:03.760
host short version on the actual podcast forcing you to download their app to finish listening

345
0:52:03.760 --> 0:52:10.880
to it while they're doing whatever they want to? I just think you shouldn't use them.

346
0:52:10.880 --> 0:52:16.720
You should go someplace where you have control, not the hosting company.

347
0:52:16.720 --> 0:52:22.240
Thank you very much. Thank you. If you have other questions, I'll

348
0:52:22.240 --> 0:52:22.880
be around.
