1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.640
First of all, thank you for coming here to this session.

2
0:00:08.640 --> 0:00:14.080
I think it's fantastic to have an audience who is potentially interested with regulation

3
0:00:14.080 --> 0:00:16.560
and compliance.

4
0:00:16.560 --> 0:00:25.240
This is something that impacts all of us as a community, as our users, consumers, and

5
0:00:25.240 --> 0:00:27.860
also from a work perspective.

6
0:00:27.860 --> 0:00:34.600
So I think it's really important to be able to understand what are the impacts of regulations,

7
0:00:34.600 --> 0:00:41.960
compliance, certifications, when we are developing software, when we are sharing our work from

8
0:00:41.960 --> 0:00:49.360
a, I would say, a community perspective, but also when that work goes into production on

9
0:00:49.360 --> 0:00:52.440
systems, critical systems.

10
0:00:52.440 --> 0:00:54.760
So thank you for being here for that.

11
0:00:54.760 --> 0:01:03.840
Today we have the unique opportunity to have some of the folks who wrote, or at least

12
0:01:03.840 --> 0:01:12.680
review wrote, some of the legislation directives, like the Cyber Resilience Act.

13
0:01:12.680 --> 0:01:18.520
And we will go through a couple of lightning talks, because I think it's really important

14
0:01:18.520 --> 0:01:19.840
to set the scene.

15
0:01:19.840 --> 0:01:26.200
So we could start discussing about having a panel, but if we don't understand the overall

16
0:01:26.200 --> 0:01:30.720
construct of those regulations, that's going to be hard.

17
0:01:30.720 --> 0:01:36.700
So I would like to have a warm welcome from Benjamin here.

18
0:01:36.700 --> 0:01:40.560
If you can give him a bit of love.

19
0:01:40.560 --> 0:01:42.440
Thank you.

20
0:01:42.440 --> 0:01:43.500
Thank you.

21
0:01:43.500 --> 0:01:48.980
So we are really honored to have the European Commission here to help us with this.

22
0:01:48.980 --> 0:01:49.980
So thank you.

23
0:01:49.980 --> 0:01:54.400
Benjamin, up to you.

24
0:01:54.400 --> 0:01:55.720
Thank you very much.

25
0:01:55.720 --> 0:02:00.640
Thank you so much for having me and also for showing interest in our work.

26
0:02:00.640 --> 0:02:06.440
That will maybe affect some of you, but most of you probably won't be affected by it.

27
0:02:06.440 --> 0:02:11.680
I mean, as a commission, we are always trying very hard to reach out to all the people that

28
0:02:11.680 --> 0:02:16.000
could potentially be affected by our regulation, but it's sometimes a bit difficult.

29
0:02:16.000 --> 0:02:21.520
I mean, it's often mostly large companies that have the resources to actually engage

30
0:02:21.520 --> 0:02:22.520
with us.

31
0:02:22.520 --> 0:02:27.320
So I'm really happy to be here, and I'm so glad that so many of you decided also to stay

32
0:02:27.320 --> 0:02:30.120
for this panel.

33
0:02:30.120 --> 0:02:35.320
So the Cyber Resilience Act is a new proposal of the European Commission.

34
0:02:35.320 --> 0:02:42.760
It intends to improve the cybersecurity of hardware and software products.

35
0:02:42.760 --> 0:02:45.360
It's intended to complete a puzzle.

36
0:02:45.360 --> 0:02:50.280
So there's already other legislation at union level on cybersecurity.

37
0:02:50.280 --> 0:02:56.720
Most notably, there is the NIS directive, which has recently been reformed.

38
0:02:56.720 --> 0:03:00.940
The NIS directive focuses more on the users of hardware and software.

39
0:03:00.940 --> 0:03:06.640
So it ensures that large companies, critical infrastructure providers and so forth take

40
0:03:06.640 --> 0:03:10.760
security seriously, do their patches regularly and all that.

41
0:03:10.760 --> 0:03:15.520
But the Cyber Resilience Act now focuses on the other side, on the manufacturers of these

42
0:03:15.520 --> 0:03:16.520
products.

43
0:03:16.520 --> 0:03:22.200
And, I mean, I know that many of you are probably not dealing with policy every day, and it's

44
0:03:22.200 --> 0:03:25.080
particular not with European Union policy.

45
0:03:25.080 --> 0:03:30.800
So I've just added one slide at the very beginning to quickly explain to you what the commission

46
0:03:30.800 --> 0:03:34.800
is and where we are in this process and who the other players are.

47
0:03:34.800 --> 0:03:37.980
So yeah, this is highly simplified.

48
0:03:37.980 --> 0:03:42.040
It's much more complicated than that, unfortunately.

49
0:03:42.040 --> 0:03:47.280
So I work for the European Commission for the director general connect.

50
0:03:47.280 --> 0:03:52.580
It's like the director generals, they are like departments within the commission.

51
0:03:52.580 --> 0:03:58.960
So we mostly deal with telecommunications, internet, emerging technologies and so forth.

52
0:03:58.960 --> 0:04:05.360
And it is the European Commission that makes legislative proposals in the European Union.

53
0:04:05.360 --> 0:04:11.320
So we write the draft, and then we propose this draft to the so-called co-legislators.

54
0:04:11.320 --> 0:04:17.600
That's European Parliament and where you have the members of European Parliament, so parliamentarians,

55
0:04:17.600 --> 0:04:21.440
and the council that represents the 27 member states.

56
0:04:21.440 --> 0:04:26.600
And these two institutions, they analyze the commission's proposal, they come up with their

57
0:04:26.600 --> 0:04:32.560
own positions, and once they've done that, they negotiate with one another.

58
0:04:32.560 --> 0:04:38.600
And at the very end, once they agree on a common line, a common position, they adopt

59
0:04:38.600 --> 0:04:40.440
the text and it enters into force.

60
0:04:40.440 --> 0:04:41.520
It becomes a law.

61
0:04:41.520 --> 0:04:42.840
So this is basically how it works.

62
0:04:42.840 --> 0:04:44.240
It's very simplified.

63
0:04:44.240 --> 0:04:51.480
So our proposal came out on 15 September 2022, so in autumn.

64
0:04:51.480 --> 0:04:54.580
And it's now with parliament and council.

65
0:04:54.580 --> 0:04:56.560
Parliament has not yet started discussing it.

66
0:04:56.560 --> 0:05:00.360
They're still sorting out which committees will be in charge of it.

67
0:05:00.360 --> 0:05:02.640
But council is already at full speed.

68
0:05:02.640 --> 0:05:05.920
There are regular meetings every second Wednesday.

69
0:05:05.920 --> 0:05:09.760
The council is meeting to discuss the text proposed by the commission.

70
0:05:09.760 --> 0:05:11.560
So that's just for your background.

71
0:05:11.560 --> 0:05:16.000
And now we'll talk about the substance of the proposal.

72
0:05:16.000 --> 0:05:19.400
So what are we trying to achieve?

73
0:05:19.400 --> 0:05:25.840
So we want to reduce the number of vulnerabilities in hardware and software products.

74
0:05:25.840 --> 0:05:33.240
Of course we know that it's an unrealistic goal to aim for zero vulnerabilities in products.

75
0:05:33.240 --> 0:05:34.800
And this is what this slide represents.

76
0:05:34.800 --> 0:05:40.000
So the cheese represents a hardware software product filled with holes.

77
0:05:40.000 --> 0:05:43.360
I mean, I know not all are filled with holes, but many are.

78
0:05:43.360 --> 0:05:48.380
And I mean, we attempt to reduce the number of such security holes in hardware and software

79
0:05:48.380 --> 0:05:52.440
products through legislation.

80
0:05:52.440 --> 0:05:57.920
And yeah, I will just get right into the main elements of the proposal to give you an overview

81
0:05:57.920 --> 0:06:00.980
and then I will provide some more details.

82
0:06:00.980 --> 0:06:06.360
So it's all about providing cybersecurity rules for hardware and software products when

83
0:06:06.360 --> 0:06:07.760
they're placed on the market.

84
0:06:07.760 --> 0:06:12.260
So placing on the market entails that we're talking about commercial activities here.

85
0:06:12.260 --> 0:06:16.320
So companies that make money with hardware and software products, they will have to follow

86
0:06:16.320 --> 0:06:17.320
these rules.

87
0:06:17.320 --> 0:06:20.440
We're using a well-established framework.

88
0:06:20.440 --> 0:06:23.320
It's called the new legislative framework.

89
0:06:23.320 --> 0:06:27.880
It's been used in the past by the European Union to regulate other products such as toys

90
0:06:27.880 --> 0:06:31.060
or machinery or electrical equipment.

91
0:06:31.060 --> 0:06:34.520
And you may not know it, but you're all actually very familiar with it.

92
0:06:34.520 --> 0:06:39.980
So whenever you see a product that has the CE marking on it, CE, I will show it later,

93
0:06:39.980 --> 0:06:44.640
like you have it, for example, on laptops or iPhone chargers and such things.

94
0:06:44.640 --> 0:06:49.220
So this is all new legislative framework regulation then.

95
0:06:49.220 --> 0:06:54.520
What we do in the proposal is we establish obligations for three types of economic operators

96
0:06:54.520 --> 0:06:55.520
for the manufacturers.

97
0:06:55.520 --> 0:06:58.960
I mean, that's the core element, of course, of the proposal.

98
0:06:58.960 --> 0:07:01.080
But then there are also the distributors.

99
0:07:01.080 --> 0:07:06.880
These are brick and mortar stores, online shops, and also importers that place products

100
0:07:06.880 --> 0:07:10.400
on the European market that have been developed in third countries.

101
0:07:10.400 --> 0:07:14.600
And the importers and the distributors, they don't have to, I mean, they don't do secure

102
0:07:14.600 --> 0:07:15.600
coding, of course.

103
0:07:15.600 --> 0:07:19.480
They're just selling products, but they have to ensure that the products that they are

104
0:07:19.480 --> 0:07:27.280
selling are, like, in line, I mean, that they comply with the Cyber Resilience Act.

105
0:07:27.280 --> 0:07:34.600
One of the core novelties of our proposal is that it does not just cover rules for the

106
0:07:34.600 --> 0:07:38.960
placing on the market, so what the product should look like, but it also covers the period

107
0:07:38.960 --> 0:07:41.120
after that, the entire life cycle.

108
0:07:41.120 --> 0:07:43.840
So I mean, you all know that for cybersecurity.

109
0:07:43.840 --> 0:07:48.920
It's extremely important that you keep tracking your products, that you ensure that when you

110
0:07:48.920 --> 0:07:53.000
discover new vulnerabilities, that you fix them, you mitigate them, you provide patches

111
0:07:53.000 --> 0:07:54.240
and so forth.

112
0:07:54.240 --> 0:07:58.720
And this is part of our proposal that for a period of five years after the placing on

113
0:07:58.720 --> 0:08:00.760
the market of a product, you do that.

114
0:08:00.760 --> 0:08:04.160
You provide security updates.

115
0:08:04.160 --> 0:08:10.480
One essential element of any new legislative framework regulation is harmonized standards.

116
0:08:10.480 --> 0:08:16.960
So the rules that we propose in the Cyber Resilience Act, they are very high level, technology

117
0:08:16.960 --> 0:08:19.240
neutral, objective oriented.

118
0:08:19.240 --> 0:08:22.160
I mean, if you go through the proposal, you will see they are really high level.

119
0:08:22.160 --> 0:08:31.360
It's more like on the level of provide a secure by default configuration, take care of access

120
0:08:31.360 --> 0:08:36.760
management, make sure data is handled confidentially and so forth.

121
0:08:36.760 --> 0:08:43.880
So really high level, but then we have the standards that will be developed by the European

122
0:08:43.880 --> 0:08:45.920
Standardization Organizations.

123
0:08:45.920 --> 0:08:46.920
You may have heard of them.

124
0:08:46.920 --> 0:08:49.840
They are called SANS-ANILAC and ETSI.

125
0:08:49.840 --> 0:08:52.040
And they are voluntary.

126
0:08:52.040 --> 0:08:57.500
You don't need to use these standards, but they will help you write secure products.

127
0:08:57.500 --> 0:09:01.360
And then there is also the conformity assessment.

128
0:09:01.360 --> 0:09:06.040
So manufacturers, they will have to demonstrate that their products are actually compliant,

129
0:09:06.040 --> 0:09:08.840
but I will explain that in more detail later.

130
0:09:08.840 --> 0:09:10.520
And finally, there is the market surveillance.

131
0:09:10.520 --> 0:09:14.600
So in all the member states, you will have authorities that can check out the products

132
0:09:14.600 --> 0:09:22.000
and approach manufacturers, ask them to remediate vulnerabilities, eliminate risks, and if they

133
0:09:22.000 --> 0:09:26.560
don't comply, even hand out fines.

134
0:09:26.560 --> 0:09:33.740
So the scope of the proposal, it's hardware and software products, products, not services.

135
0:09:33.740 --> 0:09:39.000
So when I say hardware products and software products, I mean final products such as laptops

136
0:09:39.000 --> 0:09:47.920
or operating systems, but also components such as CPUs, hard drives, software libraries,

137
0:09:47.920 --> 0:09:50.060
and so forth.

138
0:09:50.060 --> 0:09:52.460
We don't regulate services.

139
0:09:52.460 --> 0:09:55.600
So software as a service is outside the scope of this proposal.

140
0:09:55.600 --> 0:09:59.640
That's already regulated by the NIS directive, which I mentioned earlier.

141
0:09:59.640 --> 0:10:04.560
But we do regulate something that we call remote data processing solutions.

142
0:10:04.560 --> 0:10:09.940
So often today, products, they actually come with some cloud or other elements such as

143
0:10:09.940 --> 0:10:12.200
many mobile applications.

144
0:10:12.200 --> 0:10:16.480
They usually they access data in the cloud, and these are essential functionalities of

145
0:10:16.480 --> 0:10:17.840
the program.

146
0:10:17.840 --> 0:10:23.620
And then you would also have to ensure the security of these remote data processing solutions.

147
0:10:23.620 --> 0:10:27.120
As I already explained, we only regulate commercial products.

148
0:10:27.120 --> 0:10:31.960
So anything that is non-commercial is outside the scope, including open source when it's

149
0:10:31.960 --> 0:10:33.380
non-commercial.

150
0:10:33.380 --> 0:10:37.320
But on the other hand, open source that is commercial, I mean there are a lot of large

151
0:10:37.320 --> 0:10:42.320
commercial projects, I'm sure you're aware of them, they would be covered.

152
0:10:42.320 --> 0:10:46.160
And then we exclude certain products that are already regulated by other regulations

153
0:10:46.160 --> 0:10:48.520
such as cars or medical devices.

154
0:10:48.520 --> 0:10:54.800
Yeah, I mean why did we choose to exclude non-commercial open source software from the

155
0:10:54.800 --> 0:10:55.800
scope?

156
0:10:55.800 --> 0:10:59.880
Well, there are a few reasons, and first of all, this is standard practice for any new

157
0:10:59.880 --> 0:11:03.740
legislative framework product regulation at union level.

158
0:11:03.740 --> 0:11:07.040
We only focus on commercial activities.

159
0:11:07.040 --> 0:11:10.920
But also in the case of open source, there are some more special considerations that

160
0:11:10.920 --> 0:11:11.920
we took.

161
0:11:11.920 --> 0:11:17.520
So first of all, would it be fair to regulate someone that does not make a profit with a

162
0:11:17.520 --> 0:11:18.520
product, right?

163
0:11:18.520 --> 0:11:19.600
I mean, and we think it would not.

164
0:11:19.600 --> 0:11:24.280
And wouldn't we be setting the wrong incentives to regulate someone who doesn't make money

165
0:11:24.280 --> 0:11:25.280
with it, right?

166
0:11:25.280 --> 0:11:31.160
Would you keep developing something if you're asked to like follow regulation and you're

167
0:11:31.160 --> 0:11:32.640
not even earning money with it?

168
0:11:32.640 --> 0:11:36.840
So we would be setting the wrong incentives, that's why we decided to exclude them.

169
0:11:36.840 --> 0:11:40.920
And then of course we also know that open source, I mean, it's critical often from a

170
0:11:40.920 --> 0:11:46.720
cybersecurity perspective, but it's just as critical from an innovation and growth perspective.

171
0:11:46.720 --> 0:11:52.320
I mean, there are so many small companies, medium-sized companies that use your components,

172
0:11:52.320 --> 0:11:57.320
your products, free of charge to develop on top other products and services.

173
0:11:57.320 --> 0:12:01.440
And for them it's crucial that they have access to this resource.

174
0:12:01.440 --> 0:12:04.440
And that's, I mean, we are fully aware of that.

175
0:12:04.440 --> 0:12:10.500
And my colleague, Rice, he will, I mean, he will later on the panel also explain to you

176
0:12:10.500 --> 0:12:17.200
in how many other ways we support open source as the European Commission.

177
0:12:17.200 --> 0:12:21.840
So here in a nutshell, the obligations that manufacturers of commercial products would

178
0:12:21.840 --> 0:12:24.080
have to comply with.

179
0:12:24.080 --> 0:12:28.820
I mean, first you do a risk assessment of your product during the design phase.

180
0:12:28.820 --> 0:12:33.560
Then you comply with the essential requirements that are in the regulation.

181
0:12:33.560 --> 0:12:39.040
I explained earlier what they look like, these high-level objective-oriented requirements.

182
0:12:39.040 --> 0:12:44.400
Then you establish vulnerability handling processes such as a coordinated vulnerability

183
0:12:44.400 --> 0:12:47.440
disclosure policy.

184
0:12:47.440 --> 0:12:51.960
And yeah, of course, I mean, with any legislation you will have to document in which way you

185
0:12:51.960 --> 0:12:53.480
comply.

186
0:12:53.480 --> 0:12:56.960
This would be called a technical file.

187
0:12:56.960 --> 0:13:00.320
And once you've done all that, once you've done the conformity assessment, you can affix

188
0:13:00.320 --> 0:13:02.540
the CE marking to your product.

189
0:13:02.540 --> 0:13:07.720
And then for a period of five years, you will be required to handle the vulnerabilities

190
0:13:07.720 --> 0:13:10.840
that arise in your products.

191
0:13:10.840 --> 0:13:15.960
On top of that, there's also an obligation to report critical vulnerabilities to our

192
0:13:15.960 --> 0:13:18.080
cybersecurity agency.

193
0:13:18.080 --> 0:13:22.440
We are talking about vulnerabilities that are already exploited in the wild by criminal

194
0:13:22.440 --> 0:13:26.920
actors, but that have not been necessarily fixed.

195
0:13:26.920 --> 0:13:33.320
And this is for the purpose of helping national authorities mitigate risks in critical infrastructure

196
0:13:33.320 --> 0:13:36.240
and so forth.

197
0:13:36.240 --> 0:13:39.640
Here's one example of how we are also trying to help the community.

198
0:13:39.640 --> 0:13:45.440
So in the Article 11, which is about the reporting requirements for manufacturers, we require

199
0:13:45.440 --> 0:13:49.920
them whenever they integrate a component and they discover a vulnerability in it, and this

200
0:13:49.920 --> 0:13:55.760
could be an open source component, that they notify the entity or the person that maintains

201
0:13:55.760 --> 0:13:56.760
this component.

202
0:13:56.760 --> 0:13:59.140
I mean, so people like you often, for example.

203
0:13:59.140 --> 0:14:03.680
So for example, when you go from GitHub, when you source a component and then you discover

204
0:14:03.680 --> 0:14:08.760
a vulnerability, at least you should reach out to the maintainer and inform them of the

205
0:14:08.760 --> 0:14:09.760
vulnerability.

206
0:14:09.760 --> 0:14:11.400
Ideally do more.

207
0:14:11.400 --> 0:14:15.040
Maybe even provide code to fix it.

208
0:14:15.040 --> 0:14:18.820
So here is how it works as regards components.

209
0:14:18.820 --> 0:14:24.360
This is an example of a smartphone manufacturer that builds a smartphone.

210
0:14:24.360 --> 0:14:25.440
So there will be some components.

211
0:14:25.440 --> 0:14:28.920
Here you see them on the left-hand side in blue.

212
0:14:28.920 --> 0:14:32.720
These are components that the manufacturer develops themselves.

213
0:14:32.720 --> 0:14:38.160
So they would not be placed on the market separately, but as part of the final product.

214
0:14:38.160 --> 0:14:42.340
And then for these components, you would not need to do a separate conformity assessment,

215
0:14:42.340 --> 0:14:44.760
but it would be part of the final product.

216
0:14:44.760 --> 0:14:46.040
But then there are other components.

217
0:14:46.040 --> 0:14:51.120
You see them on the right-hand side, such as the ones that are developed by upstream

218
0:14:51.120 --> 0:14:52.120
manufacturers.

219
0:14:52.120 --> 0:14:54.120
So here you see the RAM or the CPU.

220
0:14:54.120 --> 0:14:57.280
In that example, it would be manufactured by someone else.

221
0:14:57.280 --> 0:15:01.960
So these are placed on the market separately, and it would be the upstream manufacturer

222
0:15:01.960 --> 0:15:07.160
who would need to ensure the security of these components and to fix the CE marking.

223
0:15:07.160 --> 0:15:11.620
And of course, the manufacturer of the smartphone is responsible for the entire product, right?

224
0:15:11.620 --> 0:15:15.040
Just because you integrate a component of someone else doesn't mean you don't take

225
0:15:15.040 --> 0:15:21.240
any responsibility for it, but you would need to do due diligence when you integrate those

226
0:15:21.240 --> 0:15:22.400
components.

227
0:15:22.400 --> 0:15:28.560
Yeah, so these are the categories for the conformity assessment that we propose.

228
0:15:28.560 --> 0:15:35.500
For the vast majority of products, the default category, you would do the conformity assessment

229
0:15:35.500 --> 0:15:37.160
yourself as a manufacturer.

230
0:15:37.160 --> 0:15:40.240
You do not need to interact with any third party.

231
0:15:40.240 --> 0:15:43.680
But then there is a smaller list of critical products, which you can find in the annex

232
0:15:43.680 --> 0:15:45.360
of our proposal.

233
0:15:45.360 --> 0:15:48.220
That's roughly 10% of the scope.

234
0:15:48.220 --> 0:15:52.840
And there we require more stringent conformity assessment and sometimes even independent

235
0:15:52.840 --> 0:15:55.080
third party assessment.

236
0:15:55.080 --> 0:16:00.320
Examples of these more critical products are firewalls, CPUs, or operating systems.

237
0:16:00.320 --> 0:16:04.760
And then there is also a possibility for highly critical products.

238
0:16:04.760 --> 0:16:11.480
We are not making use of that now, but we are proposing that in the future we can add

239
0:16:11.480 --> 0:16:16.960
highly critical products to a list for which it would be necessary to undergo a mandatory

240
0:16:16.960 --> 0:16:18.300
certification.

241
0:16:18.300 --> 0:16:19.920
We do not have any products in mind.

242
0:16:19.920 --> 0:16:25.520
This is really just to future-proof the legislation because we all know that digital products

243
0:16:25.520 --> 0:16:29.400
permeate society more and more and we become more and more dependent on them.

244
0:16:29.400 --> 0:16:34.200
And there may be a point at which we will rely on such crucial products that we need

245
0:16:34.200 --> 0:16:36.800
even a higher level of assurance.

246
0:16:36.800 --> 0:16:40.280
I don't know, think human brain interfaces or something like that.

247
0:16:40.280 --> 0:16:41.520
I mean, yeah.

248
0:16:41.520 --> 0:16:42.520
Okay.

249
0:16:42.520 --> 0:16:46.840
This is the CE marking that you're all very familiar with.

250
0:16:46.840 --> 0:16:51.480
We are also trying to facilitate compliance for the manufacturers as much as possible.

251
0:16:51.480 --> 0:16:56.880
So we would be providing after the entry into force of the proposal compliance on how to

252
0:16:56.880 --> 0:17:05.600
– sorry – guidance on compliance in general, as well as examples how to do things in practice,

253
0:17:05.600 --> 0:17:10.760
for example, on how to delineate what is a commercial product, what is a non-commercial

254
0:17:10.760 --> 0:17:11.760
product.

255
0:17:11.760 --> 0:17:16.840
We will also, I mean, as I said, develop these harmonized standards.

256
0:17:16.840 --> 0:17:20.760
We are looking into providing funding through the Digital Europe Program – that's a European

257
0:17:20.760 --> 0:17:25.760
funding initiative – for national market surveillance authorities, but also for manufacturers

258
0:17:25.760 --> 0:17:27.620
to help them comply.

259
0:17:27.620 --> 0:17:34.080
But then, frankly, we are also counting on you, on the community, on software developers,

260
0:17:34.080 --> 0:17:38.840
on the market also, to come up with tools that can help facilitate compliance.

261
0:17:38.840 --> 0:17:42.880
I mean, many of these tools already exist, of course, such as static and dynamic code

262
0:17:42.880 --> 0:17:49.200
analysis tools, S-bomb generators, but, I mean, you name it, there can be any number

263
0:17:49.200 --> 0:17:54.320
of tools that could help facilitate compliance, maybe to generate some of the documentation

264
0:17:54.320 --> 0:18:00.080
automatically and, I mean, also be extremely open to ideas how to facilitate this, so feel

265
0:18:00.080 --> 0:18:04.800
free to approach me after the panel and we can discuss it.

266
0:18:04.800 --> 0:18:10.400
Here, this is the timeline, just for you to better understand, and this is also my last

267
0:18:10.400 --> 0:18:11.400
slide.

268
0:18:11.400 --> 0:18:15.200
So, as I said, we made the proposal on 15 September.

269
0:18:15.200 --> 0:18:17.920
We are now undergoing this legislative process.

270
0:18:17.920 --> 0:18:23.700
We are hoping to conclude it before the European elections in May 2024.

271
0:18:23.700 --> 0:18:28.600
And then, once it's done and enters into force, we will launch a request for standardisation

272
0:18:28.600 --> 0:18:31.520
with the European standardisation bodies.

273
0:18:31.520 --> 0:18:36.520
And then, 24 months later, it would enter into application, so that's when manufacturers

274
0:18:36.520 --> 0:18:41.320
would need to comply with the rules and also when the harmonised standards would become

275
0:18:41.320 --> 0:18:42.320
available.

276
0:18:42.320 --> 0:18:48.480
Yeah, so there's still plenty of time for you to help within the process, to reach out

277
0:18:48.480 --> 0:18:53.840
to members of Parliament if you have concern or to the member state authorities and get

278
0:18:53.840 --> 0:18:54.840
involved.

279
0:18:54.840 --> 0:18:59.240
We are, of course, also extremely interested in your views, so you can also reach out to

280
0:18:59.240 --> 0:19:00.240
us.

281
0:19:00.240 --> 0:19:03.320
I mean, I also brought some business parts, so later, if you're interested, you can have

282
0:19:03.320 --> 0:19:04.320
some.

283
0:19:04.320 --> 0:19:07.680
And, yeah, I mean, I'm extremely looking forward to the discussion now.

284
0:19:07.680 --> 0:19:08.680
Thanks.

285
0:19:08.680 --> 0:19:11.560
Sorry for being so fast, but I only have 15 minutes.

286
0:19:11.560 --> 0:19:12.560
Thank you, Benjamin.

287
0:19:12.560 --> 0:19:22.400
So, I don't know if you saw me moving around during the talk, but we were discussing cyber

288
0:19:22.400 --> 0:19:26.800
resilience and also potential software defect.

289
0:19:26.800 --> 0:19:33.040
I just escorted a bug outside how convenient it was, so saving a bug.

290
0:19:33.040 --> 0:19:43.240
So now we're transitioning to Martin from NLNet Labs and he's going to give us his point

291
0:19:43.240 --> 0:19:53.120
of view of the CRA based on from an NGO, so a non-government agency or office, organisation,

292
0:19:53.120 --> 0:19:54.200
sorry.

293
0:19:54.200 --> 0:19:59.000
So this is a different approach.

294
0:19:59.000 --> 0:20:06.840
And, yeah, they are dealing with DNS, so that might be an important infrastructure element

295
0:20:06.840 --> 0:20:10.720
to consider in this topic.

296
0:20:10.720 --> 0:20:19.800
One more come from Martin, please.

297
0:20:19.800 --> 0:20:20.800
Good morning, everyone.

298
0:20:20.800 --> 0:20:27.360
So, I'm really grateful that Benjamin just did the hard work of explaining the legislation

299
0:20:27.360 --> 0:20:33.560
and for me the, I suppose, easier part of reacting to it.

300
0:20:33.560 --> 0:20:35.880
So my name is Martin Arzter.

301
0:20:35.880 --> 0:20:42.080
I work for NLNet Labs, which is a non-profit R&D organisation.

302
0:20:42.080 --> 0:20:45.320
We make open source software for the internet.

303
0:20:45.320 --> 0:20:51.040
I stole this terminology from a great report from quite a while ago.

304
0:20:51.040 --> 0:20:57.080
And what we do is we develop internet standards or we contribute to the development of internet

305
0:20:57.080 --> 0:21:01.080
standards and we make implementations.

306
0:21:01.080 --> 0:21:05.040
And the specific area of focus that we have...

307
0:21:05.040 --> 0:21:10.440
The mic closer to you.

308
0:21:10.440 --> 0:21:14.040
I will...

309
0:21:14.040 --> 0:21:18.600
So the specific work that we do is we develop, we contribute to the development of internet

310
0:21:18.600 --> 0:21:24.000
standards and we make implementations in software that are open source.

311
0:21:24.000 --> 0:21:26.320
And we've been doing this for two decades.

312
0:21:26.320 --> 0:21:32.680
We make software in the areas of DNS and we make software in the area of routing, specifically

313
0:21:32.680 --> 0:21:33.880
routing safety.

314
0:21:33.880 --> 0:21:38.840
And what we also do is we try to bring that knowledge to policymakers and that's what

315
0:21:38.840 --> 0:21:44.400
I'm doing hopefully today.

316
0:21:44.400 --> 0:21:50.120
So Benjamin just talked about the scoping and he mentioned that most of us would be

317
0:21:50.120 --> 0:21:52.040
out of scope.

318
0:21:52.040 --> 0:21:57.560
And when I read the proposal in September, October, I wasn't so sure.

319
0:21:57.560 --> 0:21:59.920
And I think that's something we should discuss.

320
0:21:59.920 --> 0:22:07.560
So there is a recital in the text that basically reads free and open source software should

321
0:22:07.560 --> 0:22:14.800
not be covered by this regulation, which is I think we should be very happy that the Commission

322
0:22:14.800 --> 0:22:24.320
is aware of open source and has taken concern to actually address this in new legislation

323
0:22:24.320 --> 0:22:25.880
that they come up with.

324
0:22:25.880 --> 0:22:31.720
I think that is something we should celebrate much like the fact that open source has been

325
0:22:31.720 --> 0:22:33.120
here for 25 years.

326
0:22:33.120 --> 0:22:39.520
So maybe a little warm round of applause just to acknowledge that we've been heard.

327
0:22:39.520 --> 0:22:46.320
And what I want to talk about today is the fact that there's a clause here and it says

328
0:22:46.320 --> 0:22:50.320
outside the course of a commercial activity.

329
0:22:50.320 --> 0:22:52.480
And what is a commercial activity?

330
0:22:52.480 --> 0:22:53.640
There are some examples.

331
0:22:53.640 --> 0:22:56.120
It's not a defined term.

332
0:22:56.120 --> 0:23:00.880
And one of the examples that is relevant to my organization, to Nellet Labs, is specifically

333
0:23:00.880 --> 0:23:06.840
that what is called out is that if you charge a price for technical support services, then

334
0:23:06.840 --> 0:23:09.040
you are considered commercial.

335
0:23:09.040 --> 0:23:12.280
So the organization I work for is a registered charity.

336
0:23:12.280 --> 0:23:17.440
We make software, we develop standards, we give it away for free, we give away updates

337
0:23:17.440 --> 0:23:19.080
for free.

338
0:23:19.080 --> 0:23:21.860
And yet we employ people with mortgages.

339
0:23:21.860 --> 0:23:25.280
So the question is how are we supposed to make money?

340
0:23:25.280 --> 0:23:32.380
And we found a way, namely the network operators that use our software want it to be available

341
0:23:32.380 --> 0:23:33.380
long term.

342
0:23:33.380 --> 0:23:36.920
And they want there to be different implementations available.

343
0:23:36.920 --> 0:23:42.140
So they've chosen to pay us to provide support.

344
0:23:42.140 --> 0:23:48.640
And so this makes our work a commercial activity, at least in the way we read this text.

345
0:23:48.640 --> 0:23:53.400
I would be glad to be wrong about most of the slides I'm showing you today.

346
0:23:53.400 --> 0:23:55.560
And please tell me if I am.

347
0:23:55.560 --> 0:24:01.240
But that's why we got interested in this legislation.

348
0:24:01.240 --> 0:24:08.020
And there are some risks if you look at this exception, because if you have an expansive

349
0:24:08.020 --> 0:24:13.400
interpretation of the word commercial, then the exception is narrow.

350
0:24:13.400 --> 0:24:16.840
It's this balance, right, depending on how you interpret commercial.

351
0:24:16.840 --> 0:24:23.120
And if it's a narrow scope of exception, then what you create is a disincentive for open

352
0:24:23.120 --> 0:24:29.040
source developers who start working on something in their free time to professionalize.

353
0:24:29.040 --> 0:24:35.920
Because at some point when you hit this commercial qualifier, then you come into scope of regulation.

354
0:24:35.920 --> 0:24:41.260
And there's nothing bad about regulation per se, but we have to acknowledge that the step

355
0:24:41.260 --> 0:24:46.840
from not being regulated to be regulated is a change, right?

356
0:24:46.840 --> 0:24:51.920
And what we don't want to happen is for charities like an elite labs and others who make this

357
0:24:51.920 --> 0:24:58.160
kind of software to realize that the way they've been able to sustain their development is

358
0:24:58.160 --> 0:25:00.440
now disappearing.

359
0:25:00.440 --> 0:25:07.000
So what we don't want is for there to be an incentive to move to closed source software.

360
0:25:07.000 --> 0:25:12.280
And finally, especially in the area of DNS, what we want is product diversity.

361
0:25:12.280 --> 0:25:21.280
So it's not a good outcome if we go to a place where there's less organizations working on

362
0:25:21.280 --> 0:25:26.360
these projects, because with what we want is different implementations that do not share

363
0:25:26.360 --> 0:25:29.920
code for stability.

364
0:25:29.920 --> 0:25:31.480
So it's not just me.

365
0:25:31.480 --> 0:25:36.440
The OSI reacted to the response, and they said, and I like this quote a lot, the problem

366
0:25:36.440 --> 0:25:39.760
is not the lack of taxonomy of commercial.

367
0:25:39.760 --> 0:25:44.160
So the solution is not explaining what commercial is supposed to be.

368
0:25:44.160 --> 0:25:49.280
It is the very act of making commercial the qualification rather than deployment for trade.

369
0:25:49.280 --> 0:25:56.240
And what is relevant about this quote is that there's a very different, the act of maintaining

370
0:25:56.240 --> 0:26:02.680
and creating software, and the cost of that is very distinct from the act of profiting

371
0:26:02.680 --> 0:26:04.280
from its deployment.

372
0:26:04.280 --> 0:26:10.040
And if you confuse these two steps, then you and commercial may help you confuse those

373
0:26:10.040 --> 0:26:14.840
steps, then we get into this place.

374
0:26:14.840 --> 0:26:16.800
So that's about general scoping issues.

375
0:26:16.800 --> 0:26:23.200
I'd like now to move to specific concerns we have from an elite labs.

376
0:26:23.200 --> 0:26:24.800
And why do we have concerns?

377
0:26:24.800 --> 0:26:31.080
Because we have products, we make unbound the resolver, we make some other product.

378
0:26:31.080 --> 0:26:36.920
At least we believe it's not an unreasonable interpretation to consider the stuff we release,

379
0:26:36.920 --> 0:26:39.040
including binaries, to be products.

380
0:26:39.040 --> 0:26:40.200
And maybe we're wrong.

381
0:26:40.200 --> 0:26:42.320
I'd love to hear that.

382
0:26:42.320 --> 0:26:47.040
So if we are product, and if what we do is considered commercial, then there are some

383
0:26:47.040 --> 0:26:52.400
unintended consequences by being covered by this legislation.

384
0:26:52.400 --> 0:26:59.640
Because currently we are an outfit with 15 people, 14 of whom are either software engineers

385
0:26:59.640 --> 0:27:03.320
or developers.

386
0:27:03.320 --> 0:27:10.440
Every effort we put into proving that we're doing the right thing, the compliance bit,

387
0:27:10.440 --> 0:27:17.480
which is a logical part of any legislation, every effort that we spend on compliance will

388
0:27:17.480 --> 0:27:20.600
not be spent on securing our software.

389
0:27:20.600 --> 0:27:26.360
And the only reason why a charity like ours exists is making secure software, resilient

390
0:27:26.360 --> 0:27:30.200
software for internet infrastructure.

391
0:27:30.200 --> 0:27:37.360
And if you look at the annex three list of critical products, it doesn't take too much

392
0:27:37.360 --> 0:27:45.280
imagination to frame most of what we do as critical products in terms of this legislation.

393
0:27:45.280 --> 0:27:52.400
And I think Benjamin explained about the way to avoid having to call in third party auditors.

394
0:27:52.400 --> 0:27:57.800
But it depends on the availability of European standards that are applicable to our work.

395
0:27:57.800 --> 0:28:04.160
And in general, I think most of us are not engaged in the European policy process.

396
0:28:04.160 --> 0:28:09.320
And even less of us are involved at the European standards institutions.

397
0:28:09.320 --> 0:28:12.760
Because basically we have no need to be there at this point in time.

398
0:28:12.760 --> 0:28:15.080
And we have not had a need in the past.

399
0:28:15.080 --> 0:28:19.000
So at an outlet we work quite a lot on standardization.

400
0:28:19.000 --> 0:28:24.960
But it's at multi stakeholder forms, accessible to any party without payment, et cetera.

401
0:28:24.960 --> 0:28:30.320
And that's not how these European standardization institutions work, unfortunately.

402
0:28:30.320 --> 0:28:35.240
So the escape hatch, if you are a critical product, to not have to call in third party

403
0:28:35.240 --> 0:28:39.060
auditors may not actually be available in practice.

404
0:28:39.060 --> 0:28:46.440
And that means we will have a costly burden checking our processes, which does not actually

405
0:28:46.440 --> 0:28:48.920
contribute to the quality of code.

406
0:28:48.920 --> 0:28:54.960
And that's why I think this is a concern for us, or at least an unintended consequence.

407
0:28:54.960 --> 0:29:00.000
There's also text in there which requires you to fix all known vulnerabilities.

408
0:29:00.000 --> 0:29:03.920
And this does not have a regard for severity.

409
0:29:03.920 --> 0:29:09.680
And what this does is if you have to fix all known vulnerabilities, then this skews your

410
0:29:09.680 --> 0:29:15.020
engineering effort from practices that protect you against unknown vulnerabilities.

411
0:29:15.020 --> 0:29:19.400
So this is this I think this is not what it was actually intended.

412
0:29:19.400 --> 0:29:20.800
I'm just flagging it.

413
0:29:20.800 --> 0:29:24.280
Because we I think we want there to be good laws.

414
0:29:24.280 --> 0:29:28.040
And we want to help in a democracy to achieve those good laws.

415
0:29:28.040 --> 0:29:33.880
I mean, why if you live in a democracy and you like that, why not contribute, I suppose.

416
0:29:33.880 --> 0:29:38.240
Otherwise, there's not a lot of points.

417
0:29:38.240 --> 0:29:41.560
So there's also more detailed concerns.

418
0:29:41.560 --> 0:29:48.720
So for example, we currently have the opportunity to provide security updates to providers we

419
0:29:48.720 --> 0:29:52.120
know are extremely critical to the functioning of the Internet.

420
0:29:52.120 --> 0:29:57.760
So if we are about to release a patch and give full information about what it fixes,

421
0:29:57.760 --> 0:30:05.820
we can choose to provide a update just ahead of time to a, for example, root server operator

422
0:30:05.820 --> 0:30:12.480
or some other entity which is not equal in terms of importance to all of society.

423
0:30:12.480 --> 0:30:17.640
And the current text takes away our ability to do so because it requires us to do everything

424
0:30:17.640 --> 0:30:25.780
at the same time, which may not actually benefit security, which is the goal.

425
0:30:25.780 --> 0:30:31.280
There's also obligations to report incidents that actually relate to third party use of

426
0:30:31.280 --> 0:30:32.480
our software.

427
0:30:32.480 --> 0:30:35.360
So we don't do any operations.

428
0:30:35.360 --> 0:30:36.720
We just develop software.

429
0:30:36.720 --> 0:30:42.000
But if we are obliged to report incidents that relate to the use of our software, this

430
0:30:42.000 --> 0:30:47.480
gets into a conflict of our role of remediating vulnerabilities.

431
0:30:47.480 --> 0:30:53.160
And this is the case because these third parties may have some reason not to go public with

432
0:30:53.160 --> 0:30:54.920
an incident at first.

433
0:30:54.920 --> 0:31:01.840
If you create a conflict of interest in talking to us, then we may need longer to fix the

434
0:31:01.840 --> 0:31:06.480
vulnerability if there is such a thing.

435
0:31:06.480 --> 0:31:14.280
What we don't know, and this is more of an uncertainty, we don't know what constitutes

436
0:31:14.280 --> 0:31:16.440
substantial modification.

437
0:31:16.440 --> 0:31:23.360
So the whole idea that you trigger reassessment of your product for the CE marking, it hinges

438
0:31:23.360 --> 0:31:29.200
on the fact that when substantial modification is made, you need to do it again.

439
0:31:29.200 --> 0:31:33.920
And we currently don't know if that's a major release, minor release, patch release.

440
0:31:33.920 --> 0:31:37.280
We do quite a lot of releases.

441
0:31:37.280 --> 0:31:43.520
And depending on how this pans out, we may spend a lot of work doing compliance and less

442
0:31:43.520 --> 0:31:46.640
work of doing release engineering.

443
0:31:46.640 --> 0:31:54.600
Finally, there is some clause about time limited availability of software for testing purposes.

444
0:31:54.600 --> 0:31:59.240
I think that's fundamentally incompatible with how open source is done.

445
0:31:59.240 --> 0:32:04.760
Much of the points I've made today, we worked on together with ISE, the authors of Bind,

446
0:32:04.760 --> 0:32:06.560
among others.

447
0:32:06.560 --> 0:32:13.160
And on their website, you can download about 30 years of binaries, of all versions of Bind

448
0:32:13.160 --> 0:32:18.880
ever made, which is really helpful if you're trying to find issues, vulnerabilities, whatever

449
0:32:18.880 --> 0:32:21.120
you try to.

450
0:32:21.120 --> 0:32:23.640
But the...

451
0:32:23.640 --> 0:32:29.120
So what we don't want is for them to have to get this stuff offline, because I don't

452
0:32:29.120 --> 0:32:34.320
think it actually helps us reduce vulnerabilities.

453
0:32:34.320 --> 0:32:39.640
So if you are interested in this stuff, I recommend you to read further, because this

454
0:32:39.640 --> 0:32:45.880
was just my perspective, and Elnett Labs as a charity employing people that are getting

455
0:32:45.880 --> 0:32:51.560
paid full time to develop open source software is not very common, and I realize that.

456
0:32:51.560 --> 0:32:53.080
But you don't have to take it from me.

457
0:32:53.080 --> 0:32:56.240
You can also read about other responses.

458
0:32:56.240 --> 0:33:05.200
So there's the work of OSI, there's work by Open Forum Europe, Brussels-based think tank

459
0:33:05.200 --> 0:33:10.680
which collects voices from other organizations relating to open source, including commercial

460
0:33:10.680 --> 0:33:11.720
ones.

461
0:33:11.720 --> 0:33:17.040
And Simon, who's in the front here, maybe he can raise his hand, actually compiled a

462
0:33:17.040 --> 0:33:20.080
list of responses by other...

463
0:33:20.080 --> 0:33:25.720
So you can take a look yourself and have a...

464
0:33:25.720 --> 0:33:27.120
And give it some thought.

465
0:33:27.120 --> 0:33:32.560
I wanted also to quickly give a shout out to a blog written by Thomas DePierre.

466
0:33:32.560 --> 0:33:35.440
I'm hoping I'm not butchering your name.

467
0:33:35.440 --> 0:33:40.280
And it relates to supply chain thinking, how that's currently quite dominant in thinking

468
0:33:40.280 --> 0:33:42.520
about security for open source.

469
0:33:42.520 --> 0:33:49.480
And his point is basically supply chain thinking doesn't work if someone in this supply chain

470
0:33:49.480 --> 0:33:54.200
is not actually considering themselves to be a supplier.

471
0:33:54.200 --> 0:33:57.720
So that's it with respect to what I had to say.

472
0:33:57.720 --> 0:34:02.760
In summary, we believe that these goals that the Commission is trying to achieve are worthy

473
0:34:02.760 --> 0:34:03.760
goals.

474
0:34:03.760 --> 0:34:06.800
And as a consumer, I would like them to succeed.

475
0:34:06.800 --> 0:34:11.800
However, there's also some unintended consequences in their current proposal.

476
0:34:11.800 --> 0:34:18.360
And I think we should aim as a society to fix those.

477
0:34:18.360 --> 0:34:21.480
I'm very interested to hear your perspective.

478
0:34:21.480 --> 0:34:24.040
And for now, I'd like to thank you for your attention.

479
0:34:24.040 --> 0:34:26.040
And I'm looking forward to the panel.

480
0:34:26.040 --> 0:34:28.040
Thank you.

481
0:34:28.040 --> 0:34:34.480
Thank you, Martin.

482
0:34:34.480 --> 0:34:38.240
We hit 30 minutes with two different opinions and views.

483
0:34:38.240 --> 0:34:44.120
Is there some questions in the audience?

484
0:34:44.120 --> 0:34:45.120
Not yet?

485
0:34:45.120 --> 0:34:47.960
Oh, one, two.

486
0:34:47.960 --> 0:34:51.280
Two questions.

487
0:34:51.280 --> 0:34:56.680
I'm from the UK.

488
0:34:56.680 --> 0:35:02.080
So how does that affect other European countries that may be?

489
0:35:02.080 --> 0:35:05.080
Okay.

490
0:35:05.080 --> 0:35:09.440
How does it affect the UK and the UK working with Europe?

491
0:35:09.440 --> 0:35:12.440
We're still part of Europe after Brexit.

492
0:35:12.440 --> 0:35:18.240
And secondly, how does it affect what's happening in the US in terms of all the stuff that NIST

493
0:35:18.240 --> 0:35:24.200
is doing, particularly on, you know, from the executive order that happened in 2021?

494
0:35:24.200 --> 0:35:27.520
I couldn't hear the second question.

495
0:35:27.520 --> 0:35:32.160
The second question was how does this affect the US?

496
0:35:32.160 --> 0:35:34.320
So thanks a lot for that question.

497
0:35:34.320 --> 0:35:39.600
So for the cyber resilience act, we are applying the same principle as for any other union

498
0:35:39.600 --> 0:35:43.880
legislation that is about services or products.

499
0:35:43.880 --> 0:35:48.400
So whenever you provide a service or a product in the European Union, you have to comply

500
0:35:48.400 --> 0:35:50.680
with the rules of the European Union.

501
0:35:50.680 --> 0:35:56.560
So that means for the cyber resilience act, if you provide a hardware or software manufactured

502
0:35:56.560 --> 0:36:02.000
outside the European Union to consumers or other users within the Union, you would have

503
0:36:02.000 --> 0:36:04.000
to comply with the cyber resilience act.

504
0:36:04.000 --> 0:36:05.800
So there's absolutely no difference.

505
0:36:05.800 --> 0:36:07.480
It doesn't matter where you're located.

506
0:36:07.480 --> 0:36:11.240
If you want to sell your products here, then you have to comply.

507
0:36:11.240 --> 0:36:17.920
So there's also no risk that there would be an advantage for maybe manufacturers from

508
0:36:17.920 --> 0:36:22.280
America or so forth that they would not have to comply and therefore have lower costs.

509
0:36:22.280 --> 0:36:25.040
No, it's an elite level playing field.

510
0:36:25.040 --> 0:36:29.080
Everyone who wants to sell their products here would have to comply with the same rules.

511
0:36:29.080 --> 0:36:33.360
I hope that answers your question.

512
0:36:33.360 --> 0:36:51.360
Hi, why is policy the right place to put these measures into effect rather than a standardization's

513
0:36:51.360 --> 0:36:59.560
body like ISO, which already does a lot of the same things and provides people who want

514
0:36:59.560 --> 0:37:14.160
the guarantees associated with this reliability testing to select products that comply with

515
0:37:14.160 --> 0:37:16.880
the ISO requirements?

516
0:37:16.880 --> 0:37:23.360
Okay, if I understood the question, the question is why we think that a mandatory approach

517
0:37:23.360 --> 0:37:25.200
is necessary, right?

518
0:37:25.200 --> 0:37:26.200
Right.

519
0:37:26.200 --> 0:37:36.040
Why is the mandatory approach necessary instead of a voluntary approach that could be selected

520
0:37:36.040 --> 0:37:38.600
by consumers who want it?

521
0:37:38.600 --> 0:37:43.440
Yeah, I mean, the voluntary approach is the approach that we took basically for the last

522
0:37:43.440 --> 0:37:45.800
20 years, right?

523
0:37:45.800 --> 0:37:46.800
And it hasn't worked.

524
0:37:46.800 --> 0:37:51.200
I mean, we are not eager to regulate new sectors.

525
0:37:51.200 --> 0:37:57.200
I mean, especially when it comes to such innovation and growth fostering sectors such as hardware

526
0:37:57.200 --> 0:37:58.200
and software.

527
0:37:58.200 --> 0:38:01.600
So, I mean, that's one of the reasons why the Commission of the European Union for a

528
0:38:01.600 --> 0:38:04.680
long time decided not to regulate.

529
0:38:04.680 --> 0:38:11.640
But we see that, you know, despite of new standards coming out, development of lots

530
0:38:11.640 --> 0:38:21.760
of secure development, lifecycle, guidance, new programming languages that are memory

531
0:38:21.760 --> 0:38:23.160
safe, I mean, all this is coming.

532
0:38:23.160 --> 0:38:24.160
We see that.

533
0:38:24.160 --> 0:38:28.000
But nonetheless, I mean, the vulnerabilities, they are not going down.

534
0:38:28.000 --> 0:38:32.000
And we see actually more cybersecurity incidents than ever before.

535
0:38:32.000 --> 0:38:34.080
And this is why we chose to regulate.

536
0:38:34.080 --> 0:38:41.040
I mean, in our view, there is simply not sufficient incentive for the market to take cybersecurity

537
0:38:41.040 --> 0:38:43.040
as seriously as it should.

538
0:38:43.040 --> 0:38:45.280
I mean, you all know this.

539
0:38:45.280 --> 0:38:51.280
I mean, you have so many specific features in this market such as time to market.

540
0:38:51.280 --> 0:38:55.480
I mean, first mover advantage, who is the first one to build a platform wins basically

541
0:38:55.480 --> 0:38:56.480
the whole market.

542
0:38:56.480 --> 0:38:57.480
Yeah.

543
0:38:57.480 --> 0:39:02.320
So, under all these constraints, manufacturers do not have an incentive to prioritize cybersecurity.

544
0:39:02.320 --> 0:39:06.920
And we feel that this can only be fixed through regulation.

545
0:39:06.920 --> 0:39:07.920
Thank you.

546
0:39:07.920 --> 0:39:11.680
So, there is more questions to come, but we have a panel after.

547
0:39:11.680 --> 0:39:16.080
So you will be keep your question and ask your question after so that we can proceed

548
0:39:16.080 --> 0:39:18.920
with the last presentation.

549
0:39:18.920 --> 0:39:24.200
I was also thinking about the same thing as you, sir, about the ISO part.

550
0:39:24.200 --> 0:39:30.400
Working with customers and partners at Red Hat, I can tell you that they need a directive

551
0:39:30.400 --> 0:39:32.720
or a compliance based on the law.

552
0:39:32.720 --> 0:39:36.200
Otherwise, they will never apply the things.

553
0:39:36.200 --> 0:39:42.880
The next speaker, Omar, is going to introduce us to the other part, which is more like the

554
0:39:42.880 --> 0:39:49.360
defective product and what it means in terms of liability.

555
0:39:49.360 --> 0:39:55.240
So please welcome Omar with a round of applause.

556
0:39:55.240 --> 0:39:56.240
Thank you.

557
0:39:56.240 --> 0:39:57.240
You okay with that?

558
0:39:57.240 --> 0:39:58.240
Yeah, we can see you, right?

559
0:39:58.240 --> 0:40:03.240
I think Martin will show you how to use that.

560
0:40:03.240 --> 0:40:04.240
Yeah, I think it's...

561
0:40:04.240 --> 0:40:05.240
Yeah, perfect.

562
0:40:05.240 --> 0:40:06.240
Thank you.

563
0:40:06.240 --> 0:40:09.240
Thank you for the invitation.

564
0:40:09.240 --> 0:40:11.560
Thank you to be here.

565
0:40:11.560 --> 0:40:17.720
I'm going to try to not use too much legal terms because I think now we're going to enter

566
0:40:17.720 --> 0:40:23.080
a zone that if you're not a lawyer, you will not really understand what we're talking about.

567
0:40:23.080 --> 0:40:26.680
So I will kind of try to use more simple situations.

568
0:40:26.680 --> 0:40:32.960
I think the name of the proposal speaks by itself, Product Liability Directive.

569
0:40:32.960 --> 0:40:37.760
The PLD, as we call it, is about the liability.

570
0:40:37.760 --> 0:40:41.520
So I'm going to tell you, give you some examples.

571
0:40:41.520 --> 0:40:46.800
Boeing 737 Max, two of them crashed some years ago.

572
0:40:46.800 --> 0:40:52.240
An autonomous vehicle that crashed and killed a person.

573
0:40:52.240 --> 0:41:03.480
In South Korea, a lawnmower that went into a person, your mobile phone that overheats.

574
0:41:03.480 --> 0:41:07.760
All of these situations are what we call the liability.

575
0:41:07.760 --> 0:41:11.840
And all of them include softwares.

576
0:41:11.840 --> 0:41:16.560
So what Benjamin explained to you are the obligation that when you want to place your

577
0:41:16.560 --> 0:41:22.200
product in the union on the market, but when something goes wrong, someone has to pay the

578
0:41:22.200 --> 0:41:23.200
bill.

579
0:41:23.200 --> 0:41:28.080
This is how every system works in all countries.

580
0:41:28.080 --> 0:41:35.240
And what the product liability does tells you who is the liable person and what the

581
0:41:35.240 --> 0:41:39.960
victim has to show to claim the compensation.

582
0:41:39.960 --> 0:41:45.720
So the regime of the PLD exists since 1985.

583
0:41:45.720 --> 0:41:50.800
But as you know, the product of 1985 were not the one that we have today, including

584
0:41:50.800 --> 0:41:55.600
software, AI systems, IoT, et cetera.

585
0:41:55.600 --> 0:42:04.920
So what we have done is to redraft and re-clarify the regime that existed by including all softwares

586
0:42:04.920 --> 0:42:06.200
in it.

587
0:42:06.200 --> 0:42:12.840
Because as you know, and with the example that I gave to you, software can in some situation

588
0:42:12.840 --> 0:42:15.600
cause harm and cause a damage.

589
0:42:15.600 --> 0:42:22.800
So what the PLD does, and it says that the manufacturer is liable for damage caused by

590
0:42:22.800 --> 0:42:25.360
defect in their product.

591
0:42:25.360 --> 0:42:33.760
And the injured person, so in a tribunal or in a court, has to prove the damage, the existence

592
0:42:33.760 --> 0:42:41.600
of the damage, the defect in the product, and the link, what we in legal terms call

593
0:42:41.600 --> 0:42:46.640
the cause of relationship between the defect and the damage itself.

594
0:42:46.640 --> 0:42:52.480
If this is proved, the manufacturer has to compensate the victim or the family of the

595
0:42:52.480 --> 0:42:54.320
victim in case of death.

596
0:42:54.320 --> 0:42:56.680
So the manufacturer is defined.

597
0:42:56.680 --> 0:43:03.520
This is a definition that appears in all legislation, product legislation in the union.

598
0:43:03.520 --> 0:43:06.520
The damage, what damages are we talking about?

599
0:43:06.520 --> 0:43:10.880
Death, personal injury, damage to property.

600
0:43:10.880 --> 0:43:14.880
Think about an IoT boiler system in your house.

601
0:43:14.880 --> 0:43:19.520
Over hits, the house explodes, someone has to pay for that.

602
0:43:19.520 --> 0:43:23.760
That's a simple situation, but at least you see exactly what we're talking about.

603
0:43:23.760 --> 0:43:27.880
Data loss, data corruption, this is a new addition.

604
0:43:27.880 --> 0:43:34.880
So obviously the liability that you had until now covered any physical things, but as you

605
0:43:34.880 --> 0:43:38.840
know, you own stuff, even in the material world.

606
0:43:38.840 --> 0:43:43.840
When you talk about NFTs, why would you be covered if your painting burns because of

607
0:43:43.840 --> 0:43:51.280
your house, the explosion, let's say, or whatever, but you cannot get compensation if actually

608
0:43:51.280 --> 0:43:53.320
you lose your NFT?

609
0:43:53.320 --> 0:43:57.360
So all of this has been re-adapted and included in the regime.

610
0:43:57.360 --> 0:44:02.960
So these are the damages for which the manufacturer has to pay compensation in case there was

611
0:44:02.960 --> 0:44:07.880
a defect that caused the damage to one of them.

612
0:44:07.880 --> 0:44:12.600
So the entire notion of defect, and I'm going to try to explain a bit also what was the

613
0:44:12.600 --> 0:44:22.200
part of the revision, the entire idea of defect is that the product did not, let's say, had

614
0:44:22.200 --> 0:44:27.480
a lack of safety that a general person is expected to have.

615
0:44:27.480 --> 0:44:31.640
So your fire alarm does not detect the smoke.

616
0:44:31.640 --> 0:44:35.600
You are expecting that it would actually do it.

617
0:44:35.600 --> 0:44:43.360
If you have a computer and actually the software has so many vulnerabilities that you lose

618
0:44:43.360 --> 0:44:47.140
any of your data, you might expect that actually should not do it.

619
0:44:47.140 --> 0:44:52.200
So all of these are normally explained in quotes, and if you establish that there was

620
0:44:52.200 --> 0:44:57.400
a defect and that there was damage, then you get compensation.

621
0:44:57.400 --> 0:45:03.280
Defect does not mean that we're talking about a zero absence of bugs in a software, for

622
0:45:03.280 --> 0:45:04.280
instance.

623
0:45:04.280 --> 0:45:05.760
That's not what it means.

624
0:45:05.760 --> 0:45:07.560
Zero, it's impossible.

625
0:45:07.560 --> 0:45:08.900
You cannot have it.

626
0:45:08.900 --> 0:45:15.000
But you can have vulnerabilities that as a developer you should have expected or you

627
0:45:15.000 --> 0:45:16.760
should have foreseen.

628
0:45:16.760 --> 0:45:21.960
So all of these elements are taken into account to establish the liability of the manufacturer

629
0:45:21.960 --> 0:45:27.920
or manufacturer developer depends on which type of product we are talking about.

630
0:45:27.920 --> 0:45:35.000
So as I said, the liability has been revised, there are different adaptations of the regime

631
0:45:35.000 --> 0:45:40.640
for liability, the digital age, circular economy, this is about the substantial modification

632
0:45:40.640 --> 0:45:42.360
that we're talking about.

633
0:45:42.360 --> 0:45:48.400
The global value chains, this is a concept that we talk mostly in trade where a product

634
0:45:48.400 --> 0:45:54.860
comes from outside of the union, the manufacturer is established outside of the union and brings

635
0:45:54.860 --> 0:45:56.200
the product in the union.

636
0:45:56.200 --> 0:45:59.840
So you need to know who is the liable one.

637
0:45:59.840 --> 0:46:03.060
And then a better protection for victims.

638
0:46:03.060 --> 0:46:11.440
So basically what the new proposal or the new product liability directive proposed is

639
0:46:11.440 --> 0:46:17.160
to say that any software is a product, no matter how it's supplied or provided.

640
0:46:17.160 --> 0:46:21.920
So this obviously also includes any AI systems.

641
0:46:21.920 --> 0:46:27.120
No matter if it's a software as a service or anything that will be concerned as a service,

642
0:46:27.120 --> 0:46:32.160
all of them are software and all of them are products and all of them will be covered by

643
0:46:32.160 --> 0:46:34.160
the liability.

644
0:46:34.160 --> 0:46:37.960
But at the same time you also know that software do not work independently.

645
0:46:37.960 --> 0:46:46.000
You have what we call the digital service, the flow of data that feeds the your AI system

646
0:46:46.000 --> 0:46:47.000
for the training.

647
0:46:47.000 --> 0:46:52.600
All of them will be covered and all of the providers of those data, for instance, will

648
0:46:52.600 --> 0:46:57.960
be also covered by the liability in case something goes wrong.

649
0:46:57.960 --> 0:47:02.040
As we talk about already, there is the exception of open source software outside of a commercial

650
0:47:02.040 --> 0:47:03.520
activity.

651
0:47:03.520 --> 0:47:10.120
To be clear, outside of a commercial activity is the exception for any product.

652
0:47:10.120 --> 0:47:14.340
If a product is outside of a commercial activity, it's out.

653
0:47:14.340 --> 0:47:16.280
But what is a commercial activity?

654
0:47:16.280 --> 0:47:22.880
Well, if your software is sold, this is a commercial activity.

655
0:47:22.880 --> 0:47:28.680
If you provide services to the company that takes your open source software, this is a

656
0:47:28.680 --> 0:47:30.200
commercial activity.

657
0:47:30.200 --> 0:47:33.160
Those are examples of commercial activity.

658
0:47:33.160 --> 0:47:36.920
This is how it has been interpreted by the court.

659
0:47:36.920 --> 0:47:42.040
This is part of the court judgments and case law.

660
0:47:42.040 --> 0:47:48.680
You will have different situations, but these are some examples that I gave to you.

661
0:47:48.680 --> 0:47:52.080
The damages to data loss and corruption.

662
0:47:52.080 --> 0:47:54.840
The software updates and upgrades.

663
0:47:54.840 --> 0:48:02.000
Obviously your software or any type of product that are digital evolved during their lifetime.

664
0:48:02.000 --> 0:48:04.280
This has also to be taken into account.

665
0:48:04.280 --> 0:48:10.840
If you do not provide a software update or upgrade that was necessary to avoid the damage,

666
0:48:10.840 --> 0:48:12.800
you can be held liable.

667
0:48:12.800 --> 0:48:18.880
These are the different elements, but obviously I will not go into absolute details.

668
0:48:18.880 --> 0:48:23.920
Addressing the cyber vulnerabilities might also open a claim for damages.

669
0:48:23.920 --> 0:48:31.720
The evolution of an AI system through machine learning could also open a claim if the machine

670
0:48:31.720 --> 0:48:33.600
creates any damage.

671
0:48:33.600 --> 0:48:36.700
So that's a bit of the adaptation.

672
0:48:36.700 --> 0:48:41.560
The circular economy is the general concept of substantial modification.

673
0:48:41.560 --> 0:48:47.400
So obviously if someone substantially modifies a product, in this case a software, it should

674
0:48:47.400 --> 0:48:52.480
be the one who should be held liable if something happens, has a manufacturer or the developer

675
0:48:52.480 --> 0:48:58.680
of this software after he has done the substantial modification.

676
0:48:58.680 --> 0:49:05.600
The value chain is more related to the traders that imports the product in the union.

677
0:49:05.600 --> 0:49:12.520
As a victim you should not be blocked just because you do not know who is the manufacturer

678
0:49:12.520 --> 0:49:13.520
of the product.

679
0:49:13.520 --> 0:49:20.320
So anyone who is part of the value chain that brought the product in the union can be held

680
0:49:20.320 --> 0:49:21.320
liable.

681
0:49:21.320 --> 0:49:28.520
So through an importer, if you buy through an online marketplace, those entities could

682
0:49:28.520 --> 0:49:31.280
be held liable instead of the manufacturer.

683
0:49:31.280 --> 0:49:36.360
And then obviously if they have contract with the manufacturer itself, they can have recourse

684
0:49:36.360 --> 0:49:39.800
against him.

685
0:49:39.800 --> 0:49:48.560
The better protection, it's more for technical points, but it's how it's going to work in

686
0:49:48.560 --> 0:49:50.220
courts.

687
0:49:50.220 --> 0:49:53.480
You have situations that are so complicated.

688
0:49:53.480 --> 0:49:58.240
Let's take an AI system, explaining where the defect is in an AI system might be complex

689
0:49:58.240 --> 0:50:01.140
as a victim to show.

690
0:50:01.140 --> 0:50:06.640
So we created what we called in legal terms legal presumptions.

691
0:50:06.640 --> 0:50:12.400
If you have one of the, if the victim can prove one of those elements, you have what

692
0:50:12.400 --> 0:50:14.040
we call the presumption.

693
0:50:14.040 --> 0:50:19.280
So we presume that the product is defective and it has caused the damage.

694
0:50:19.280 --> 0:50:25.620
And if it's the case, then it is to the manufacturer to explain that actually it is not the case.

695
0:50:25.620 --> 0:50:33.180
So that is a legal tool that exists in every system, but we have adapted it to ensure that

696
0:50:33.180 --> 0:50:38.580
if something goes wrong, someone at least has a possibility to have a claim.

697
0:50:38.580 --> 0:50:41.520
It does not mean that you're liable.

698
0:50:41.520 --> 0:50:48.080
It just means that you can bring a claim to a court and make your case and explain why

699
0:50:48.080 --> 0:50:53.800
the product was defective and why you have a damage and why the manufacturer should be

700
0:50:53.800 --> 0:50:55.120
held liable.

701
0:50:55.120 --> 0:50:57.040
This is not an automatic situation.

702
0:50:57.040 --> 0:51:03.280
It's not because we have included software, for instance, in the scope of the legislation,

703
0:51:03.280 --> 0:51:05.200
that it means that you will be held liable.

704
0:51:05.200 --> 0:51:06.500
You need to have a damage.

705
0:51:06.500 --> 0:51:10.920
You need to have a plane that crashes because of the software that obliged the pilot to

706
0:51:10.920 --> 0:51:14.000
go down instead, to go up.

707
0:51:14.000 --> 0:51:20.080
The autonomous vehicle that goes into a wall, why there was nothing on the road.

708
0:51:20.080 --> 0:51:25.280
Those kinds of situations are the ones that at least allow a victim to make the claim

709
0:51:25.280 --> 0:51:29.280
and go in court and try to get the compensation.

710
0:51:29.280 --> 0:51:34.520
If the product was not defective, well, then there is no problem.

711
0:51:34.520 --> 0:51:41.480
And again, when we talk about software, this is not a zero bug that we're talking about.

712
0:51:41.480 --> 0:51:46.440
We are talking about expectation that you have about the software, the fact that your

713
0:51:46.440 --> 0:51:54.920
software should not overheat your boiler, the fact that the pilot, the software pilot

714
0:51:54.920 --> 0:51:59.120
in your plane should not push down while you're trying to go up.

715
0:51:59.120 --> 0:52:03.520
Those kinds of things, these are the situations that we're talking about.

716
0:52:03.520 --> 0:52:07.160
So these are a bit of technical situations.

717
0:52:07.160 --> 0:52:13.520
But we have what we call a disclosure of information.

718
0:52:13.520 --> 0:52:18.320
Only the manufacturer of the product itself knows the product.

719
0:52:18.320 --> 0:52:27.840
So as a victim, you need to have access to some sort of information, like the data used,

720
0:52:27.840 --> 0:52:34.680
any kind of evidences that could be of an help to create the claim.

721
0:52:34.680 --> 0:52:39.240
Obviously those information are protected by trade secrets.

722
0:52:39.240 --> 0:52:44.800
This is not a way of giving away your secrets.

723
0:52:44.800 --> 0:52:46.360
They are protected through courts.

724
0:52:46.360 --> 0:52:48.280
They are systems.

725
0:52:48.280 --> 0:52:56.680
We have years and years of practice in national system, in tribunal, to know exactly what

726
0:52:56.680 --> 0:53:01.280
can be showed, how can it be showed, and what to protect.

727
0:53:01.280 --> 0:53:08.120
But there should be an access to the necessary information for that.

728
0:53:08.120 --> 0:53:16.760
And finally, this is a bit of the small details that have been changed.

729
0:53:16.760 --> 0:53:22.760
There was a ceiling before for claims, before you could not get more than 70 million.

730
0:53:22.760 --> 0:53:26.840
I mean, we're not talking about every claim will be 70 million.

731
0:53:26.840 --> 0:53:28.600
Let's put it like this.

732
0:53:28.600 --> 0:53:30.480
But there was a ceiling cap.

733
0:53:30.480 --> 0:53:32.080
This has been removed.

734
0:53:32.080 --> 0:53:36.640
Nothing explained that you should limit it in number of money.

735
0:53:36.640 --> 0:53:38.240
There was a threshold.

736
0:53:38.240 --> 0:53:44.840
If your damage was less than 500 euros, you could not have any claim for liability.

737
0:53:44.840 --> 0:53:51.640
And then the liability as a time period, you're not liable for 300 years.

738
0:53:51.640 --> 0:53:57.280
You're liable for 10 years after putting on the market your product.

739
0:53:57.280 --> 0:54:01.840
After that, you cannot be held liable under these rules.

740
0:54:01.840 --> 0:54:04.960
But there is a time limitation.

741
0:54:04.960 --> 0:54:13.520
This allows to predict and to ensure the risk of your business, if it's a business, or of

742
0:54:13.520 --> 0:54:15.680
your product.

743
0:54:15.680 --> 0:54:20.440
And there has been a small adaptation for personal injuries.

744
0:54:20.440 --> 0:54:25.080
This is typical for some specific product like pharmaceutical products where the damage

745
0:54:25.080 --> 0:54:27.280
appears after.

746
0:54:27.280 --> 0:54:33.040
I mean, I didn't go into all the details, but the product liability does not apply only

747
0:54:33.040 --> 0:54:34.280
to software.

748
0:54:34.280 --> 0:54:35.840
It's one of the products.

749
0:54:35.840 --> 0:54:42.080
We're talking about cars, cars, pharmaceutical products, all of them.

750
0:54:42.080 --> 0:54:48.480
So any damage that any of those products will cause, you would have a claim for compensation.

751
0:54:48.480 --> 0:54:51.480
So that's it from me.

752
0:54:51.480 --> 0:54:53.000
Thank you very much.

753
0:54:53.000 --> 0:54:58.920
I hope there was not too technical.

754
0:54:58.920 --> 0:55:02.640
Thank you, Omar.

755
0:55:02.640 --> 0:55:05.040
We're going to go now to the panel.

756
0:55:05.040 --> 0:55:10.520
And I will introduce James Lovegrove from Red Hat, our policy director.

757
0:55:10.520 --> 0:55:12.880
Who will be the moderator?

758
0:55:12.880 --> 0:55:19.720
So I'm giving the mic to James.

759
0:55:19.720 --> 0:55:20.720
Very good.

760
0:55:20.720 --> 0:55:22.720
Welcome, everyone.

761
0:55:22.720 --> 0:55:26.040
I appreciate that we're halfway through the session.

762
0:55:26.040 --> 0:55:31.200
So if you want to stand up and then sit down and stretch your arms, that's fine.

763
0:55:31.200 --> 0:55:38.400
So in terms of the first time we came, yesterday we had the policy summit brought together

764
0:55:38.400 --> 0:55:42.800
a couple hundred people in person and hundreds more online, I understand.

765
0:55:42.800 --> 0:55:46.760
But what's interesting is only five, six years ago when we started it in earnest, as the

766
0:55:46.760 --> 0:55:52.240
OFEs in the crowd, there was literally, I see Talo was there, there were sort of 14,

767
0:55:52.240 --> 0:55:53.440
15 people in the room.

768
0:55:53.440 --> 0:55:58.920
So I mean, that massive scaling is interesting in the sense of response to the growth of

769
0:55:58.920 --> 0:56:06.640
EU policy impacting digital ecosystems, open source included, but also the intent and realization

770
0:56:06.640 --> 0:56:12.400
that as a community of open source practitioners, further collaboration and coordination is

771
0:56:12.400 --> 0:56:13.800
absolutely essential.

772
0:56:13.800 --> 0:56:17.880
I think today is a good example where the Commission sees that as well.

773
0:56:17.880 --> 0:56:24.000
We're joined today by three members of the European Commission, from Digit, from Grow,

774
0:56:24.000 --> 0:56:25.000
from Connect.

775
0:56:25.000 --> 0:56:28.800
And frankly, I think they're worth a shout out and a round of applause.

776
0:56:28.800 --> 0:56:30.320
It's a big deal having them here.

777
0:56:30.320 --> 0:56:31.320
Thank you.

778
0:56:31.320 --> 0:56:36.400
All right.

779
0:56:36.400 --> 0:56:41.080
So I mean, music to our ears, Benjamin made it really clear up there, he mentioned rationale

780
0:56:41.080 --> 0:56:44.040
to exclude non-commercial open source.

781
0:56:44.040 --> 0:56:52.640
So the door is open, the ears are open, but this is a complex process.

782
0:56:52.640 --> 0:56:56.520
Yesterday we were talking about the analogy of trains leaving stations and so forth, and

783
0:56:56.520 --> 0:56:58.560
yeah, it's now en route.

784
0:56:58.560 --> 0:57:03.280
That's going through quite a complex co-regulatory process.

785
0:57:03.280 --> 0:57:07.560
And as a community, we don't have the resources in many cases to actually keep up with that.

786
0:57:07.560 --> 0:57:13.880
So again, this kind of collaboration is absolutely critical if we're going to reflect that rationale

787
0:57:13.880 --> 0:57:17.640
of best practices when it comes to open source, but also best practice in terms of the tools

788
0:57:17.640 --> 0:57:20.760
that we're talking about into the law, into the practice.

789
0:57:20.760 --> 0:57:26.920
Otherwise, there will be unintended consequences, and I think nobody wants to hear that.

790
0:57:26.920 --> 0:57:34.040
I think the final point I want to make just before I hand over to our first panelist is

791
0:57:34.040 --> 0:57:40.440
that even if we get the open source exclusion and some of the clarity into the text and

792
0:57:40.440 --> 0:57:46.880
the articles around open source, it's still kind of half of the journey.

793
0:57:46.880 --> 0:57:49.120
And I think that's important just to underscore.

794
0:57:49.120 --> 0:57:55.460
There are still elements which need further discussion, how they practically impact this

795
0:57:55.460 --> 0:57:59.640
extraordinary ecosystem.

796
0:57:59.640 --> 0:58:04.700
And I think without further ado, I'm going to hand over to Zoe, who is the senior policy

797
0:58:04.700 --> 0:58:06.920
manager from Digital Europe.

798
0:58:06.920 --> 0:58:11.840
I'll let her introduce what the organization does and who it represents, but it's a big

799
0:58:11.840 --> 0:58:17.780
deal when it comes to engaging with EU policymakers, both here in Brussels but across the union,

800
0:58:17.780 --> 0:58:22.640
and it's great to have her here to let us know what Digital Europe thinks about this.

801
0:58:22.640 --> 0:58:23.640
Thanks.

802
0:58:23.640 --> 0:58:28.880
Thank you, James.

803
0:58:28.880 --> 0:58:33.760
Thanks a lot, everyone, and indeed, many thanks to the organizers of the panel, but also to

804
0:58:33.760 --> 0:58:35.520
the Commission.

805
0:58:35.520 --> 0:58:39.880
We also do really appreciate that you always take the time, and I know how much effort

806
0:58:39.880 --> 0:58:42.400
you are putting on this legislation.

807
0:58:42.400 --> 0:58:47.360
So Digital Europe is an industry trade association.

808
0:58:47.360 --> 0:58:53.920
For those that don't know, we represent the tech industry that is active in Europe, but

809
0:58:53.920 --> 0:59:00.800
we also obviously represent both global actors from across all regions that they are doing

810
0:59:00.800 --> 0:59:03.280
business in the tech industry in Europe.

811
0:59:03.280 --> 0:59:05.380
And we have two chambers of members.

812
0:59:05.380 --> 0:59:10.440
We have the corporate ones, and we also have the national trade associations.

813
0:59:10.440 --> 0:59:14.600
This gives us an outlook on both the global scale of things, but also on the national

814
0:59:14.600 --> 0:59:15.600
level.

815
0:59:15.600 --> 0:59:23.280
We also represent trade associations, including SMEs, for example.

816
0:59:23.280 --> 0:59:28.240
So why are we here?

817
0:59:28.240 --> 0:59:35.240
That's because we think that the Cyber Resilience Act is one of the most pivotal legislation

818
0:59:35.240 --> 0:59:36.640
that we are going to have.

819
0:59:36.640 --> 0:59:40.120
Well, now we're this funded, but in general, it's a trendsetter.

820
0:59:40.120 --> 0:59:42.320
It's a very, very important legislation.

821
0:59:42.320 --> 0:59:48.920
At Digital Europe, we do sort of internal search to see what is important for our members

822
0:59:48.920 --> 0:59:56.240
to make sure that our resources are allocated accordingly, and AI, data, and the Cyber Resilience

823
0:59:56.240 --> 1:00:01.920
Act have been ranked as the three highest priorities for the digital industry.

824
1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:08.360
So I just want to emphasize again how important this legislation is, and thank again the organizers

825
1:00:08.360 --> 1:00:12.520
for really taking the time to highlight this.

826
1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:17.800
Now I think it's probably one of the first times that the industry and NGOs really agree.

827
1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:24.040
So Martin's presentation was very interesting, and I noted down many of the points that we

828
1:00:24.040 --> 1:00:27.160
also highlight in our position.

829
1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:32.520
I also want to take a moment to say that you probably wonder, especially the open source

830
1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:39.320
community, you wonder why the industry, the big tech or multinationals, why do they care

831
1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.360
about the open source community?

832
1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.460
So actually, I just wanted to clarify that for us, it's very, very important to make

833
1:00:47.460 --> 1:00:52.960
sure that the open source community is not overburdened by this legislation.

834
1:00:52.960 --> 1:01:00.680
For many of our members, even up to 100% of their commercial products have relied on open

835
1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:06.200
source components, and just like James said, there are many priorities, many things that

836
1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:11.080
we can improve at the CRA, but not overburdening the open source community is one of our top

837
1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:12.760
priorities as well.

838
1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:21.120
So it is also important to note that it's a bit of a stereotype to think that the big

839
1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.400
tech companies, for example, they only rely on closed source and they don't care about

840
1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:31.640
the open source community, but I want to highlight that for us, it is very, very high important

841
1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:37.320
to make this a key priority for the CRA to have clarity on what this means for the open

842
1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:38.920
source community.

843
1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:46.400
So I'm not going to repeat too much myself because you already said it, Recital10 excludes

844
1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:49.440
open source, and we very much welcome this.

845
1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:51.640
And in general, we welcome the legislation.

846
1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.080
It's a very good draft.

847
1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:55.640
It's something we can really work with, and we need it.

848
1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:56.640
We can start from that.

849
1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:02.400
We all agree, also the private sector, that we absolutely need these type of requirements.

850
1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:06.720
So we are very willing to find a way together that makes it work, but we really need to

851
1:02:06.720 --> 1:02:08.240
get it right.

852
1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.080
Including too much, too soon, can also be very damaging.

853
1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:19.580
So for open source, there is the conundrum of it's excluded, but not really.

854
1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:25.880
So the text says that it's not in, but then when you look at the commercial element of

855
1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:32.120
it, and if you look at the definition of what commercial is under the blue guide of the

856
1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:37.520
new legislative framework, it says that commercial is understood as providing goods in a business-related

857
1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:38.720
context.

858
1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:42.160
So what does this mean for the open source community?

859
1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:43.920
What does a business context mean?

860
1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:50.120
Because like I said before, many of the commercial products rely on open source components.

861
1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:52.200
So we need clarity.

862
1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:56.400
Right now, if you look at the document, there are 85 pages.

863
1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:59.260
Commercial is mentioned only twice, and there is no definition.

864
1:02:59.260 --> 1:03:05.360
But this brings me to the bigger element, the issue of the proposal that we really see.

865
1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:10.800
One, we really welcome the fact that the NLF is the approach that is chosen.

866
1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:17.160
Benjamin did a great job explaining the NLF and the C marking and everything related tangible

867
1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:18.160
products.

868
1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:26.360
That is now, the big quest right now is how to move a regime that has been so working

869
1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:28.680
very well, we think, for tangible products.

870
1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:33.640
But now, the biggest challenge is the CRA wants to transform this regime into something

871
1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:40.640
that is workable for software, which is, again, very welcome, because NLF has proven to be

872
1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:43.840
the right way to do things.

873
1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:48.760
But we really need to work more on the definitions.

874
1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:52.080
So commercial is just one way, one example.

875
1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:54.760
Then there are other examples, like components.

876
1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:01.680
In Article 11, when it comes to reporting, it says that manufacturers have to also report

877
1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:09.000
on vulnerabilities, including soft open source components in paragraph 7.

878
1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:15.000
So the question there is, what does a component mean in the context of the software as well?

879
1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.760
So this is a general comment on how we really need to work together to transform NLF into

880
1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:22.480
something that makes sense for software.

881
1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:28.840
This is why at Digital Europe, we have been really advocating for a clear provision asking

882
1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:34.720
the Commission to develop guidelines that are specifically, that they adapt to the specificities

883
1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:43.160
of software, and specifically, standalone software, with the inclusion of the industry.

884
1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:47.040
Because what we see here is that the people that are going to actually have to abide by

885
1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:52.520
the new compliance rules, the industry players, are not really included in the draft in the

886
1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:56.600
sense that we really want to be part of an expert group, that we are going to help the

887
1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.900
Commission that we know has the appetite to do this right.

888
1:04:59.900 --> 1:05:03.200
But we bring the experience, and we bring the questions also.

889
1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:04.200
What does this mean?

890
1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:07.200
What does placement of the market for software, for example, mean?

891
1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:09.400
What does substantial modification mean?

892
1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:10.400
Modification, sorry.

893
1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:15.040
So all these things, we, I think the important thing is that we all see the, we have the

894
1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:19.300
appetite, but it still needs to be clarified in the text.

895
1:05:19.300 --> 1:05:24.080
And maybe just as a final point, all these things need time.

896
1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:29.760
And I really welcome the question before on standardization.

897
1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:36.360
We appreciate that 90% of the products rely on self-assessment and when existing harmonized

898
1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:38.560
standards are there.

899
1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:43.240
But we also need to look at what does this 10% mean for critical products?

900
1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:47.880
Have we actually made an assessment of how much of the burden is for third party conformity,

901
1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:51.760
for example, are notified, but is ready?

902
1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:57.080
So this all means that we need time to get it right.

903
1:05:57.080 --> 1:06:04.520
The current proposal says 24 months for implementation for the development of harmonized standards,

904
1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:09.880
sorry, and for the development process is just too little.

905
1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:13.780
And I think this is probably something we are more or less aligned on, that we need

906
1:06:13.780 --> 1:06:15.780
more time.

907
1:06:15.780 --> 1:06:20.520
And for us, the proposal is 48 months, but I know this is something we will discuss further

908
1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.520
with the Commission and with the collaborators.

909
1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:23.520
Okay.

910
1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:25.320
So I don't want to go into more.

911
1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:26.660
There's way more there.

912
1:06:26.660 --> 1:06:33.040
Just as a final comment, even if, as James said, even if we get the open source exclusion

913
1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:39.000
right, there are several things that need to work in the whole context of software,

914
1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000
including reporting obligations.

915
1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:49.120
The right timelines right now, it says 24 hours for initial notification, but we want

916
1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.280
it to be aligned fully with a needs directive because we think it's just introducing too

917
1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.840
many processes, it's just too much.

918
1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:03.360
And yeah, I mean, I don't want to go too much into more details because James is giving

919
1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:06.320
me a smile that says that I've talked too much.

920
1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:08.080
Thank you very much.

921
1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.080
Thank you, Zoe.

922
1:07:09.080 --> 1:07:10.080
Well done.

923
1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:16.880
So I'm going to now turn to Rom, a colleague of mine.

924
1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:23.360
As you know, Red Hat is an upstream first pure play open source software company.

925
1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:28.640
And therefore Rom spends a lot of his time, maybe a lot of, most of his time upstream

926
1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:32.760
as a volunteer, as a developer, as a contributor.

927
1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:36.600
So I'd be interested in hearing your perspective.

928
1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:43.280
As Martin was mentioning, he has a particular perspective on it from DNS and now the sort

929
1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:48.280
of wider, larger ecosystems that are involved in the kinds of products and projects that

930
1:07:48.280 --> 1:07:50.240
Red Hat's involved in.

931
1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:56.720
And to Omar's point earlier about just getting real on zero bugs being impossible in the

932
1:07:56.720 --> 1:08:01.480
context of PLD, I think that's an important point to underscore and something which, you

933
1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:06.640
know, the no known vulnerabilities implications for open source or even for proprietary, not

934
1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:11.720
so much proprietary, but nonetheless, it is important to have that, recognize that the

935
1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:16.000
commission understands that, but it needs reflecting, as I say, in the text to make

936
1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.800
sure that clarity is clear.

937
1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:23.040
So Rom, I'm going to come over to you and give you the microphone.

938
1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:24.040
Thank you.

939
1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:30.920
Yeah, so we are in a unique position at Red Hat of being a large contributor for the open

940
1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:36.200
source and if you look at the portfolio of product that we have, I think we're depending

941
1:08:36.200 --> 1:08:41.560
and contributing to about more than a million different open source projects.

942
1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:46.320
That's the level of contribution.

943
1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:53.160
One particular example that James was mentioning is the look at critical systems, but also

944
1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:59.120
critical products like credentials and the zero bug.

945
1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:04.000
We all know that zero bug policy is impossible to achieve and I'm really glad that Omar

946
1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.480
underlined this.

947
1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:13.000
But the reality is that if we don't have clear definition about this, it's going to slow

948
1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.240
down so much contribution, so much innovation that we have.

949
1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:23.320
We already see that through the lens of our internal folks and myself for some project

950
1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:29.320
that I'm working on from communities, maybe you know communities, with the Special Interest

951
1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:34.760
Group for authentication and key management system.

952
1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:39.640
There's a lot of people scared there.

953
1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:47.720
Because we're looking into putting into, I would say into the product, new features that

954
1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:54.960
we deem interesting and we truly believe that it will be a game changer for the community

955
1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:58.560
and putting a product in production.

956
1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:05.760
But in the meantime, we are really scared because we are not able to make a full interrupt

957
1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:10.840
compatibility assessment with all the different projects.

958
1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:13.280
As I said, one million projects.

959
1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:19.960
Can you imagine if you start having the need to go through the full cycle of integration

960
1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:21.960
and testing for this?

961
1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:25.200
We try to do it at Red Hat.

962
1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.480
And that's sometimes the reason why when you look at the difference between what you find

963
1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:38.880
in the community with Fedora, or doing a bit of marketing now, about Fedora or SenseOS or

964
1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.240
I would say OKD, you will see that there's a major gap between what we have there, which

965
1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:49.720
is like top edge cutting edge solution versus what we have in the product because we have

966
1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:53.760
that we're scared about it.

967
1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:58.760
Not scared in the sense that we don't want to give innovation, but we are scared about

968
1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:03.560
what would be the end goal, the end results if we are becoming responsible also for some

969
1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:06.520
breaches.

970
1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:12.920
With credentials and the work I'm doing on contributing actually because we are about

971
1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:20.360
112% working on this.

972
1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:25.640
We look into this perspective, this lens of compliance and regulation and no later than

973
1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:35.000
yesterday I was in one of our company events where we had 1200 techy people, we were interested

974
1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:41.080
in technology and we were discussing a group of 60 there about this.

975
1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:43.920
And that's the moment some people were like oh I'm not going to touch this, I don't want

976
1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:46.300
to be responsible for this.

977
1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:52.520
So we need more clarity, we need more understanding, so when we see the law and that's what I would

978
1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:59.560
really love to have, it's to have more like a framework where we can share this with the

979
1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:08.960
community and make sure that we can put straight upstream those perspective, those regulation

980
1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:16.640
compliance perspective so that you guys are not afraid of contributing to any top notch

981
1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:19.640
cutting edge solutions.

982
1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:21.220
Credential is one of them.

983
1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:28.080
If you know a bit of communities, you know that it's nothing related to password managers,

984
1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:33.320
but as soon as you're using secrets with communities then it becomes a password manager and it's

985
1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.960
a critical class one product then.

986
1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:44.120
So it's those kind of things that nobody can think about but we need to get that into perspective

987
1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.860
so we understand what needs to happen then in the product.

988
1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:53.880
So there's specific elements to take care and there's a cycle of work that is really,

989
1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:58.640
I was going to say burden but we all know that when we do software we need to go through

990
1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.980
a secure supply chain.

991
1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:07.560
This is the buzzword of 2022 and 2023 but it's a reality and I like to comment about

992
1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:09.460
the ISO part.

993
1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:12.760
There's so many different ways to standardize this.

994
1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.800
There's so many ways, there's the best practices from an industry standpoint.

995
1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:25.540
There's guide, I think the EU has the blue guide also where you can have some guidelines.

996
1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:31.720
So there's different ways to approach this but it's an ethical responsibility to apply

997
1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:39.200
it and sometimes, well, we are so carry on with our innovation that we forget about it.

998
1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:41.700
We're like, oh, we should do it like this.

999
1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:44.040
And so that's the other side.

1000
1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:47.380
I'm really worried about the regulation but in the meantime I'm really happy that there's

1001
1:13:47.380 --> 1:13:54.440
something there to enforce us straight from the beginning to have this secure supply chain

1002
1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:55.440
in perspective.

1003
1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.440
That's for me actually.

1004
1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.880
Great thanks, Rom.

1005
1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:07.580
I think one of the things I took from that is, and I think this penny is dropping not

1006
1:14:07.580 --> 1:14:16.080
just in this room but elsewhere, is that software is fungible and I think some of the terms

1007
1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:26.480
in the draft regulation around intended purpose around calling from my son, probably not a

1008
1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:35.200
good time by Sam, in terms of intended purpose, reasonably foreseeable, any known or foreseeable

1009
1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:41.680
circumstances, I think that's something which gives open source reports for concern.

1010
1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:47.480
And I think one of the reasons is, coming from an open source licensing perspective,

1011
1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:53.280
is that bringing that community together is not just a question of passion to solve problems

1012
1:14:53.280 --> 1:15:00.200
and build out open innovation in Europe but also to be shielded so developers do not incur

1013
1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:03.400
liability nor offer warranties.

1014
1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:07.280
And I think that's something which is clearly important.

1015
1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:13.200
And actually it's a good segue to Ghes because in his capacity at Digit in the open source

1016
1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:23.360
program office, the EUPL is one of such license which again is important to open source contributors

1017
1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:24.360
and collaborators.

1018
1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:33.360
So I'd be interested to hear more from your perspective, and understand from your thoughts

1019
1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:34.960
on this particular topic.

1020
1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.000
Thanks.

1021
1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.080
Thank you, and it's very good to be back at Fosten, people.

1022
1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:42.680
I think we all agree.

1023
1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:47.600
This legislation of course also impacts the Commission open source projects.

1024
1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:54.120
So we're looking forward to figuring out how to work on this.

1025
1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:58.400
To give you a bit of perspective, so I talk on behalf of the European Commission's open

1026
1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:04.280
source program office, and going to quote the words from Deborah Bryant yesterday, where

1027
1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:11.200
basically for you an easy to find, easy to access way to find out who to talk to amongst

1028
1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:12.200
our colleagues.

1029
1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:13.200
We will do the leg work.

1030
1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.480
We'll find out who we should put you in touch with.

1031
1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:19.400
We'll find out who to talk to.

1032
1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:24.400
And we will liaise when necessary between the Commission policymakers and the open source

1033
1:16:24.400 --> 1:16:25.400
community.

1034
1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:30.640
So that's one thing I can promise you, we'll try and make this happen.

1035
1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.600
A little bit about the OSPO, James.

1036
1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:34.120
Is that okay as context?

1037
1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:42.440
So we started in 2020 thanks to a communication from the Commission to itself about an open

1038
1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:48.760
source strategy that recognized that if the Commission wants to reach its political goals,

1039
1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:53.800
it needs to basically take into account that in everything there is software and in all

1040
1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:59.320
the major political goals, open source is a critical component.

1041
1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:05.160
To be an industry, to be a European market, to be active in innovation, to be active in

1042
1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:10.480
competition, open source is there and it can't be taken out.

1043
1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:18.680
One of the first things we did as OSPO is make it super easy for the Commission to disseminate

1044
1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:20.480
its open source process.

1045
1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:24.600
So far, previously it was a paperwork process that would take six months.

1046
1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:30.600
Now it is basically up to the project to decide we want to go open and we have a code repository,

1047
1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:36.160
code.europa.tu, which now has some 200 projects, some 700 users.

1048
1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:42.840
This is from the Commission, from IESMA, from DG Connect, from JRC, from the European Central

1049
1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:44.680
Bank, from the EDPS.

1050
1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.360
So you should check that out and maybe start working on some of these solutions.

1051
1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:52.120
This also shows that we will be impacted because we're pulling in an enormous amount of open

1052
1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:59.200
source to build these components.

1053
1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:03.680
Another thing that I think is good for you to realize is that we're, as a Commission

1054
1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.400
OSPO, in touch with OSPOs in the member states.

1055
1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:08.520
Some of them are here.

1056
1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:13.160
I have my colleagues from Germany on the right for you on the left and the colleagues from

1057
1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:17.360
the Czech Republic on the left for me, so on the right for you.

1058
1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:20.920
And we're in touch with these specifically for this kind of reasons.

1059
1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:26.240
We need to network as OSPOs, we need to avoid making mistakes that others have made before

1060
1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:31.240
us and work as a group.

1061
1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.680
I think I'll stop here.

1062
1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:33.680
It's a good introduction.

1063
1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:34.680
Very good.

1064
1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:35.680
Thanks, Gace.

1065
1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:46.200
So I am conscious we have, if I'm right, another half an hour, 25 minutes.

1066
1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:47.200
Is that right?

1067
1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:50.320
10 till 10.

1068
1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:55.280
So I would like to give Benjamin the floor just to capture some of the thoughts I see

1069
1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.280
you scribbling down.

1070
1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.720
I hope I don't put you on the spot.

1071
1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:02.520
But I'm sure some of them are familiar and it would be really good to hear from you on

1072
1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:03.520
those.

1073
1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:04.520
Thanks.

1074
1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:05.520
Great.

1075
1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:06.520
Thank you so much.

1076
1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:10.680
Yeah, I mean, actually all the points are familiar to me.

1077
1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:14.160
We are, of course, engaging a lot with stakeholders.

1078
1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:19.360
And yeah, so I mean, as the Commission, we are now in a bit in a tricky position because

1079
1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:21.640
we made the proposal.

1080
1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:25.880
And it's, of course, the Commission's view that our own proposal is perfect the way it

1081
1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:27.480
is.

1082
1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:30.880
That being said, it's the beginning of the journey.

1083
1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:35.880
And I mean, it goes without saying that the Parliament and Council were closely looked

1084
1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:39.760
at the text and they're, of course, also consulting us a lot.

1085
1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:44.160
And many of the things that have been mentioned here, they are being discussed by the Co-Legislator.

1086
1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:50.840
So for example, this question of providing products with no known vulnerability.

1087
1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:56.160
I mean, I can say that this is being discussed already by the Co-Legislators.

1088
1:19:56.160 --> 1:20:01.120
And also, I mean, we've heard quite often already this concern that maybe the transition

1089
1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:02.120
period is too short.

1090
1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:05.120
I mean, we believe that 24 months is sufficient.

1091
1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:08.680
But we hear this a lot from other stakeholders.

1092
1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:13.720
So I mean, you can be sure that this is being all taken very seriously from us.

1093
1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:14.720
Wonderful.

1094
1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:26.760
Now, folks, it's really important that this community here in this room take this opportunity.

1095
1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:30.120
It's not a speak now or forever, hold your peace.

1096
1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:31.520
But it is a good opportunity.

1097
1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:40.320
So if there are any who want to chime in a question, comment, that would be great.

1098
1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.120
And then we're going to move back to the panel.

1099
1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:44.000
Who's first?

1100
1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.120
I think you're first.

1101
1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:49.320
I already stole your mic.

1102
1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:50.320
Sorry.

1103
1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:51.320
Okay, go for it.

1104
1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:52.320
Can I borrow one?

1105
1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:53.320
Please.

1106
1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:54.320
Go for it.

1107
1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:55.320
Okay.

1108
1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:56.320
Sorry.

1109
1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:57.320
So I'll try to be brief, but there's a lot to say.

1110
1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:00.080
So first I have to apologize because I feel about this.

1111
1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:01.720
So I will be carried away.

1112
1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:02.720
Sorry.

1113
1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:05.480
Nothing I'm going to say is meant to be offensive to the Commission.

1114
1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:09.040
Actually I think that many of the recent attacks are very good for the internet industry, for

1115
1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:11.320
the internet, like the digital market side.

1116
1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:16.360
So the criticism will not be meant as a rejection of regulation.

1117
1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:23.000
So my perspective, I'm a software developer and the head of policy for OpenExchange, which

1118
1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:27.260
is a German open source software maker of around 270 people.

1119
1:21:27.260 --> 1:21:31.440
So I'd say that we are small compared to the big tech industries globally.

1120
1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:33.080
But we are still one of the biggest.

1121
1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:36.240
So we are also one of the companies that I mean, we make stuff that is in every Linux

1122
1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:38.320
distribution like Davco.

1123
1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:40.480
And so we care about security.

1124
1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.960
We are ISO certified, ISO 27.1.

1125
1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:43.960
We do this.

1126
1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:47.640
So we are among those that could afford to follow everything that's in the CRI and would

1127
1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:49.140
do that.

1128
1:21:49.140 --> 1:21:50.880
But we are part of an ecosystem.

1129
1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:54.920
And so we feel the need to, I mean, also bring the perspective of others, including some

1130
1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:57.840
smaller projects that we use in our own projects.

1131
1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:01.640
And the problem with this regulation is, well, there are multiple problems.

1132
1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:03.920
Let's start from the non-commercial exemption.

1133
1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:09.480
So there isn't really no way that you can tell commercial projects from non-commercial

1134
1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:14.800
projects because each and every project, except maybe like my hobby project, which I only

1135
1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:20.120
do for myself and publish somewhere, has some economic result, creates value.

1136
1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:23.160
And there will be people using it to create further value.

1137
1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:28.920
And so it is basically very hard to write a non-ambiguous way to tell commercial from

1138
1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:30.160
non-commercial.

1139
1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.960
And all projects, including like, I mean, search centers like in the net universities

1140
1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:37.720
need some money to get at least donations.

1141
1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.680
So there is no way you can tell this.

1142
1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:43.920
And on the other hand, I would also be against in saying that all open source software is

1143
1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:47.880
exempt from this regulation because I'm sure that the proprietary software makers would

1144
1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:51.560
come and say, you know, as they have been saying for 20 years, open source is just a

1145
1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:55.600
toy, it's just a hobby project, so you should use proprietary software which is secure.

1146
1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:56.680
So don't do that.

1147
1:22:56.680 --> 1:23:01.520
The problem is really that this law doesn't seem to understand how software works.

1148
1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:05.980
I mean, software, pure software, material products have a nature which is significantly

1149
1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:09.160
different than any physical product with software in it.

1150
1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:13.920
So this regulation seems to be designed with cars in demand, with toys, with IoT devices,

1151
1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:15.760
but not for pure software.

1152
1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:18.280
Pure software is more similar to literature in a way.

1153
1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:22.200
It's something that is the result of collective development.

1154
1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:26.880
And if you have a look at open source projects, yes, we are the manufacturers of Davco.

1155
1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:30.400
But if you look at the code, it's written by people everywhere on the planet.

1156
1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:35.400
So yes, but the real authors are maybe like a thousand people which are in Europe, outside

1157
1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:36.880
of Europe, everywhere.

1158
1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:41.760
And so your law seems to put the burden of putting a CE mark on every line of code which

1159
1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:43.080
is imported into Europe.

1160
1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:44.960
I don't even know what that means.

1161
1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:46.440
We have repositories.

1162
1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:48.360
Maybe they are in Europe, they are mirrored in the US.

1163
1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:52.000
There are people from Australia and from China putting code into it.

1164
1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.640
And this code is traveling all over the world throughout the borders of the European Union

1165
1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:57.760
several times per second.

1166
1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:01.960
So should I every time I check some code, I mean, someone should stop the code at the

1167
1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:03.280
border and put the CE mark.

1168
1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:05.280
This doesn't really make any sense.

1169
1:24:05.280 --> 1:24:07.240
It's simply impossible.

1170
1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:13.240
And it is to say, I mean, all the people here, I mean, your law is designed for the traditional

1171
1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:17.280
20th century way of making things in which there's a manufacturer and there's a distributor

1172
1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:21.440
and someone that sells them in a shop and then there's the use of the consumer.

1173
1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.520
I mean, like if we were still buying, sorry, I'm trying to be sure, but I know you want

1174
1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:28.720
to stop me, but I have to say this.

1175
1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:33.840
And so it seems designed for the time when we went to the shop to media markets and bought

1176
1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:36.600
Windows 95 in a box on a CD.

1177
1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:38.560
And this is not how it works.

1178
1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:44.040
Everyone here is at the same time a manufacturer, a distributor, an importer and a user of code.

1179
1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:46.640
And there's no way you can distinguish these roles.

1180
1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:49.080
So you have to find something.

1181
1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.080
You have to find somewhere.

1182
1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:52.600
So I know I can cut it short.

1183
1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:56.040
So I don't understand the problem you're trying to solve.

1184
1:24:56.040 --> 1:25:00.160
Show me one case in which a European piece of open source software had a problem that,

1185
1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:05.240
I mean, created issues with the entire world and how this could be solved by this regulation.

1186
1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:09.320
Because if you just maybe funded some security audits for projects that cannot afford them,

1187
1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.440
this would make a much bigger effect.

1188
1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.760
So let's start again discussing from software for something specific from software, because

1189
1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:17.160
this really is not working.

1190
1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:18.160
Thank you.

1191
1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:19.160
Thank you.

1192
1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:39.760
So I submitted the open form Europe document that Martin referenced.

1193
1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:42.320
I probably have a dozen questions, but I picked one.

1194
1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:46.640
So to publish software in the EU or to import software into the EU, the publisher must perform

1195
1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.360
CRA certification and accept CRA obligations.

1196
1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:53.760
This means that software from outside the EU will no longer be available in the EU if

1197
1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:58.160
those developers do not perform CRA certification or accept CRA obligations.

1198
1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.840
How is that not a massive problem?

1199
1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:01.840
Yeah.

1200
1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.840
But really, really quick.

1201
1:26:05.840 --> 1:26:06.840
There's always...

1202
1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:07.840
Yeah, okay.

1203
1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:08.840
Yeah.

1204
1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:18.560
I think my understanding is one of the goals of the CRA...

1205
1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:19.560
Close.

1206
1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:20.560
Close.

1207
1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:21.560
Hi.

1208
1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:26.480
I think my understanding is one of the goals of the CRA is to avoid log4j or open SSL type

1209
1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:27.480
of incidents.

1210
1:26:27.480 --> 1:26:30.640
But they are non-commercial open source software.

1211
1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:37.220
And when we exclude them from CRA, we are technically not addressing these cases.

1212
1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:38.680
So what do you think about this?

1213
1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:47.320
As a solution, what do you think about expanding the proposal to set up necessary operational,

1214
1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:54.400
financial assistance dedicated to the critical open source initiatives?

1215
1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:58.480
Maybe especially the EU ones, maybe European OSPO.

1216
1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:04.520
Is that feasible?

1217
1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:05.520
Thank you, Alex.

1218
1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:06.520
Thanks.

1219
1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.960
Thanks for the insights and thanks for the panel.

1220
1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:11.640
I mean, I have two questions.

1221
1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:13.840
We have a lot of problems.

1222
1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:16.280
But I'm interested in solutions.

1223
1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:20.880
So first, what's your proposal to fix this commercial term?

1224
1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.560
So do we have one?

1225
1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:23.560
Could you let us know?

1226
1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:26.080
And the second one, to the Commission.

1227
1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:29.040
So do you see the issue like NLnet?

1228
1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:34.480
So would you consider charities to be affected by this definition or not?

1229
1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:38.120
So what's the Commission take on the NLnet position?

1230
1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:39.120
Thank you.

1231
1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:43.640
Thank you very much.

1232
1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:51.560
And finally, we've known for a long time since David Wheeler wrote his paper stating that

1233
1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:54.560
all open source software is commercial.

1234
1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:59.560
The word commercial is a bad word to use if you want to exclude open source.

1235
1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:05.480
And so I recognize that it arises from the courts in Europe and from the Blue Book.

1236
1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:12.920
But have you considered using different terminology to solve the conflict that exists here because

1237
1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:18.440
of the nature of the community you're addressing rather than because of the context of the

1238
1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:20.960
existing legislation?

1239
1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:28.480
And secondly, which community organizations did you consult in working on both the PLD

1240
1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:30.360
and the CLA?

1241
1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:35.720
The panel is comprised purely of commercial organizations or commission members.

1242
1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:41.360
And all of the questions you've received are from community charity representatives who

1243
1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:43.640
are in the audience and on the panel.

1244
1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:48.120
I wonder what you're going to do to fix this problem so that you don't get it with every

1245
1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:49.680
subsequent bill.

1246
1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:50.680
Thank you.

1247
1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:59.040
Can I?

1248
1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:00.800
Okay.

1249
1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.800
Yeah.

1250
1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:03.800
Thanks a lot for all these questions.

1251
1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:08.320
I mean, maybe first this one on who we consulted.

1252
1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:15.080
So as a run-up to any commission proposal, there is a public consultation which runs

1253
1:29:15.080 --> 1:29:16.160
for three months.

1254
1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:21.880
It's a period of three months where we ask a set of questions to the public and everyone

1255
1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:23.880
can respond to these questions, including you.

1256
1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:25.280
I mean, maybe you didn't know.

1257
1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:26.280
It's possible.

1258
1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:27.280
I understand that.

1259
1:29:27.280 --> 1:29:32.280
Of course, we know, of course, very well that these public consultations, I mean, that big

1260
1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:35.480
players, commercial players, they are more paying attention to this because they have

1261
1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:38.120
the resources to do, though.

1262
1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:39.560
And that's clear to us.

1263
1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:42.040
But that's also, of course, one of the reasons why I'm here, right?

1264
1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:47.240
Because I know that this community, maybe the voice is not heard as much as the voice

1265
1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:52.040
of other communities.

1266
1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:54.440
And as I said, we can, of course, keep engaging.

1267
1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:55.440
You can come later.

1268
1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.920
I can give you a card.

1269
1:29:56.920 --> 1:29:57.920
And we can discuss.

1270
1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:01.880
We can even do maybe another small event and discuss further, right?

1271
1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:05.080
I mean, it's all possible.

1272
1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:09.800
On this concept of commercial, so first, I mean, I think it would be very difficult for

1273
1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:14.360
us to replace it by another concept because it's well grounded in this new legislative

1274
1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:15.920
framework.

1275
1:30:15.920 --> 1:30:21.280
And all the industry players that we've been speaking to so far, they all say they want

1276
1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:26.640
us to use the new legislative framework because they are familiar with it from other product

1277
1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:28.120
types, right?

1278
1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:33.040
So we want to ensure that all stakeholders can use the same framework.

1279
1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:36.400
If we now invent a different framework, it will lead to a lot of fragmentation.

1280
1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:39.640
It will make compliance more difficult for companies.

1281
1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:41.120
So that would be difficult.

1282
1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:45.800
Of course, I mean, there's this crucial question of where to draw the line of commercial.

1283
1:30:45.800 --> 1:30:48.280
I think we are open to all your points.

1284
1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:49.520
We understand them.

1285
1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:55.240
I think what would, from our perspective, be very difficult, I mean, this is how I understood

1286
1:30:55.240 --> 1:31:00.320
your intervention, would be to say we just exclude all open source because it's all somewhat

1287
1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:02.560
commercial and it all needs to be excluded.

1288
1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:06.560
I think this would not work simply for the fact because it would create an incentive

1289
1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:11.200
for proprietary manufacturers to switch over to open source, right?

1290
1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:13.960
Not everyone can do that.

1291
1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:14.960
You want that?

1292
1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:15.960
Okay.

1293
1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:16.960
Okay.

1294
1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:17.960
I see.

1295
1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:21.720
No, but it would create an incentive to get out of the scope and to not have to comply,

1296
1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:22.720
right?

1297
1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:24.600
I don't think this is what you want.

1298
1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:29.280
Then there was also a point from you on all the many small players and how it would be

1299
1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:32.400
maybe difficult for them to comply.

1300
1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:36.620
So the cyber resilience act is, I mean, the requirements are risk-based.

1301
1:31:36.620 --> 1:31:40.080
That means that, I mean, when you're a very small player, there's also a chance that maybe

1302
1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:44.920
your project faces smaller risks and is maybe less critical.

1303
1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:50.640
And you can take that into account when you comply with the requirements of the regulation.

1304
1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:57.440
On top of that, for the vast majority of products, we only require self-attestation by the manufacturers,

1305
1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:02.400
which means you will not have to reach out to any third parties or interact with any

1306
1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:03.400
authorities.

1307
1:32:03.400 --> 1:32:05.640
You can do it all by yourself.

1308
1:32:05.640 --> 1:32:08.520
And this should be absolutely feasible.

1309
1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:10.160
What other questions did we have?

1310
1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:17.320
Yeah, there was this question of how the CRA would improve the ecosystem for components

1311
1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:21.480
that are vulnerable, such as log4j, where you said, I mean, this is a non-commercial

1312
1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:22.480
component.

1313
1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:26.560
So, I mean, we have this due diligence obligation in our proposal.

1314
1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:32.280
That means that in the future, when a commercial manufacturer integrates a product, for instance,

1315
1:32:32.280 --> 1:32:37.640
a logging utility that is free of charge available, they will have to make bigger effort than

1316
1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:40.240
today looking at these components.

1317
1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:42.320
I mean, that, again, of course, depends on the risk.

1318
1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:47.600
I mean, if your project is low risk, you will only maybe check the change log if there are

1319
1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:51.280
regular security updates or not, and you're done with this assessment.

1320
1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:55.800
But of course, if you integrate this component into something much more critical, you will

1321
1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:59.720
have to take a much more closer look at these components.

1322
1:32:59.720 --> 1:33:04.400
So what we're trying to do is we're trying to make manufacturers of commercial products

1323
1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:10.440
proprietary or open source or whatever assume more responsibility for the open source components

1324
1:33:10.440 --> 1:33:11.440
that they're integrating.

1325
1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:17.360
And we believe that this will help raise the level of security on these components as well.

1326
1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:24.260
Yeah, there was this question on whether charities would be considered as a commercial activity.

1327
1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:26.700
So I cannot just give you a straight answer on that.

1328
1:33:26.700 --> 1:33:29.520
I think it always depends on the individual case, right?

1329
1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:35.600
I mean, what we've learned is that there are so many different types of open source projects,

1330
1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:38.240
so many different types of funding models.

1331
1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.360
So you really need to look at each and every case to see if it's a commercial activity

1332
1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:43.360
or not.

1333
1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:47.680
What I already said, I mean, as the commission, we are absolutely willing to provide more

1334
1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:49.160
clarity.

1335
1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:53.240
This could be done, for instance, already in the legislative process that we single

1336
1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:57.360
out important examples and we provide clarity directly in the legal text.

1337
1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:00.800
But for all these other niche cases that will come up, this will not be possible in the

1338
1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:04.520
text because we cannot, you know, a legal text needs to be short and concise and we

1339
1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:07.320
cannot take into account every single example.

1340
1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:15.320
But we're absolutely prepared to provide examples once it has come into force so that you have

1341
1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:19.680
the certainty that you need to know whether you are in the scope or not with your project.

1342
1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:22.280
I think I took them all.

1343
1:34:22.280 --> 1:34:26.880
I think, yeah, of course.

1344
1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:34.920
So for, I mean, I'm going to speak for the PLD, but for my proposal, we had expert groups

1345
1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:44.280
consultation in 2019, 18, 20, 21, consultation also through the contractor where they were

1346
1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:48.280
questioned through different kind of stakeholders.

1347
1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:52.960
We had the consultation for when the proposal was adopted by the commission in September

1348
1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:56.600
2022 with the half-year C-POTO.

1349
1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:03.720
This is where you find all the proposals and where you can give your comments on it.

1350
1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:07.120
And it was for more than three months for ours.

1351
1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:13.280
So we always tried, obviously, to reach as much as possible.

1352
1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:15.840
The thing is, obviously, there are sometimes channels.

1353
1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.880
It's not that we avoid having talks with the people that can criticise the legislation.

1354
1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:23.560
We need critics to also make the legislation better.

1355
1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:25.640
This is how it works.

1356
1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:33.080
So obviously, as you said, that, yeah, there might be some players that are more voiceable.

1357
1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:35.360
This is the reality.

1358
1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:41.560
I think it's also part of how the field or the ecosystem organised between itself.

1359
1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:47.280
You need to have one speaker, someone that can represent also the community, because

1360
1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:52.400
obviously if we have someone that comes for the open source community that says that he's

1361
1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:56.560
speaking for the community, then he would bind everyone.

1362
1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:02.600
So you know, those companies that have those trade associations, et cetera, this also gives

1363
1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:08.040
a framework for us to really say, okay, this is a voice of this sector, this sector, this

1364
1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:09.040
sector.

1365
1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.360
If we do not have this, it's a bit complicated for us to take it as just being the voice

1366
1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:19.040
of the entire community, because you can have an opinion and someone else can have another

1367
1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:23.560
one, but then which one do I have to consider as being the one of this community?

1368
1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:28.040
That's a bit of the complexity also for us, just to be honest.

1369
1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:33.120
On the charity one, there are definitions.

1370
1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.200
Commercial activity is whatever against for money or for free.

1371
1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:42.120
It does not matter the economic value in that sense.

1372
1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:46.280
It's a concept that goes much more broader than this.

1373
1:36:46.280 --> 1:36:51.640
So I understand that there is this need of clarification.

1374
1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:56.240
This is where the definitions are there.

1375
1:36:56.240 --> 1:37:01.800
But they are also the basics of any legislation that we have in the union.

1376
1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:10.040
It's not that simple to change just one definition that is common to all of them in one single

1377
1:37:10.040 --> 1:37:11.040
piece of legislation.

1378
1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.920
This is also the reality of how the proposal works.

1379
1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:17.800
You need coherence.

1380
1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:20.200
You can have some exclusions.

1381
1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:27.240
But we talk about why, I mean, it's not just the need of excluding open source software.

1382
1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:32.080
It's also the need of ensuring that it does not have an impact on innovation, but you

1383
1:37:32.080 --> 1:37:34.840
also need to take into account the reality of it.

1384
1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:37.840
So that's a bit of the...

1385
1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:38.840
Thanks, Omar.

1386
1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:39.840
Benjamin?

1387
1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:40.840
Yeah, sorry.

1388
1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:41.840
I just want to be thorough.

1389
1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:43.760
I forgot to answer one of the questions I just realised.

1390
1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:50.280
So there was a question on whether we think we... whether there could be a risk that products

1391
1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:54.300
developed in third countries would simply not be made available anymore on the European

1392
1:37:54.300 --> 1:37:56.300
Union market.

1393
1:37:56.300 --> 1:37:58.080
So no, we don't see this risk, to be honest.

1394
1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:02.640
I mean, the European Union, depending on the figures that you look at, is probably the

1395
1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:04.400
biggest economy in the world.

1396
1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:09.360
I think everyone has a very strong interest in bringing their products on our market.

1397
1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:11.520
It has also not been the case with other regulation.

1398
1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:16.800
If you think of the GDPR, yeah, I mean, the list of companies that choose not to provide

1399
1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:20.320
services in the European Union because of GDPR is very short, yeah.

1400
1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:22.400
So we don't see this risk.

1401
1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:24.240
Thanks, Benjamin.

1402
1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:30.120
I know, Martin, you're dying to say something.

1403
1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:32.160
So Hannah, go to you.

1404
1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:34.000
Thank you, James.

1405
1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.760
So I will answer the question for Alexander of how to fix this.

1406
1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:42.100
But first, I would like to respond to some of the comments made.

1407
1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:50.760
So I think you hit the nail on the head by saying that the consultation, that it's complex

1408
1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:55.880
within the existing way of how Brussels operate, at least that's my perspective now as a newcomer

1409
1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:57.380
here.

1410
1:38:57.380 --> 1:39:02.760
And I think if we are not addressing that bit, like how to talk to communities like

1411
1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:07.980
this, then we will be in this situation again and again and again and again.

1412
1:39:07.980 --> 1:39:13.120
And I want to point out specifically that the discussion about commercial just now,

1413
1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:19.280
I've read both your proposals, and you are not using the same examples of what constitutes

1414
1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:20.880
a commercial activity.

1415
1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:31.540
So if you're saying that they originated from the legal jurisprudence, then one of you seems

1416
1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:36.280
to have a different view on the jurisprudence than the other one.

1417
1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:46.840
And I was wondering, have you considered talking to the open source program office when considering

1418
1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:47.840
the definition?

1419
1:39:47.840 --> 1:39:52.760
And I'm sorry if this is a bit confrontational, but I was just actually curious.

1420
1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:58.080
So before you answer, I'm going to try to answer Alex Alexander's question.

1421
1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.000
I think he was asking how to fix this.

1422
1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:06.500
I'm not jealous of your jobs because I think this is extremely complicated and I don't

1423
1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:07.800
have the full answers.

1424
1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:11.440
I have one sub-answer and it relates to critical products.

1425
1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:18.360
I believe that there should be an escape hatch for class one and class two critical products

1426
1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:25.880
that if they are completely open source, then there should be the ability to do self-assessment

1427
1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:32.120
regardless of any other factors.

1428
1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:37.960
Because I think the value of having critical products that are open source is tremendous

1429
1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:39.800
in terms of security too.

1430
1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:46.000
So we should be considering that aspect in addition to whether or not there is an EU

1431
1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.080
standard that it can conform to, for example.

1432
1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:57.720
I hope I touched somewhat on the ask again in maybe a couple of weeks because I think

1433
1:40:57.720 --> 1:41:00.760
they are in a hurry, so we should be too.

1434
1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:08.200
And then maybe back to the question I just asked about talking to Gheis.

1435
1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:09.880
The power of the moderator.

1436
1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:10.880
What's it worth?

1437
1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:11.880
Cold beer?

1438
1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:18.040
Maybe just to add one question to make your debate a little harder.

1439
1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:22.560
First I think that we also need to recognize that you guys are also here on a Saturday

1440
1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:29.040
and everything, so I think the appetite to interact with many groups is also there.

1441
1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:31.720
So I think that's important to acknowledge as well.

1442
1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:37.040
But I'm mostly wondering about the part on technical support because we are focusing

1443
1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:44.240
a lot on the definition of commercial, but the text itself says also especially when

1444
1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:52.040
technical support is provided, then the open source software is not excluded anymore.

1445
1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:56.520
And I guess this is more of a general question because I'm not myself an open source developer,

1446
1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:02.440
but I'm just wondering to what extent this is demotivating then for developers because

1447
1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:07.400
I understand a big part of the maintenance after, for example, is a motivating factor

1448
1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:11.800
for people to develop because then they are also involved later on on the maintenance.

1449
1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:16.680
And I'm wondering also to what extent this is counterproductive for the objectives that

1450
1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:22.200
the CRA sets, having the people that are involved in the development but also they're involved

1451
1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:27.520
in the later stages of making sure that the product remains secure, then actually this

1452
1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:31.840
I think I would assume that it helps the security of the product.

1453
1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:36.600
So it's more of a question on whether you have discussed this part.

1454
1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:41.240
I'm sure you have if you put it there, but just if you could elaborate a bit further

1455
1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.320
and an open question also to the audience just because I think it's important for the

1456
1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:48.280
audience to sort of educate us as well.

1457
1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:49.280
Thank you.

1458
1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:50.280
Yes.

1459
1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:51.280
Okay.

1460
1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:53.720
We've got five minutes left.

1461
1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:57.480
So Roman, Omar, and then we close.

1462
1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:00.560
So I'm just going to continue what you just said.

1463
1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:06.000
I think one of the tremendous beauty of the open source community is giving support to

1464
1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:07.920
each other.

1465
1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:12.080
And I think technical support, as defined, is very dangerous.

1466
1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:13.820
And I'm going to give an example.

1467
1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:21.360
If you are having a if you maintain a project and you use one of these service like GitHub

1468
1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:26.500
and you start helping someone to make the solution work.

1469
1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:28.800
So it's technical support, right?

1470
1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:32.080
So you open an issue, you start helping the person and so on.

1471
1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:41.320
If the person who received the help decide to sponsor somehow the developers giving money,

1472
1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:46.400
giving contributions in terms of money, then from the definition it becomes a commercial

1473
1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:47.860
activity.

1474
1:43:47.860 --> 1:43:49.480
This is not the intent.

1475
1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:50.860
It's a donation.

1476
1:43:50.860 --> 1:43:54.360
So I think it's really important to get that into perspective.

1477
1:43:54.360 --> 1:44:03.080
So we are not reducing the level of contribution both in terms of software development, documentation,

1478
1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:08.640
but also money to run some testing infrastructure that is required to do security.

1479
1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:09.640
So that's my point.

1480
1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:10.640
Just it.

1481
1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:11.640
Wonderful.

1482
1:44:11.640 --> 1:44:13.640
There's an applause.

1483
1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:15.640
There we are.

1484
1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:16.640
Good.

1485
1:44:16.640 --> 1:44:18.200
So Omar, I'm going to hand it to you.

1486
1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:24.240
I know you wanted to answer a point from Martin.

1487
1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:32.520
So for the internal cuisine of how the Commission works, proposal don't come out from one own

1488
1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:34.360
service.

1489
1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:38.080
So we have three different director generals.

1490
1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:40.440
So connect for the telecommunication.

1491
1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:45.400
Digi-Grow is for the industry and the JIT.

1492
1:44:45.400 --> 1:44:52.480
Each proposal before going out is assessed by all the dedicated services of the Commission.

1493
1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:57.880
So everyone is consulted and everyone makes the legislation readapted where it needed

1494
1:44:57.880 --> 1:45:03.720
because obviously the expertise of each one of the director generals helps to make the

1495
1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:04.920
proposal.

1496
1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:10.920
So you need – it's an internal mandatory step.

1497
1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:15.440
And on the small definition, it's not that we have different concepts.

1498
1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:22.560
It's the – how it has been interpreted until now and we're talking about almost 40 years

1499
1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:24.560
of case law.

1500
1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:28.520
It's elements of what the commercial activity can be and cannot be.

1501
1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:30.040
It's never a proper situation.

1502
1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:32.560
It does never draw a specific line.

1503
1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:37.400
I know it does not reply to your question, but we have elements of what is or what is

1504
1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:42.820
not a commercial activity and all of them take into account at the end to create the

1505
1:45:42.820 --> 1:45:43.980
commercial activity.

1506
1:45:43.980 --> 1:45:49.160
But they are not – it's not just if you are in room A, it's commercial activity and

1507
1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:51.160
in room B, it's a commercial activity.

1508
1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:54.760
It's different element that can constitute the commercial activity or not.

1509
1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:56.280
That's a bit of a situation.

1510
1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:02.680
If you are developing your open source software from your couch on a Sunday, this is not covered.

1511
1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:09.920
If you're – if a big company takes it out from a website, whatever, you are not making

1512
1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:13.960
the commercial activity, but the company is doing the commercial activity.

1513
1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:18.040
So you're not – you know, these are a bit of the differences.

1514
1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:19.040
These are the elements.

1515
1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:25.080
But if you make it – if you make yourself money out of it, this is a commercial activity

1516
1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:26.800
in a way or another.

1517
1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:29.740
If you also make it, you are the commercial activity.

1518
1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:36.400
If a big company takes the software and puts it in its product, he's doing the commercial

1519
1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.360
activity but not you.

1520
1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:41.320
So you will be the one to cover it, not yourself.

1521
1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:45.720
It's a bit of – this is how the commercial activity works.

1522
1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:48.200
I know it's complex, but yeah.

1523
1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:52.160
I don't know.

1524
1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:54.760
We have two minutes left, so 60 seconds.

1525
1:46:54.760 --> 1:47:01.600
Yeah, I mean, on this technical support, I mean, it's of course a tricky one, right?

1526
1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:06.440
The idea behind the Commission Proposal of the Site Resilience Act is to say that when

1527
1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:10.280
you're making money with a product, it's a commercial activity and then you should

1528
1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:14.600
comply with the rules because there are so many different ways in which you can monetize

1529
1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:15.600
a project.

1530
1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.600
It's not always just charging a price, yeah.

1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:23.400
It could also be placing ads in your mobile app or, I mean, charging a lot of money for

1532
1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:24.400
technical support.

1533
1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:29.660
I mean, technical support does not necessarily mean that it's a non-commercial activity.

1534
1:47:29.660 --> 1:47:32.800
So of course it's different if you just recover your costs, yeah.

1535
1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:34.440
That's maybe something else.

1536
1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:40.160
But if you're truly making money with a project, we are convinced that it's only fair

1540
1:47:53.360 --> 1:48:00.720
We could have gone into the whole notion of components, which you mentioned on 11.7, and

1541
1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:04.400
where we see that posing some workability issues.

1542
1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.240
Unfortunately, we've run out of time.

1543
1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:10.080
But I would like to ask you all to show your...
