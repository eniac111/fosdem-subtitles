00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hello, Fostum.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.720
Wow, it's so good to be here.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.840
You are the heroes of Fostum because I am the closing act and you have come to see me.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.840
This is so good.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.000
Thank you very much for being here.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Six o'clock.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.240
Let's get the show on the road.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.800
I am from the Linux Foundation and I have the privilege of doing research on the open

00:28.800 --> 00:31.680
source ecosystem.

00:31.680 --> 00:38.040
I was brought in a couple of years ago to use data as a means to describe what is taking

00:38.040 --> 00:45.200
place across open source communities and to provide greater insight for the purposes of

00:45.200 --> 00:48.160
supporting all kinds of programs in the ecosystem.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.080
If you were here for Abigail's talk previously, a lot of what she had to say was to do with

00:53.080 --> 00:55.760
sustainability and funding projects.

00:55.760 --> 01:01.160
I am hopeful that the resource that we are creating at the Linux Foundation is the utility

01:01.160 --> 01:06.480
that will help support grants and funding for otherwise non-commercial open source projects,

01:06.480 --> 01:10.800
especially those that are contributing to sustainability.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.480
So that's the perspective that I come from.

01:13.480 --> 01:18.000
We want to investigate the impact of open source projects through research.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.400
We conduct our research through quantitative and qualitative methodologies, surveys, interviews,

01:24.400 --> 01:27.960
and empirical research.

01:27.960 --> 01:34.040
We create this resource, co-create it with the community, we create it by the community,

01:34.040 --> 01:35.800
and we give it back to the community.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.040
The reports are all published under Creative Commons.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.520
You don't have to give your email.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.240
We're not going to spam you for reading them.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.880
So they're a resource for everybody to leverage.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.640
So check us out.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.640
This is our homepage.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.960
We're going to scan and discover the publications that we produce today.

01:54.960 --> 01:59.560
We have 26 publications in just shy of two years on a whole variety of topics that I'll

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
get into.

02:00.560 --> 02:07.040
And the Linux Foundation has a history of doing some important research in open source.

02:07.040 --> 02:13.560
Not that long ago, they published the Linux kernel report, the Linux kernel history report,

02:13.560 --> 02:19.200
as well as the 2020 FOSS contributor survey in collaboration with Harvard's Laboratory

02:19.200 --> 02:26.040
of Innovation Science, which was a deep dive into understanding contributor motivations,

02:26.040 --> 02:27.040
opportunities and challenges.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.600
So if you haven't seen either of those reports, I'd encourage you to check them out.

02:30.600 --> 02:39.080
The 26 reports we've done today are across a number of different frameworks.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.880
It's really tough to package up open source conceptually and do a bunch of research to

02:43.880 --> 02:45.400
say how are we going to organize this.

02:45.400 --> 02:52.640
So we set about, actually, before I get down that path, a quick example of some recent

02:52.640 --> 02:56.840
reports that you'll find at the top of our website include mentorship and open source,

02:56.840 --> 03:03.040
which also plays into Abigail's speech about sustainability and the role of mentorship

03:03.040 --> 03:09.960
programs, enabling collaboration across open source communities all around the world.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.280
How do we enhance collaboration?

03:11.280 --> 03:12.800
How do we break down silos?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.560
And how do we reduce fragmentation?

03:14.560 --> 03:20.680
Industry reports like the 2022 state of open source in financial services takes a deep

03:20.680 --> 03:23.040
dive in an industry sector.

03:23.040 --> 03:31.080
And for our friends at the SOTA Foundation, hello, Stephen Tan, the 2022 data and storage

03:31.080 --> 03:32.240
trends report.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.960
So just a quick highlight of four recent publications that have come out.

03:36.960 --> 03:43.240
We've got great stuff coming down the pike as well, looking at the idea of open source

03:43.240 --> 03:44.520
for digital wallets.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.120
Why do we need an open source digital wallet infrastructure?

03:47.120 --> 03:51.040
Well essentially we have centralization in the wallet community right now through Google

03:51.040 --> 03:53.040
Pay and Apple Pay.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.560
We're creating infrastructure through an open source foundation that's going to create opportunities

03:57.560 --> 04:05.320
for any organization to build a secure digital asset infrastructure.

04:05.320 --> 04:12.360
Web 3 and sustainability, looking at some of the challenges around blockchain and how

04:12.360 --> 04:17.640
we can reduce the environmental and carbon impact of blockchain and how blockchains can

04:17.640 --> 04:23.960
reduce our own through providing secure data sets and perhaps incentives, real monetary

04:23.960 --> 04:29.480
tokens for us to change our behavior and start making sustainable choices and be rewarded

04:29.480 --> 04:31.000
for them.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.360
Be rewarded for buying the carbon neutral product and use the token to ride public transit.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.320
But you can't use the token to put gas in your car.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.160
That's an example of the economies that are coming down the road.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.360
And our deliverables.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.440
Everything we do is available under Creative Commons.

04:50.440 --> 04:56.240
We publish our data sets, our survey data that is free of personally identifiable information.

04:56.240 --> 05:03.640
And we do so on data.world, data repository essentially, not on like GitHub, but a little

05:03.640 --> 05:09.900
bit more accessible for the non-coder to be able to find our data sets.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.400
And if you want to play around with our data and create your own analysis, go to data.world,

05:14.400 --> 05:20.080
check out the Linux foundation data sets and feel free to explore some of our survey data

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
and see what you come up with.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Let us know.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.320
If you find something different, we'd love to hear from you.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.960
We produce reports, infographics and so on.

05:27.960 --> 05:33.900
So check out these resources and if there's a way that you can use them to support your

05:33.900 --> 05:35.800
project communities, go for it.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.600
And let us know how you make out.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.640
So the first way we conduct research is on geographic lines.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.160
We think that there's some unique trends taking place in different regions around the world.

05:47.160 --> 05:52.460
And what's happening in Europe that might be different from North America?

05:52.460 --> 05:53.480
Is there different culture?

05:53.480 --> 05:56.600
Are there different opportunities?

05:56.600 --> 05:57.600
And what's going on?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.320
The first report we published was last year, our Europe spotlight.

06:00.320 --> 06:06.480
So if you're interested in how European open source communities are taking advantage of

06:06.480 --> 06:11.200
the open source opportunity or not, give this report a read.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.700
It's got some pretty interesting insights.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.780
Second way we go about conducting research is long industry analysis.

06:16.780 --> 06:21.680
So if your project is specific to a certain industry, whether it's maybe it's film and

06:21.680 --> 06:28.520
entertainment, maybe it's financial services, maybe it's energy, our research is very focused

06:28.520 --> 06:31.760
sometimes on industry specific open source projects.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.240
The energy example is really exciting.

06:34.240 --> 06:40.640
And the more that regulators know about open source projects in an energy vertical, the

06:40.640 --> 06:44.780
better, because we need to transition off of older infrastructure.

06:44.780 --> 06:48.040
And open source is the path to doing that.

06:48.040 --> 06:53.120
One example of an industry project is in motion pictures industry with the Academy Software

06:53.120 --> 06:54.920
Foundation.

06:54.920 --> 07:02.800
Many of the projects that were used to create the Academy nine time nominated film Dune

07:02.800 --> 07:05.120
is built with open source software.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.320
And we host nine projects at the Academy Software Foundation.

07:09.320 --> 07:14.280
And this research report tells the story of how it was formed and what needs to happen

07:14.280 --> 07:19.520
in that community to keep it sustainable where the challenges are.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.680
Technology horizontal is another way we approach our research.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.440
Recent example being resiliency in cloud.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.280
How do we achieve multi cloud resiliency?

07:30.280 --> 07:34.680
We did this with cloud data computing foundation and it was a result of a round table we hosted

07:34.680 --> 07:37.520
at KubeCon in Valencia.

07:37.520 --> 07:41.280
And finally, and this is where the developer community comes into play, you'll see at the

07:41.280 --> 07:51.360
top of this graphic is the developer contributor framework to view open source opportunities.

07:51.360 --> 07:56.720
What are the issues specific to developers, to maintainers, to sustainability, to diversity

07:56.720 --> 08:03.120
equity inclusion, leadership, racial and social justice, and so on.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.040
So we've got a lot of reports that don't fall neatly into a tech horizontal or an industry

08:08.040 --> 08:15.400
vertical or a geographic framework, but they apply the whole ecosystem.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.040
Recent example DEI.

08:17.040 --> 08:22.160
I happen to coauthor this one with a woman named Jessica Groupman.

08:22.160 --> 08:27.640
And it really talks about the good, the bad and the ugly about diversity issues across

08:27.640 --> 08:31.880
open source project communities and how we can collectively work together to address

08:31.880 --> 08:34.320
some of the challenges.

08:34.320 --> 08:39.000
But importantly we've got more and more work coming that is focused on the developer and

08:39.000 --> 08:40.760
maintainer experience.

08:40.760 --> 08:48.520
And it is very, very important that we continue to explore the issues so that we can provide

08:48.520 --> 08:53.640
better programming and resourcing to support our developer community.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.360
How do we ensure sustainable projects?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.560
How do we ensure diverse projects?

08:57.560 --> 08:59.740
How do we ensure funding?

08:59.740 --> 09:04.080
How do we incentivize developers to implement security best practices?

09:04.080 --> 09:08.920
And we find the answers to these questions through research.

09:08.920 --> 09:15.440
And today I'm going to share some of the insights that have come across the 26 projects that

09:15.440 --> 09:21.080
we've done to date in all different ways that have some story to tell about the developer

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
experience.

09:22.080 --> 09:27.880
So this is what this collection of next slides is all about.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.720
Devs are having a really good time doing what they're doing.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.320
Many projects that we've done have said that open source development is fun.

09:37.320 --> 09:43.400
And like time and time and time again, this is almost a universal truth that people are

09:43.400 --> 09:48.960
here because they find it a stimulating and rewarding place to be.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.760
And that's kind of exciting.

09:51.760 --> 09:52.760
It's great.

09:52.760 --> 09:57.000
And it's probably why open source projects are so prolific.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.440
People enjoy contributing code.

10:00.440 --> 10:07.080
Out of our Europe study, fun really is a leading motivation here, much more so than, say, career

10:07.080 --> 10:09.240
development.

10:09.240 --> 10:16.160
We concluded that, and also through interviews, that there's sort of a romantic thing going

10:16.160 --> 10:20.020
on in Europe that is less prevalent in other geographic regions.

10:20.020 --> 10:28.640
And it really is around doing good, creating solutions that have a purpose.

10:28.640 --> 10:36.560
And there's a strong motivation for learning and fun in this community.

10:36.560 --> 10:43.080
Open source is also an incredibly empowering space for our respondents, the majority of

10:43.080 --> 10:50.800
whom are developers, that the opportunity to create infrastructure, to create projects

10:50.800 --> 11:00.600
that have intrinsic value for a region that allow for sovereignty, that allow us to not

11:00.600 --> 11:04.640
be reliant on certain vendors.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.680
And this is a really motivating factor.

11:07.680 --> 11:14.200
And being in this space is an incredibly empowering and rewarding activity.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.940
We have an opportunity to change the world if we don't like it.

11:18.940 --> 11:24.040
What's fascinating is the extent to which developers are taking a personal interest

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
in their work.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.240
They show up because they care.

11:27.240 --> 11:33.200
And really, without that personal attachment and intrinsic motivation, we just wouldn't

11:33.200 --> 11:37.400
be where we are, especially when we consider how many projects do not have funding.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.840
And they are not part of a commercial ecosystem.

11:40.840 --> 11:46.960
So this motivation keeps these projects going.

11:46.960 --> 11:53.200
The other side of this coin is that if there's a loss of motivation of some kind, if there's

11:53.200 --> 11:57.240
the feeling of sudden apathy, then a project can just be shelved and somebody can sign

11:57.240 --> 11:59.200
off and say, I'm out.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.920
So that is a risk that we face.

12:00.920 --> 12:06.760
And we've seen examples of that recently, though I couldn't name the specific project.

12:06.760 --> 12:11.760
You hear about people having a change of heart.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.160
Training is also something that's incredibly important.

12:14.160 --> 12:22.980
As new technologies are emerging, as security is becoming increasingly important, organizations

12:22.980 --> 12:28.700
are looking for highly skilled, highly trained, open source software developers.

12:28.700 --> 12:35.160
And the skills that they're looking for now have eclipsed Linux as a focus point.

12:35.160 --> 12:41.820
Skills are sought after in cloud, in DevOps, in security, and yes, very much so in Linux.

12:41.820 --> 12:50.680
But we're also seeing new projects emerging in Metaverse, in AI, PyTorch being an example.

12:50.680 --> 12:59.160
So training is very much in demand, and fortunately there are good resources available that are

12:59.160 --> 13:00.400
often free.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.640
We host many of them at the Linux Foundation, so check them out.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.320
The other bit of good news is that employers, if you're fortunate enough to be in a situation

13:08.320 --> 13:13.440
where you're paid to contribute, companies are paying for training.

13:13.440 --> 13:19.840
90% of hiring managers will say, we'll hire you, come here, and we will pay to skill you

13:19.840 --> 13:21.360
up.

13:21.360 --> 13:29.120
And the reason being, not only the hiring managers, but within organizations, we can't

13:29.120 --> 13:33.080
necessarily hire our way out of digital challenges.

13:33.080 --> 13:38.880
We have to sometimes work with the talent pools that we have and train our team members.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.760
Because it's incredibly costly to go out and pay a developer who you think has the right

13:42.760 --> 13:46.280
skills only for them to leave and go to a competitor.

13:46.280 --> 13:54.880
So training a resource in-house seems to be a trend that we're seeing specific to devs.

13:54.880 --> 13:59.840
And fortunately everyone in this room is in a really good position because the demand

13:59.840 --> 14:09.280
for your skills exceeds the supply of skilled people available to provide the service.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.960
You're in a very, very good space right now.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.360
Because industries are becoming increasingly software defined, you are calling all the

14:16.360 --> 14:17.840
shots.

14:17.840 --> 14:22.740
So leverage it to your advantage.

14:22.740 --> 14:26.040
Sometimes there are barriers that prevent you from doing the things that you really

14:26.040 --> 14:27.040
want to do.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.040
I'll give you an example.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.040
You work in an industry full-time.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.080
You have a paid job.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.800
It's in a highly regulated industry, like financial services.

14:34.800 --> 14:43.040
And the company policy says that, sorry, not only can you not contribute to projects on

14:43.040 --> 14:49.800
behalf of the organization and open source that might be beneficial, but you also can't

14:49.800 --> 14:53.840
contribute to projects in your personal time.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.940
And that's a barrier that industry needs to figure out how to solve.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.820
Because it is ultimately to their detriment.

15:00.820 --> 15:05.560
And the regulatory community, particularly in certain verticals, has to come to terms

15:05.560 --> 15:11.120
with the realities of the way open source is developed and not put up so many barriers

15:11.120 --> 15:14.400
that are non-threatening.

15:14.400 --> 15:20.400
I'm thinking of community chat rooms on a repo within financial services and the SEC

15:20.400 --> 15:28.300
freaking out in case regulatory policies were being breached in any kind of activity.

15:28.300 --> 15:36.800
The other barriers for certain types of industries are around access to Slack or access, even

15:36.800 --> 15:37.800
SurveyMonkey.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.840
We do surveys.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.960
Really challenging to try to get data through some corporate firewalls.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.480
So there are non-tariff barriers.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.200
Security.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.480
Very, very important.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.920
And there are lots of tools out there that can help developers better understand dependencies.

15:54.920 --> 16:02.360
And the number one benefit, it's the number one benefit of producing S-POMs.

16:02.360 --> 16:09.760
Better understanding the dependencies in your projects.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.200
Here is a truth.

16:12.200 --> 16:17.800
And I think, I don't know if anyone here would disagree, but devs are pretty amazing project

16:17.800 --> 16:19.400
ambassadors.

16:19.400 --> 16:26.880
Carol Payne from Netflix speaks publicly and often about the projects she contributes to,

16:26.880 --> 16:34.920
inspires other people to get involved, helps recruiting new developers to projects.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.440
And she feels that she has a responsibility to do that.

16:39.440 --> 16:44.080
And we see so many devs advocating because it's the right thing to do.

16:44.080 --> 16:48.680
And it's incredible to building a community.

16:48.680 --> 16:53.600
For all of those of you who are ambassadors for your project, keep up the good work.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
Make such a difference.

16:54.600 --> 17:02.920
And it's so nice to see people being the champion of one project or another.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.640
Open source development in particular has its benefits.

17:05.640 --> 17:15.000
I recently gave a talk to an organization that had a lot of people just working in a

17:15.000 --> 17:16.540
closed source environment.

17:16.540 --> 17:22.280
They are not necessarily aware of what the benefit is to working in open source.

17:22.280 --> 17:26.640
And of course everyone here knows that you have the opportunity to learn from others

17:26.640 --> 17:28.560
and build on the work of others.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.560
You don't actually have to go it alone.

17:30.560 --> 17:36.000
There's so much less pressure and less stress and tremendous upside.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.720
But these truths are not necessarily widely known.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.280
So that's what I have to do is say, look, these are great places, great spaces.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
There's a lot of benefit.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.440
Open source is a good thing.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.360
Take advantage of the opportunities.

17:49.360 --> 17:55.400
I am a different kind of ambassador telling the story about why open source actually works

17:55.400 --> 17:58.800
and what the value proposition is.

17:58.800 --> 18:06.360
And devs mitigate risk by this very openness, by accepting external viewpoints.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.880
One of the things that I had to come to terms with when I started working for the Linux

18:09.880 --> 18:16.720
Foundation is the open sourcing of the research development process.

18:16.720 --> 18:23.240
Having so many eyes on a research paper before it gets published, that was like a shock to

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
me.

18:24.240 --> 18:29.960
But because of the culture I am in at the Linux Foundation, I work with incredibly smart

18:29.960 --> 18:34.680
people and a whole bunch of different disciplines.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.520
They are all weighing in on my report.

18:38.520 --> 18:45.320
And I'll tell you something, I've never had such high quality research as a consequence.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.840
People genuinely care.

18:46.840 --> 18:51.160
Not necessarily in their job description, but they are weighing in on a document because

18:51.160 --> 18:52.960
they can.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
And so they do.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.920
And they genuinely want to make something better.

18:56.920 --> 19:02.600
So my experience is that this methodology really, really works to create high quality

19:02.600 --> 19:04.560
outcomes.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.520
Definitely onto something here.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.640
And yes, devs can further mitigate risk by taking personal responsibility of implementing

19:11.640 --> 19:18.320
security best practices, including the increasing use of multi-factor authentication tokens

19:18.320 --> 19:23.560
to increase greater account security.

19:23.560 --> 19:29.480
So we're spreading the word about how we can improve the security of software supply chains.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.040
What are the tools available?

19:31.040 --> 19:34.920
What resources do you need?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.920
We're really just getting started here.

19:37.920 --> 19:46.320
This particular factoid came from the report we published this year with the Laboratory

19:46.320 --> 19:51.240
of Innovation Science from Harvard, which was Census 2.

19:51.240 --> 20:00.480
Looking at essentially three software composition analysis firms, SNEAK, FOSSA and Synopsys,

20:00.480 --> 20:08.200
ran scans to identify the most commonly used application libraries so that we could have

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
a measure.

20:09.200 --> 20:14.040
It's not a perfect measure, but it is a measure of the most popular software.

20:14.040 --> 20:20.800
So if we know what the most widely used applications are, we can prioritize our efforts to secure

20:20.800 --> 20:22.120
them.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.480
That's the rationale behind some of the research we're doing.

20:24.480 --> 20:31.080
And that's where this particular point came from.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.960
And yes, you shoulder a lot of responsibility.

20:35.960 --> 20:43.000
The FOSS, Census 2 validated, again, that the most widely used free and open source

20:43.000 --> 20:48.720
software is developed by only a handful of contributors.

20:48.720 --> 20:56.240
In one dataset, 136 were responsible for more than 80% of the lines of code added to the

20:56.240 --> 21:00.660
top 50 packages.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.400
So how do we share that responsibility?

21:02.400 --> 21:05.240
I don't know, but we're working on it.

21:05.240 --> 21:09.320
If you have ideas, that's what we're here for.

21:09.320 --> 21:19.840
I want everybody here to take away the opportunity that research through the LF is a mechanism

21:19.840 --> 21:23.600
for you to be heard.

21:23.600 --> 21:30.000
If a stat seems wrong or, you know, if you have an opinion, let's hear your opinion.

21:30.000 --> 21:38.860
We would love nothing more than to hear from you so as to change programming and resourcing

21:38.860 --> 21:41.620
that will better support you.

21:41.620 --> 21:48.480
So let this be your mechanism to share your perspectives and knowledge.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.360
Toxicity and open source is real.

21:50.360 --> 21:58.280
It came through our, it was real before we did research on it, but one in five open source

21:58.280 --> 22:04.400
devs have been discriminated or felt unwelcome or professionals, I should say.

22:04.400 --> 22:13.320
And it is minority groups that are most acutely affected.

22:13.320 --> 22:20.040
The minority populations of our community really struggle in not feeling welcome and

22:20.040 --> 22:22.160
open source.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.680
And why is this such an issue?

22:23.680 --> 22:28.440
Well, it's really important because diverse technologies are better technologies.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.240
Diversity creates better tech.

22:30.240 --> 22:34.460
For the longest time, I'm from Canada, by the way, and we have a thing called postal codes

22:34.460 --> 22:40.860
which differ from zip codes and they differ from European postal codes as well.

22:40.860 --> 22:49.160
But because we're so often filling out forms specific to the United States, I'd like those

22:49.160 --> 22:52.240
forms to have an extra space where I can put my postal code in.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.640
Because that's just, you know, a technology frustration.

22:55.640 --> 23:02.480
If the designer of a form realized that they need more than zip codes for inclusion, like

23:02.480 --> 23:05.280
let's include the Canadians, that's great.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.840
That's how you get better technology.

23:06.840 --> 23:14.860
Think outside your lane and you increase opportunities for others to participate.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.360
And Rachel Rose from ILM.

23:16.360 --> 23:23.400
ILM is the Lucasfilm production unit.

23:23.400 --> 23:29.240
So Industrial Light and Magic is making all the Star Wars stuff and making some pretty

23:29.240 --> 23:34.720
good films with open source software.

23:34.720 --> 23:39.080
And nobody says it better when we have people with varied backgrounds and opinions, we get

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
better software.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.320
Thank you, Rachel.

23:42.320 --> 23:48.440
We've got upcoming research that's very specific to maintainers because of the responsibility

23:48.440 --> 23:51.560
that is shouldered on maintainers.

23:51.560 --> 24:01.000
And what we did before I jump into this particular point, after we published the second census

24:01.000 --> 24:04.920
report, census 2, that was scanning those application libraries to identify the most

24:04.920 --> 24:11.860
popular software, we tried to reach as many of those maintainers we could to have a conversation

24:11.860 --> 24:14.020
with them and say what is going on?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.020
What do you need?

24:15.020 --> 24:16.020
What are your challenges?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.020
What are your constraints?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.160
How's it going?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.400
Do you have a successor?

24:20.400 --> 24:22.100
What was your pathway to here?

24:22.100 --> 24:23.500
Are you paid?

24:23.500 --> 24:25.480
How much time is on your hands?

24:25.480 --> 24:31.080
And it is this methodology that is producing the next couple of slides.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.960
This report is still in development.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.480
We've got a really solid draft.

24:35.480 --> 24:41.640
But we will be publishing these insights at some point in the quarter.

24:41.640 --> 24:48.120
So really excited to get a window into the world of the maintainers of some of the most

24:48.120 --> 24:50.720
critical software in the world.

24:50.720 --> 25:00.600
And great quote that maintainership can fill an infinite amount of time if you let it.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.900
And that's true.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.640
Sometimes I feel that way about the Linux foundation.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.140
The more I give to the Linux foundation, the more it takes from me.

25:07.140 --> 25:12.680
But it's a gift that you give and you get so much back in return.

25:12.680 --> 25:19.520
I think this is true for maintainers, that they're just giving, giving, giving.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.880
That repo is always going to take it.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
Maintainers need tools.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.800
They need hacks.

25:26.800 --> 25:33.960
They need productivity tools that is going to improve their workflows.

25:33.960 --> 25:44.520
44% of developers want their employers to provide these artifacts, sandboxes and resources

25:44.520 --> 25:48.600
and things that help them do their jobs better.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.160
And money, though, is incredibly important.

25:51.160 --> 25:55.400
And Abigail's talk emphasized the need for funding.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.240
People have to eat.

25:57.240 --> 26:02.200
It is not the primary motivator for people to work on open source software projects.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.280
So it's not maintainer constraints and challenges.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.000
It's not something that money necessarily solves.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Money can't buy me more hours in my day.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.480
And it can't buy me sustainable legacy for my work.

26:17.480 --> 26:23.080
We need to approach things differently outside of financial terms alone.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.760
It is part of the equation.

26:24.760 --> 26:30.480
But it's not the motivating factor.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.520
And yeah, maintainership is very often a job.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.840
It is not a hobby.

26:34.840 --> 26:39.920
And the pressure for maintainers is to build features and not fix bugs.

26:39.920 --> 26:45.360
And that's an equation that we need to change and figure out how we do it when we have a

26:45.360 --> 26:50.200
community that is so constrained in terms of time.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.680
How do we motivate intrinsically what tools do we need to provide?

26:54.680 --> 27:03.240
We're hoping to answer more of these types of questions as we continue to do more research.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.320
So yes, please get involved.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.920
Get involved.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.280
Research is just a different kind of open source contribution.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.280
We issue badges.

27:12.280 --> 27:18.480
If you contribute to a research project, either by way of writing a forward or doing a peer

27:18.480 --> 27:23.840
review of a survey before it's published, maybe you're going to localize the survey

27:23.840 --> 27:31.120
to Japanese or Chinese or German or French, we've got an opportunity for you to get involved

27:31.120 --> 27:35.000
in this output.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.040
And there's nothing I love more than when Phil Holleran from GitHub shares his badge

27:41.040 --> 27:45.800
on LinkedIn and says, it was great to be a contributor to research.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.840
It was really, really rewarding.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.080
And it was as rewarding for me to work with Phil.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.360
I have enjoyed this experience immensely.

27:53.360 --> 28:00.320
I've learned so much in my two years of doing research for the LF and working with people

28:00.320 --> 28:07.760
all across the ecosystem from industry to community organizations.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.360
I come from the blockchain space.

28:09.360 --> 28:14.320
I did blockchain research previously, but I really do love the open source community.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.040
It's a great place.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.880
I would love nothing more for you all to sign up and receive our newsletter and to learn

28:21.880 --> 28:26.160
about opportunities to get more involved, to take surveys.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.920
This year we're going to launch a panel and hope to get as many people on that panel as

28:31.920 --> 28:38.280
possible so as to create better insight and to be given the opportunity to answer surveys

28:38.280 --> 28:42.840
and tell us what's going on, tell us how to fix it.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.880
So please stay in touch with us.

28:44.880 --> 28:49.560
We're going to have more news on the development of our survey panel this year.

28:49.560 --> 28:53.000
That's my mandate to create it.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.080
And I'd love nothing more than for you to be a part of it.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.720
And with that, thank you very much.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.480
I'll be very happy to try to answer your questions.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.480
Thank you.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.840
Thank you, Larry.

29:10.840 --> 29:18.160
We have questions.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.160
Questions?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.160
Sure.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
Yes.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.520
I will move to the slide, this one.

29:26.520 --> 29:37.640
Thank you.

29:37.640 --> 29:43.240
You showed us some statistics there which I found really interesting.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.280
What's the most surprising thing that's come out of research that you've done or worked

29:47.280 --> 29:49.400
on with Linux Foundation?

29:49.400 --> 29:52.640
Wow, that is a great question.

29:52.640 --> 30:01.480
What is the most surprising thing that I've learned through research?

30:01.480 --> 30:03.360
I am surprised every single day.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.800
Honestly, I learn so much every day.

30:05.800 --> 30:09.520
I'm humbled by the amount that I learn.

30:09.520 --> 30:19.120
I think what's fascinating is the community aspect of open source.

30:19.120 --> 30:27.240
And that this is a community by people that without community, we would not have this

30:27.240 --> 30:28.800
technology infrastructure.

30:28.800 --> 30:34.120
I think that's the most fascinating and inspiring thing that I have learned.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.920
It's really wonderful.

30:35.920 --> 30:36.920
Thanks.

30:36.920 --> 30:41.640
Thank you for your question.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.960
More questions?

30:42.960 --> 30:46.040
There's one over here.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.040
Over here.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
Sorry.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.040
Next aisle.

30:49.040 --> 31:00.760
Thanks for the presentation.

31:00.760 --> 31:05.080
I'm curious whether do you have any data on how much of the research that we have in the

31:05.080 --> 31:09.960
software industry that goes to open source software versus closed source software, proprietary

31:09.960 --> 31:10.960
software?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.280
Do you have any data on that?

31:12.280 --> 31:15.840
No, we have not done any research of that nature, I'm afraid.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.760
It's an excellent question.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.360
There are so many questions to answer.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.200
That's an excellent question.

31:22.200 --> 31:28.120
Another question that we get a lot and still have not found a good way to answer is what

31:28.120 --> 31:33.400
is the consumption of open source or the usage.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.640
We know there are a lot of downloads but we don't necessarily have a good way of measuring

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
usage.

31:38.640 --> 31:39.640
Very challenging to track.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.560
It's a challenging space to research.

31:41.560 --> 31:53.640
But good question.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.880
Thank you.

31:54.880 --> 31:59.400
You had a slide on diversity, a quote.

31:59.400 --> 32:04.640
My personal observation on developers is that there's not so many women amongst them.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.960
Is it also a topic of the Linux foundation to look into that?

32:08.960 --> 32:15.160
Or has some research been done to find the reason why that is and how to overcome them

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
at some point?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Yeah.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.120
So why are there so few women in open source is part of I'm going to go back to that slide

32:22.120 --> 32:27.360
so that you can see you can download the report.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
Actually here it is.

32:28.360 --> 32:35.640
So in this report we do offer some insight as to how we can help overcome the fact that

32:35.640 --> 32:43.360
we have diversity challenges and why we struggle to recruit women.

32:43.360 --> 32:50.040
I've come to learn through my exploration of COBOL as a programming language a little

32:50.040 --> 32:59.560
bit of the history about programming languages and computer science becoming more high value

32:59.560 --> 33:06.480
work and engineering becoming more high value work and society.

33:06.480 --> 33:13.760
It actually migrated from women programmers to men in the 60s.

33:13.760 --> 33:19.120
The first programmers, the film Hidden Figures, Women Using FORTRAN.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.600
It was not necessarily a high skilled activity.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.500
In fact COBOL is an incredibly teachable skill.

33:26.500 --> 33:32.320
And there's an amazing opportunity to skill up anybody who wants to learn how to code.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.000
They generally can.

33:34.000 --> 33:42.480
But over time computer engineering became deemed to be high value work and became the

33:42.480 --> 33:45.240
work of men exclusively.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.760
And the technology industry broadly, this is a function of tech in general, the math,

33:49.760 --> 33:52.260
the sciences, the humanities.

33:52.260 --> 33:59.760
I don't think that we've done our daughters a great service in socializing them into the

33:59.760 --> 34:00.760
sciences.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.920
I was not socialized into tech.

34:02.920 --> 34:12.880
But I see that LEGO, one of the best toys I ever played with as a child, has been marketed

34:12.880 --> 34:15.640
not as a gender neutral toy anymore.

34:15.640 --> 34:21.840
There's LEGO friends in the pink boxes and there's the helicopters and the other stuff.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.400
And that's marketed in the boys section.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.660
And I think that's unfortunate.

34:25.660 --> 34:30.160
Because the type of LEGO products that are marketed for girls are around, it's a house

34:30.160 --> 34:34.320
or it's a bakery or it's a beauty shop.

34:34.320 --> 34:38.640
So if I play with LEGO, I'm playing with the beauty shop and the shopping mall.

34:38.640 --> 34:45.760
But if I buy the other color of LEGO, I'm building the Death Star, the Star Wars station

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
or the helicopter.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.760
That's really a problem.

34:48.760 --> 34:54.520
So I think we have generational change to make the way we socialize girls and the way

34:54.520 --> 34:58.280
we socialize boys to do nontraditional activities as well.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.240
And we're in a real non-binary kind of world.

35:02.240 --> 35:10.360
And we have to think about how we socialize for the next generation.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.360
More questions?

35:13.360 --> 35:17.800
No questions.

35:17.800 --> 35:22.920
It's drink time.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
Thank you everybody.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.960
Is that, were there any more questions?

35:25.960 --> 35:26.960
Didn't think so.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.080
I see no hands.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.080
This is awesome.

35:29.080 --> 35:31.920
Thank you so much for coming at the very end of the day.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
You were great.

35:32.920 --> 35:33.920
Thank you.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.920
Thank you.

35:34.920 --> 35:35.920
Thank you.

35:35.920 --> 36:01.920
Thank you.
