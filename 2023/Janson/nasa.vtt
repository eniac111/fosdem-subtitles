WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.020
Thank you very much for having me here at Fostem.

00:08.020 --> 00:14.100
This is my first Fostem and as part of the feedback from the organizers for my talk was

00:14.100 --> 00:19.900
it sounds like something that could be an upbeat, great way to end the meeting with

00:19.900 --> 00:24.340
lots of pretty pictures and I've done my best to fill this with lots of pretty pictures.

00:24.340 --> 00:27.940
And so hopefully I'll meet the expectations.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.260
I'm Steve Crawford.

00:29.260 --> 00:34.200
I'm the science data officer as part of the chief science data office of the science mission

00:34.200 --> 00:36.340
directorate of NASA.

00:36.340 --> 00:42.980
And I'm really excited here today to talk to you about NASA and open source software.

00:42.980 --> 00:48.000
And so just to give a little preview of what I'll be talking about, I'll start off with

00:48.000 --> 00:54.760
software and the importance of it to NASA, recent open source software success stories,

00:54.760 --> 01:02.000
challenges with open software, open source science, and then opportunities.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.260
And I think probably most everyone is familiar with NASA.

01:07.260 --> 01:15.300
But I want to share with you that NASA's vision is to reach new heights and reveal the unknown

01:15.300 --> 01:18.020
for the benefit of all humankind.

01:18.020 --> 01:21.480
And this image is I think a great encapsulation of this.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.540
Going to the moon was obviously reaching new heights.

01:24.540 --> 01:29.520
And this image of Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 mission landing on the moon.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.760
But it captures him actually in the act of a science experiment.

01:33.760 --> 01:39.120
They're actually capturing information about the solar winds on the surface of the moon

01:39.120 --> 01:43.320
and actually trying to better understand how our sun works and interacts with the different

01:43.320 --> 01:47.520
bodies and trying to actually explore heat of physics, which is one of the main areas

01:47.520 --> 01:49.620
we do research on.

01:49.620 --> 01:54.940
And so that is actually a key bit of NASA, not only to explore the universe and to explore

01:54.940 --> 01:59.400
our solar system and our atmosphere, but also to actually understand it.

01:59.400 --> 02:05.160
And so trying to actually understand for the benefit of everyone is a key part of NASA.

02:05.160 --> 02:13.060
And at the heart of that, an integral part of that and what makes NASA possible is software.

02:13.060 --> 02:18.720
Every mission, every bit of research that NASA does, there's software involved in it.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.960
And a great example is the Apollo software.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.880
And here's two of the people who are leaders and involved in it, Mary Jackson, who started

02:26.880 --> 02:33.880
work at the computers, the very early computers as part of NASA to actually work and then

02:33.880 --> 02:36.200
became one of the lead engineers.

02:36.200 --> 02:41.360
And Margaret Hamilton, who helped lead the team that was designing the control and command

02:41.360 --> 02:45.040
software for the Apollo 11 mission at MIT.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.120
And this software is actually released and made openly available.

02:49.120 --> 02:54.680
You can see an example of the scan of one of the early software.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.000
It's available online.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.680
It's also been converted to GitHub.

02:58.680 --> 03:02.160
If you actually want to actually take a look at the software and the code from the Apollo

03:02.160 --> 03:05.360
mission, it's there and available.

03:05.360 --> 03:10.560
Software has been a key part for all of our different missions, but NASA also has a long

03:10.560 --> 03:15.560
history of making the software openly available.

03:15.560 --> 03:22.120
And that sharing is part of NASA's DNA as part of the law that created NASA, the Space

03:22.120 --> 03:23.960
Act.

03:23.960 --> 03:29.360
In section 203, one of the aspects was to provide for the widest practical and appropriate

03:29.360 --> 03:34.600
dissemination of information concerning its activities and results thereof.

03:34.600 --> 03:43.160
Part of our congressionally mandated law is to actually share what we do and disseminate

03:43.160 --> 03:44.540
appropriately.

03:44.540 --> 03:49.400
We do always have to be concerned about security and keeping things safe, but we also want

03:49.400 --> 03:53.200
to actually share as much possible as we do.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.560
And today we're doing that through our different directories.

03:56.560 --> 04:02.740
We have our Exploration Systems Directorate with Artemis launching and aiming to go back

04:02.740 --> 04:05.560
to the moon and then Mars beyond it.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.320
We have our Space Operations Mission Directorate, which is actually focused on the International

04:09.320 --> 04:13.320
Space Station and about operations and living in space.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.920
We have our Science Mission Directorate, which I'm part of, which actually explores our universe

04:16.920 --> 04:18.800
and our Earth.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.160
And we also have our Space Technology and Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, which

04:22.160 --> 04:27.300
actually are designing the technology that enable the exploration and discoveries made

04:27.300 --> 04:29.160
by the other directorates.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.760
I'm going to focus most of the rest of my talk on the Science Mission Directorate, but

04:32.760 --> 04:38.520
a lot of what I say for SMB also applies to these other activities.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.000
And so what does the Science Mission Directorate do?

04:41.000 --> 04:44.480
Well, it has three key science themes.

04:44.480 --> 04:50.680
These are to protect and improve life on Earth and space, search for life elsewhere, and

04:50.680 --> 04:57.720
that can be either within the solar system or planets circling around other stars, and

04:57.720 --> 05:00.200
remember the secrets of the universe.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.760
And so these are three, I think it's fair to say, pretty big questions that affect all

05:04.760 --> 05:06.760
of humanity.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.240
And that's what we're actually working at in the Science Mission Directorate to try and

05:10.240 --> 05:13.520
answer these questions.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
And how do we do that?

05:14.520 --> 05:17.200
Well, we do it through our fleet of missions.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.520
And so these are the different missions that the Science Mission Directorate have in orbit

05:21.520 --> 05:26.400
around the Earth, have in orbit around other planets or the sun, or have exploring the

05:26.400 --> 05:27.600
universe.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.600
And we have a wide range of Earth-observing satellites.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.400
We have a number of experiments going on on the International Space Station.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.880
We have a wide range of different explorers that have visited Mars.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.400
We also have observations of the sun.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.440
And we have our space telescopes and our space observatories observing the deepest reaches

05:49.440 --> 05:50.440
of the universe.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.280
And I just want to take a pause, though, as I take a look at and a very important aspect

05:55.280 --> 06:00.400
of this chart is that a lot of these missions, actually all of these missions, are done with

06:00.400 --> 06:01.560
our partners.

06:01.560 --> 06:06.920
NASA, even though NASA, everyone knows the NASA name and the NASA brand, so much of what

06:06.920 --> 06:09.280
NASA does is with others.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.840
It's with the community.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.240
We do it with our partners at the European Space Agency, at the Canadian Space Agency,

06:15.240 --> 06:16.420
at JAXA.

06:16.420 --> 06:21.400
We do it with the contractors and other agencies which are around the world that we partner

06:21.400 --> 06:22.440
with and work with.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.440
We also do it with the wider community.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.120
Some of these missions are NASA-led.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.360
Some are led by our partners.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.780
But really, I think there's actually one aspect which is actually very similar to open source

06:35.780 --> 06:42.360
where the missions and projects with NASA do take a very wide community in order to

06:42.360 --> 06:46.440
actually achieve these projects.

06:46.440 --> 06:51.520
And so I want to actually look at some of the success stories with these projects.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.760
And the first one I want to take a look at is Ingenuity.

06:53.760 --> 06:59.920
I'm going to play Ingenuity as part of the Mars Preseverance mission.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.240
Mars Preseverance is on the surface of Mars.

07:03.240 --> 07:10.200
It landed there in 2021 to explore Jezero Crater, an ancient delta on Mars.

07:10.200 --> 07:17.160
This was an area that was once rich with water and was sent there to actually explore whether

07:17.160 --> 07:19.780
or not the potential for life in that area.

07:19.780 --> 07:24.780
As part of that mission, there's a demonstrator on it, which is the Ingenuity drone copter.

07:24.780 --> 07:27.880
And you can see the first flight of it here.

07:27.880 --> 07:34.800
This is the first flight of a human-made object anywhere else in the solar system.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.320
And so we're actually flying a copter on another planet.

07:39.320 --> 07:48.200
Since the first flight, it's been repeated and has flown over 40 separate flights during

07:48.200 --> 07:49.200
the last two years.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.200
It's still flying.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
It's still exploring.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.560
This was something that was expected to make about five flights.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.400
And I'll just play that again.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.760
But it's driven by open source software.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.720
F Prime is the open source flight control software for this.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.920
And this framework was used for this project.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.440
It was released by JPL in 2017.

08:09.440 --> 08:14.720
And so this drone copter is flown by open source software.

08:14.720 --> 08:21.360
And one of the great things that happened to celebrate this accomplishment is that NASA

08:21.360 --> 08:27.560
and JPL partnered with GitHub to actually recognize all those who have contributed to

08:27.560 --> 08:28.560
this mission.

08:28.560 --> 08:33.480
And they didn't actually just to those who actually contributed to the F Prime repository.

08:33.480 --> 08:40.920
They also contributed and recognized all the others through a badge of the Mars 2020 helicopter

08:40.920 --> 08:49.720
badge, which recognized all the dependencies and all the other packages and software that

08:49.720 --> 08:54.240
was involved in and part of this project.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.960
And so this actually was over 12,000 people who contributed to these dependencies and

08:58.960 --> 09:02.680
these different packages which made this project possible.

09:02.680 --> 09:08.000
These contributors are from all around the world and have been contributing to open source

09:08.000 --> 09:15.680
and a wide range of different open source projects which made flight on Mars possible.

09:15.680 --> 09:24.960
Another project, and this one is personally important to me because it's one that I've

09:24.960 --> 09:28.840
contributed directly to, is the James Webb Space Telescope.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.760
This was launched just over a year ago.

09:31.760 --> 09:36.840
And it is a partnership between NASA, European Space Agency, ESA, and the Canadian Space

09:36.840 --> 09:39.200
Agency.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.160
And I really want to actually once again actually like emphasize the fact that these projects,

09:43.160 --> 09:49.320
these massive projects which took almost 30 years to build, was an international collaboration

09:49.320 --> 09:56.520
with a wide range of different agencies across different NASA centers, 14 different countries,

09:56.520 --> 09:58.560
including Belgium right here.

09:58.560 --> 10:04.520
Part of the Miri spectrograph was built here in Belgium along with actually one of the

10:04.520 --> 10:08.280
leads for the Miri spectrograph, the law resolution spectrograph.

10:08.280 --> 10:13.000
Sarah Kendra was actually born and raised in Belgium.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.720
And so these projects take a wide range and a large community to actually support and

10:20.720 --> 10:24.720
actually produce these projects.

10:24.720 --> 10:30.400
And so the wonderful and beautiful thing is that after its launch and after its commissioning,

10:30.400 --> 10:34.880
James Webb Space Telescope did start to produce beautiful, beautiful images.

10:34.880 --> 10:39.160
And so Jade was tea is here as one of the first images of the Carina Nebula.

10:39.160 --> 10:46.160
This is a small part of the overall image or a small part of the overall nebula showing

10:46.160 --> 10:53.600
the dust clouds which are actually home to new stars which are forming there.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.240
And not only is it producing imaging, but it's also producing spectra.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.640
And this is an example and one of the first spectra of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

11:01.640 --> 11:04.320
of another of a planet orbiting another star.

11:04.320 --> 11:09.160
So it's in the atmosphere of a planet which is orbiting another star and it's detected

11:09.160 --> 11:14.480
by the spectrograph and by looking at as that planet passes in front of the star, you

11:14.480 --> 11:17.040
can actually do observations of it.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.600
You subtract off the effects of the star and you can actually see what the spectrum of

11:21.600 --> 11:24.000
that atmosphere of that planet is.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.960
This is the first detection of CO2 and this came out roughly about a month after we started

11:28.960 --> 11:30.880
producing public data from the telescope.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.160
We started releasing data.

11:33.160 --> 11:37.200
And here's a great quote from Natasha Patalje who is one of the leads on it, that NASA's

11:37.200 --> 11:41.280
Open Science Guidance Principles are centered in our early release science work supporting

11:41.280 --> 11:45.260
an inclusive, transparent and collaborative scientific process.

11:45.260 --> 11:49.680
They could actually produce their science so quickly in one month, this discovery one

11:49.680 --> 11:55.280
month after they started releasing data because of Open Science and Open Source software.

11:55.280 --> 12:00.880
They're able to test their software and their processes before the launch of the telescope

12:00.880 --> 12:04.360
because all the calibration software was made publicly available.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.520
The data for this project, for our early release projects were made publicly available as soon

12:09.520 --> 12:12.320
as they were observed.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.800
And they also are a great example of Open Science as well.

12:15.800 --> 12:21.040
They've made all their data, all of their software and all of their results openly accessible

12:21.040 --> 12:22.040
as well.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.680
So if you want to actually go and reproduce this spectra for yourselves, you can actually

12:25.680 --> 12:32.000
go and download their software which is uploaded to Zenodo and take a look at it.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.320
And so as I said, this is all made possible by having the software made openly available

12:37.320 --> 12:41.720
and this is part of all the Jade with Sea calibration software, the software which is

12:41.720 --> 12:49.080
actually used to actually produce and science calibration and science ready images is all

12:49.080 --> 12:52.440
openly developed on GitHub.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.120
It enables scientists to test their projects before it became available but also allows

12:56.120 --> 13:00.680
them to feed back to the project, to actually, when they find bugs or when they find a better

13:00.680 --> 13:05.560
algorithm for calibrating the data, they can contribute it back to the program so that

13:05.560 --> 13:09.920
it actually can then be shared with a wider audience.

13:09.920 --> 13:14.000
And one thing that actually makes this available is it builds on the wider scientific Python

13:14.000 --> 13:18.640
environment and then contributes back to that community as well.

13:18.640 --> 13:23.720
And the way that this did it was it contributes and JBST and that team contributes back to

13:23.720 --> 13:25.320
the Astropy project.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.480
And this is a common Python library for astronomy.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
It builds on NumPy.

13:29.480 --> 13:36.360
And it started in 2011 basically from an astronomy and Python mailing list.

13:36.360 --> 13:41.240
People had been actually emailing on the list saying I've just released a new generalized

13:41.240 --> 13:45.600
package for astronomy and after about the third email someone said why don't we all

13:45.600 --> 13:47.760
work together?

13:47.760 --> 13:51.440
And basically everyone did actually agree to that.

13:51.440 --> 13:56.480
We ended up getting together and working together to produce a generalized astronomy package.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.480
And not only was it graduate students and software engineers and astronomers from around

14:01.480 --> 14:05.280
the world but it also included those software engineers and astronomers working on some

14:05.280 --> 14:10.800
of our biggest projects like the Hubble Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

14:10.800 --> 14:15.520
Since it's actually released it's been used in over 10,000 publications making it really

14:15.520 --> 14:18.480
widely available and widely used.

14:18.480 --> 14:24.000
But we do have, you know, and on the images from the recent paper of showing actually

14:24.000 --> 14:27.360
where it's being used and where it's available.

14:27.360 --> 14:32.840
And you can see it's all over the world but along with that the dots on the graphic represent

14:32.840 --> 14:36.720
where the maintainers from the project are.

14:36.720 --> 14:40.840
Where the people who've been contributing to the project and they're spread out through

14:40.840 --> 14:47.920
both North America and Europe with some South American and global south representation as

14:47.920 --> 14:50.640
well.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.080
And so I'm just going to pause again here and I'm going to put up another JWST early

14:55.080 --> 14:59.880
release image which is the Galaxy cluster SMAC0723.

14:59.880 --> 15:06.560
And this image also has a lot of importance to me because when I was doing my PhD in astronomy

15:06.560 --> 15:09.280
I studied objects which were very similar to this.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.920
Galaxy clusters are some of the largest, they are the largest gravitationally bound objects

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
in the universe.

15:14.920 --> 15:21.240
They're the most massive objects having billions and billions of solar masses of billion billions

15:21.240 --> 15:25.760
times more massive than our own sun and are the largest collections of objects.

15:25.760 --> 15:31.040
And what you're seeing in this image is not only the galaxies which are part of this cluster

15:31.040 --> 15:33.800
but you're also seeing the effects of general relativity.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.160
They're bending the light from the galaxies which are behind them.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.760
Only a few hundred million or billion years older than the big bang.

15:42.760 --> 15:49.440
And they're bending that light due to the mass of that galaxy is warping the space and

15:49.440 --> 15:53.280
time around it to focus those light on those background galaxies on us.

15:53.280 --> 15:58.360
And we're seeing that through those galaxies which are streaked and bent around it.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.720
These are the background galaxies around it.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.440
And as I said, during my PhD I studied objects like this, galaxy clusters.

16:04.440 --> 16:10.880
And when I was writing my PhD I wrote code in C and in Perl and I would put it into a

16:10.880 --> 16:14.880
tar ball and put it up on my own personal website.

16:14.880 --> 16:20.400
And after I had gotten my PhD and moved down, I actually moved down to South Africa to work

16:20.400 --> 16:23.560
on a telescope there called the Southern African Large Telescope.

16:23.560 --> 16:27.520
And I had to build a data management system for it except we had no resources.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.840
I was the only resource.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.480
And so I turned to the open source software.

16:32.480 --> 16:38.280
I turned to free software to actually use a wide variety of resources to build a very,

16:38.280 --> 16:42.880
very cost effective data management system for it.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.240
And during, you know, and it actually helped make it one of the most productive 10 meter

16:46.240 --> 16:48.200
class telescopes.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.980
During that time was when I was working down there when I received that email about Astro

16:52.980 --> 16:53.980
Pi.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.320
And it was, you know, this is my actual, even though I'd been releasing software, this is

16:57.320 --> 17:02.720
really my start into open source software where it actually is getting involved of a

17:02.720 --> 17:07.400
community of like minded people who wanted to actually solve a similar problem.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.360
And it was really actually when I saw the potential of actually working together and

17:11.360 --> 17:15.680
sharing our software and how we did things that actually really solved the power of open

17:15.680 --> 17:17.800
source software.

17:17.800 --> 17:24.520
And, you know, that's actually then, and if you told me about 10 years ago or so that

17:24.520 --> 17:29.640
I'd be here talking to you now having actually worked in South Africa for a while and then

17:29.640 --> 17:34.280
moved on to work and manage the team that was developing the JBC calibration software

17:34.280 --> 17:40.760
and now working at NASA sharing open science across all of our different divisions and

17:40.760 --> 17:45.320
helping to further open the science, I wouldn't have actually believed you if you told me

17:45.320 --> 17:49.320
that 10 years ago that this is where getting involved in open source would have actually

17:49.320 --> 17:51.520
eventually led me to.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.780
But I'm here now and it's been actually really, really fascinating to hear all the immense

17:56.780 --> 18:01.360
and fantastic open source work which has been going on at this conference.

18:01.360 --> 18:07.080
But I just want to actually show, you know, going back to what NASA does, this is less

18:07.080 --> 18:10.360
than 1% of the open source used by NASA.

18:10.360 --> 18:15.200
This is just a, basically NASA and the wide range of NASA projects is touching on just

18:15.200 --> 18:18.800
about every bit of open source that you can imagine.

18:18.800 --> 18:24.440
Likewise NASA and the people working at NASA release a huge amount of open source.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.440
This is less than 1% of the open source that's being released by NASA.

18:28.440 --> 18:35.080
And it's a wide range of different projects touching on both planetary science, astronomy,

18:35.080 --> 18:41.640
astrophysics, earth science, along with technology development and other aspects.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.640
NASA loves to actually spin off the things that we're doing.

18:44.640 --> 18:50.440
NASTRAM was a program for engineering and fine element analysis developed in the 60s

18:50.440 --> 18:52.920
and released as public domain in the 70s.

18:52.920 --> 19:00.200
It now underlines, it still underlines a number of engineering codes which are out there and

19:00.200 --> 19:07.200
own engineering software which is out there, but NASA loves to actually spin out our projects.

19:07.200 --> 19:15.320
Another two examples of our spinoffs is OpenStack which is underlying on premise cloud computing.

19:15.320 --> 19:21.000
We still use this in our ADAPT supercomputer center and for our on premise cloud computing

19:21.000 --> 19:22.680
it's still often used.

19:22.680 --> 19:29.040
But we've, with Rackspace we've handed this over to the community and to the wider community

19:29.040 --> 19:30.480
to further develop.

19:30.480 --> 19:35.920
OODT is another program that was developed for data management and for handling files,

19:35.920 --> 19:40.800
likewise handed over to the Apache Foundation for that to be further developed to the community.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.720
We're still, NASA is still a participant in it, NASA still uses some of this software,

19:45.720 --> 19:49.880
but we are now just a member of a much larger community which are using these different

19:49.880 --> 19:52.080
projects.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.600
But sometimes it's still important for us to actually take the lead and develop our

19:55.600 --> 19:57.640
software ourselves.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.520
And the JPL SPICE toolkit is an example of this.

20:00.520 --> 20:07.400
This is for spacecraft ephemeris, planet satellite comet or asteroid ephemeris' instrument information,

20:07.400 --> 20:10.200
orientation information and events information.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.200
This is a software that you use if you want to know a comet or an asteroid that you want

20:14.200 --> 20:16.560
to land on will be in ten years.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.200
This is how we actually determine the positions and velocities of spacecraft, of planets,

20:21.200 --> 20:25.360
of other objects which are all moving throughout our solar system.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.360
This is, this software needs to be incredibly precise.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.000
If you get something wrong now in a very small amount and you try and land on your comet

20:33.000 --> 20:39.320
in ten years, you will be nowhere close to it and you will have no hope of recovering.

20:39.320 --> 20:44.360
And so there actually is a very, very rigorous process to actually contribute and to actually

20:44.360 --> 20:45.880
make changes to this code.

20:45.880 --> 20:51.160
It's made very slowly, very carefully because once again if you even get the floating points

20:51.160 --> 20:55.480
a little bit off or depending on even how the hardware works or specific hardware, you

20:55.480 --> 20:57.720
may get different results.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.640
And there is actually, and it was primarily originally developed in C and they did release

21:01.640 --> 21:04.200
some other interfaces for it.

21:04.200 --> 21:08.120
And it is released as open source but it's not openly developed currently.

21:08.120 --> 21:14.600
This is something funded by the planetary data system and so there is actually regular

21:14.600 --> 21:21.120
support for it and it's a great team that is currently further developing it.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.640
But there's also wrappers that have been developed for it.

21:23.640 --> 21:31.040
And Andrew Nx developed Spice Pi which is a Python wrapper for this toolkit and it's

21:31.040 --> 21:33.120
been used in a wide range of different missions.

21:33.120 --> 21:36.800
It's actually now used by 80% of all spice users.

21:36.800 --> 21:42.960
It's been used in Konsini of the Mars orbiter.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.480
It's very widely used in our range of different missions.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.960
But Andrew developed this when he was an undergraduate.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.480
He was working on the Konsini mission and probably like a lot of people, he just wanted

21:53.480 --> 21:58.320
to use Spice and Python and at the time there wasn't a way to do it and so he solved the

21:58.320 --> 21:59.320
problem.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.640
He developed and released it as open source software and everyone else started using it

22:03.640 --> 22:04.840
as well.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.740
And Andrew continued development for two years in his spare time while he was actually post

22:08.740 --> 22:15.000
his undergraduate and not even employed working on any of the missions.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.920
Fortunately enough he did go back for his PhD and he's now currently a postdoc at Caltech

22:18.920 --> 22:20.880
so he's doing fine.

22:20.880 --> 22:25.920
But even though it's actually so widely used it wasn't actually clearly about how it was

22:25.920 --> 22:33.300
being funded or the limited recognition, for example not very cited in the community even

22:33.300 --> 22:38.760
though it's actually becoming so critical to many projects that were actually actively

22:38.760 --> 22:39.760
using it.

22:39.760 --> 22:44.680
And so that gets us to some of the challenges of NASA and open source.

22:44.680 --> 22:49.680
And so as I mentioned one thing there was a good challenge of how do we actually go

22:49.680 --> 22:55.080
from something which is just being developed as someone trying to solve their own problem

22:55.080 --> 22:57.720
but then ends up being widely used in the community.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.320
How do we actually develop that model?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.480
NASA also contributes.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.840
People working at NASA also contribute to open source.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.960
Here's Leo Singer just last week contributing to an open source project because he needed

23:08.960 --> 23:15.000
to fix it and fix a bug in it to make it work for his use case.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
But oftentimes it's not actually very clear about how that actually works for the NASA

23:19.000 --> 23:22.920
employee or the person working at NASA.

23:22.920 --> 23:27.200
And this is also not always very clear about also when we need to do things like sign contributor

23:27.200 --> 23:30.680
license agreements or other aspects how that works.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.880
And so sometimes often people working on NASA will do it so they get it done but it's not

23:35.880 --> 23:40.360
really clear about how they should be doing it.

23:40.360 --> 23:45.540
There's also licensing at NASA.

23:45.540 --> 23:50.800
About 20 years ago NASA created the NASA open source agreement and they're trying to solve

23:50.800 --> 23:52.840
a very specific problem.

23:52.840 --> 24:00.240
Civil servants by US law civil servants can't produce work that is copyrightable.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.360
Most open source licenses actually work based on copyright.

24:04.360 --> 24:10.440
And so if you're not allowed to produce something that's copyrightable that you can copyright

24:10.440 --> 24:15.880
you can't use an existing open source license to actually protect it.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.200
They came up with the and there really wasn't much guidance in the US government at that

24:20.200 --> 24:23.320
time about releasing as open source software.

24:23.320 --> 24:28.280
And so they came up with actually a relatively innovative solution at the time which is this

24:28.280 --> 24:34.520
NOSA license to actually enable civil servants to release their software as open source following

24:34.520 --> 24:36.520
this framework.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.040
Unfortunately it isn't widely recognized in the community.

24:39.040 --> 24:44.160
It is not recognized by the Free Software Foundation and it does complicate the reuse

24:44.160 --> 24:47.180
of NASA software.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.080
We also have bureaucracy at NASA.

24:49.080 --> 24:54.020
NASA is a very large government agency.

24:54.020 --> 24:58.740
And sometimes even though NASA does have a process of releasing software and it's released

24:58.740 --> 25:04.920
over 500 officially released over 500 open source packages the processes can be long.

25:04.920 --> 25:09.400
We also not always best in engaging with the open source community and here's a tweet from

25:09.400 --> 25:15.720
Daniel Steinberg about getting emails from NASA asking us or asking him about the status

25:15.720 --> 25:22.580
of CURL and whether or not it can be actually used in different ways.

25:22.580 --> 25:26.120
And that's an additional burden for people who may be actually working on this in their

25:26.120 --> 25:29.000
volunteer time or not being paid.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.520
If we actually have to figure out if the software is secure or what the risks associated with

25:33.520 --> 25:38.900
that software are that should be our responsibility but actually how that works with the open

25:38.900 --> 25:45.520
source framework and open source communities can be actually different aspects.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.080
But CURL is actually something which is critical especially to our data management systems.

25:50.080 --> 25:56.080
It's being used very widely across NASA and how that actually comes into play and in different

25:56.080 --> 26:00.720
places ends up being something that we have to actually figure out how to actually resolve

26:00.720 --> 26:07.640
and actually make sure that the software that we're using is being used appropriately.

26:07.640 --> 26:13.320
I think there was a great talk earlier today on the security of software by Brian Bellendoff

26:13.320 --> 26:18.240
and that's going to be an ongoing question about how to answer that.

26:18.240 --> 26:24.760
And I always put up this XKCD comic on sustainability of open source software because it's better

26:24.760 --> 26:29.900
than if I could write 10 white papers and it won't have the same effect as this to actually

26:29.900 --> 26:35.200
indicate sometimes the problems and issues around sustainability.

26:35.200 --> 26:42.240
And all of our open source systems or not maybe not all of them but a lot of them do

26:42.240 --> 26:47.880
actually depend on a small number of developers who are actually maintaining it and keeping

26:47.880 --> 26:50.560
the code active and working.

26:50.560 --> 26:56.960
And there is actually and there was a great talk yesterday on the sustainability of open

26:56.960 --> 27:06.720
source and NASA does need reliable, secure and software especially for our space operations.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.360
And so what are we doing for the next steps?

27:09.360 --> 27:13.880
And within the science mission director we've actually started up a new couple of new things

27:13.880 --> 27:17.720
to actually help with this and help address some of these challenges.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.440
We've recently set up the Chief Science Data Office which I'm part of and as part of that

27:21.440 --> 27:23.760
we've set up the open source science initiative.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.920
This is one part of it is to help actually support open source software at NASA.

27:28.920 --> 27:35.520
The other part of it is also helping to extend open science across the entire mission directorate.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.640
And so what is open science?

27:37.640 --> 27:41.800
Open science is a principle and practice of making research products and processes available

27:41.800 --> 27:46.920
to all while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy and fostering

27:46.920 --> 27:51.680
collaborations, reproducibility and equity.

27:51.680 --> 27:56.240
And we really are focused on increasing accessibility, reproducibility and inclusion when we're actually

27:56.240 --> 28:02.440
working on open science across NASA.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.640
But within SMD we want to take that a step further.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.480
And this is why we started the open source science in practice.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.200
We definitely want to take not only just make our products openly available but we want

28:12.200 --> 28:17.080
to take the processes of science and open those up in much the way of open source software

28:17.080 --> 28:18.400
development.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.360
We want to open the entirety of the scientific process from start to finish.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.400
We want to broaden community involvement in the scientific process, increase accessibility

28:26.400 --> 28:31.560
of our data, software and publications and facilitate inclusion, transparency and reproducibility

28:31.560 --> 28:34.760
of science.

28:34.760 --> 28:41.680
And so with the NASA's open source science initiative we have, it is supporting scientists

28:41.680 --> 28:47.280
to integrate open science principles into the entirety of the research workflow.

28:47.280 --> 28:53.720
The NASA's OSSI is $20 million per year and we're hoping to actually increase that further

28:53.720 --> 28:57.360
effort to increase open science across NASA.

28:57.360 --> 29:02.360
We have four areas that we're mainly focusing on which is infrastructure, policy, funding

29:02.360 --> 29:04.800
and community.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.800
I'm going to touch on some of the work that we're doing in these three, at least the three

29:08.800 --> 29:11.680
different areas.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.320
And so one thing is new policy.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.200
And so last month we released the SMD's new policy on scientific information.

29:19.200 --> 29:24.760
We want to make things as open as possible, as restricted as necessary and always secure.

29:24.760 --> 29:30.240
And this new policy says that our publications, the research which is done and funded by NASA,

29:30.240 --> 29:34.560
are made openly available with no period of embargo.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.880
That our research data and software are shared at the time of publication, that they are

29:38.880 --> 29:44.960
made openly so that you can reproduce the science which is actually being done from

29:44.960 --> 29:45.960
our work.

29:45.960 --> 29:51.600
And that you're able to actually also then reuse that science to actually build on it.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.680
That our mission data are released as soon as possible and freely available.

29:55.680 --> 30:02.000
And that free is actually both free as in beer, there's no charge to actually using

30:02.000 --> 30:03.040
our data.

30:03.040 --> 30:09.160
We make it free to download, free to access that data, and free as in speech as there's

30:09.160 --> 30:12.520
no restriction in what you can do with that data.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.760
And so that you can actually go and do whatever you want with the data we release.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.560
That data will be released under a Creative Commons Zero license.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.680
So it's clearly in the public domain for everyone.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.400
That our unrestricted mission software is developed openly.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.760
We've learned these lessons from JWST that having that software available for everyone

30:32.760 --> 30:37.800
to actually be able to both have access to it and also reuse it improves how science

30:37.800 --> 30:39.000
is done.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.740
That we recognize software as a scientific product.

30:41.740 --> 30:45.000
Our software is just as critical to our research.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.600
And that we'll be using these common open source licenses like Creative Commons Zero

30:49.600 --> 30:55.160
for our data and permissive commonly used software licenses for our software like Apache,

30:55.160 --> 30:58.600
BSD or MIT licenses.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.600
And we encourage using and contributing to open source software as part of our missions

31:03.600 --> 31:06.440
and our research.

31:06.440 --> 31:10.560
But we're actually going to be also releasing further policies and updating further processes

31:10.560 --> 31:19.760
to make it easier for NASA employees and NASA people being working with NASA to contribute,

31:19.760 --> 31:21.560
release and use open source software.

31:21.560 --> 31:25.240
So there's more coming to make it easier.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.920
The other thing is we're directly funding open source software especially in the scientific

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
environment.

31:29.920 --> 31:35.600
In over the last two years we've selected over 16 proposals supporting 22 different

31:35.600 --> 31:38.760
projects which we're providing direct support to.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.840
This call was specifically for sustainability.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.240
We weren't asking for anything new.

31:43.240 --> 31:47.600
We weren't asking for new features or new products.

31:47.600 --> 31:53.160
What we were asking was please make sure this software works as best as you can and that's

31:53.160 --> 31:58.640
sustainable that we can actually continue to use this and we've supported this with

31:58.640 --> 32:03.480
over $3 million so far.

32:03.480 --> 32:07.640
We're also and this is the next thing that we're kicking off this year is NASA's transform

32:07.640 --> 32:08.960
to open science.

32:08.960 --> 32:13.960
There's some stickers that already I think have disappeared very quickly.

32:13.960 --> 32:18.360
But the NASA TOPS effort is a 40 million five year mission to accelerate adoption of open

32:18.360 --> 32:19.480
science.

32:19.480 --> 32:26.400
We're aiming to train 20,000 researchers to earn a NASA open science badge and certification

32:26.400 --> 32:29.560
which includes how to open source your software.

32:29.560 --> 32:34.400
We want to double the participation of historically excluded groups across NASA science and we

32:34.400 --> 32:38.400
want to enable five major scientific discoveries through open science principles.

32:38.400 --> 32:43.440
And we're going to do this through engagement, capacity sharing, incentives and coordination

32:43.440 --> 32:45.120
across the community.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.200
We're also following our own advice here.

32:48.200 --> 32:52.040
Everything that we're doing with this project is going to be open sourced on GitHub so that

32:52.040 --> 32:54.640
community members can contribute it.

32:54.640 --> 33:00.000
And we're kicking this all off with a year of open science of 2023.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.680
And this is the start of the project.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.200
As I said, it's all going to be up on GitHub.

33:06.200 --> 33:10.680
Definitely please check it out and please engage with the community.

33:10.680 --> 33:17.000
But we're also not the only U.S. government agency contributing to the year of open science.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.360
This month the White House did actually announce that 2023 would be a year of open science.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.840
And there's going to be more stuff being announced by other U.S. agencies as well.

33:25.840 --> 33:31.320
And we hope actually as many of you who are open and interested in science also take step

33:31.320 --> 33:37.360
forward to actually make your science and your results more open as well.

33:37.360 --> 33:45.840
And so I want to also talk about the opportunities for open for NASA and for using open science.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.520
And one of the most important things that we do and one of the most important aspects

33:49.520 --> 33:54.840
of or most immediate aspects of the science mission directorate is our contributions to

33:54.840 --> 34:00.840
the earth of studying the huge impacts of climate change, about how that will affect

34:00.840 --> 34:06.000
our future, issues around environmental justice and other issues.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.840
And the way we are supporting it is that we do make all of our NASA data open.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.360
We have over 70 petabytes of data which is available in the cloud and even more that's

34:15.360 --> 34:20.360
available in different systems that are open for you to use in any way that you like to

34:20.360 --> 34:23.080
help address these questions.

34:23.080 --> 34:29.800
We have open APIs through these data sets which is all developed on NASA GitHub and

34:29.800 --> 34:32.840
provide as open access to the wider community.

34:32.840 --> 34:40.040
We are making these available to users around the world to those who actually need the data

34:40.040 --> 34:43.400
and most impacted by it.

34:43.400 --> 34:48.640
And there's actually I know there's a big session here on the environmental impacts

34:48.640 --> 34:52.680
and there's a great talk this morning on and I wanted to share one of the examples from

34:52.680 --> 34:55.000
NASA, which is the power project.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
It provides solar and meteorological data sets for NASA research for supporting renewable

34:59.000 --> 35:03.280
energy and building energy efficient and agriculture needs.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.360
We have made all the data freely available.

35:05.360 --> 35:09.560
We've also partnered with AWS to make the data freely available on there so that you

35:09.560 --> 35:16.200
can have access to this almost one and this data set to actually develop the apps to build

35:16.200 --> 35:20.840
the open source tools on top of this to actually use it in different ways that you can.

35:20.840 --> 35:25.880
To actually answer some of the toughest questions that we have around climate change and our

35:25.880 --> 35:26.880
environment.

35:26.880 --> 35:32.360
But we're also putting actually another five petabytes of data openly available on AWS

35:32.360 --> 35:37.000
and we're also looking to provide it on other cloud providers as well so that the data is

35:37.000 --> 35:39.960
there where you need it and where you can use it.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.800
And so we're actually looking to actually put our data in places where it's most useful

35:43.800 --> 35:48.040
and to partner with as many different groups that we can to actually put that data in useful

35:48.040 --> 35:50.040
places.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.280
And this is only actually the start.

35:52.280 --> 35:57.440
It's coming up next is our Earth System Observatories which we're doing in partnerships with the

35:57.440 --> 36:02.640
European Space Agency and JAXA that are actually going to give even a closer view of the climate

36:02.640 --> 36:07.240
effects on Earth and actually a better study of how these different effects both on changing

36:07.240 --> 36:14.240
our surface, changing our world, changing our climate and our different particles.

36:14.240 --> 36:18.760
These are how produce over 600 petabytes of data.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.520
And we're going to make this all freely available and accessible to the world to be able to

36:22.520 --> 36:29.320
actually access it and look at it and build things on it to answer these questions.

36:29.320 --> 36:34.720
And so we also have a lot, as I mentioned, NASA has released already a lot of open source

36:34.720 --> 36:35.720
software.

36:35.720 --> 36:39.800
We have a number of different ways to discover what may actually be out there.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.840
Code.NASA.gov is our site for our open source software at NASA.

36:43.840 --> 36:47.580
It has over 500 projects which have been officially released.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.960
We also have just released the Science Discovery Engine.

36:50.960 --> 36:57.880
This is actually a system to actually explore both all of our different data sets, software

36:57.880 --> 37:02.480
design and technical documents across all of the science mission directory.

37:02.480 --> 37:07.240
It has a listing I think currently of about 44,000 different pieces of software that have

37:07.240 --> 37:12.640
been released by different NASA researchers and missions.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.200
We have the NASA software catalog.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.880
We also have the NASA GitHub which has over 500 repositories on it.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.360
But we also have all the different partners which are on GitHub.

37:20.360 --> 37:24.000
JPL has their software on GitHub, Space Telescope.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.280
It has the JBFC and the Hubble software on GitHub.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.880
There's also a lot of other people who have posted their own NASA research software around

37:31.880 --> 37:32.880
there.

37:32.880 --> 37:33.880
We also have the Astrophysics Data Service.

37:33.880 --> 37:39.160
And you can also search the Software Heritage Archive which is archiving a lot of software

37:39.160 --> 37:43.520
across a wide range of different domains.

37:43.520 --> 37:49.720
And so we're really actually looking ahead at the really big challenges and trying to

37:49.720 --> 37:51.680
answer the big questions.

37:51.680 --> 38:00.800
There's the DART mission which earlier this year impacted on an asteroid, on a Dephmoraphis

38:00.800 --> 38:04.880
which is circling around another asteroid to actually detect to see if we could actually

38:04.880 --> 38:06.720
change its trajectory.

38:06.720 --> 38:11.120
If we can actually change the directory early enough of an asteroid, we can hopefully make

38:11.120 --> 38:15.440
sure that it deflects and avoids the Earth by using for example the SPICE toolkit to

38:15.440 --> 38:19.240
actually study where it's actually going to be moving and predicting it.

38:19.240 --> 38:25.600
And hopefully, ideally, protect the planet and avoid the same fate as the dinosaurs.

38:25.600 --> 38:29.000
But obviously this is all building and this wide range is building off a wide range of

38:29.000 --> 38:31.520
open source software.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.800
And so we do need more people.

38:32.800 --> 38:37.560
We need more hands and more eyes and more brains with the diverse experiences to participate

38:37.560 --> 38:43.080
so we can ask the best questions and find the best solutions.

38:43.080 --> 38:47.740
And so someone had asked me on Macedon what would be the best way or how you can contribute

38:47.740 --> 38:54.400
to NASA open source and I wanted to actually share some of the different aspects.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.720
And so you can contribute directly to NASA open source code.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.040
It's available on GitHub.

39:00.040 --> 39:05.560
You can contribute to the open source software that's maintained by our partners at JPL or

39:05.560 --> 39:13.020
at Space Telescope or at the NASA Impact Project or the NASA DEVELOP Project or a wide range

39:13.020 --> 39:18.160
of different sources or at ESA and or at other groups that are actually contributing and

39:18.160 --> 39:20.240
answering scientific questions like CERN.

39:20.240 --> 39:25.920
So you can contribute directly to the open source code.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.560
But you can also keep contributing, building and sustaining your code.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.320
There's so much open source that NASA is using and so even just by participating in your

39:35.320 --> 39:41.580
own open source projects you're contributing to the NASA mission.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.960
And you can also come work with us.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.920
This can either be, you know, we're always hiring and also our partners and our contractors

39:48.920 --> 39:53.280
are always hiring and a lot of these are great places to work on open source.

39:53.280 --> 40:00.200
And so we also have great internship programs especially at NASA and at JPL and also always

40:00.200 --> 40:04.120
excited to have people come work with us or come work with our partners in Europe like

40:04.120 --> 40:06.400
the European Space Agency.

40:06.400 --> 40:11.160
We're always looking for great technical talent to help make contributions and help build

40:11.160 --> 40:14.480
our missions.

40:14.480 --> 40:21.180
And to help address these major questions that impact humanity and to have us help reach

40:21.180 --> 40:25.960
new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humanity.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.920
And whether or not we're asking questions of protect and improve life on Earth and space

40:29.920 --> 40:34.840
and trying to address questions around climate change, address questions around planetary

40:34.840 --> 40:40.780
protection, around questions around environmental justice.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.460
These are important questions that affect all of us.

40:43.460 --> 40:46.680
Whether or not we're searching for life elsewhere, either searching for life in our own solar

40:46.680 --> 40:52.200
system on Mars or Europa or Venus or searching for life around planets orbiting around other

40:52.200 --> 40:53.700
stars.

40:53.700 --> 40:57.400
And if we're trying to discover the secrets of the universe, trying to understand general

40:57.400 --> 41:03.320
relativity, trying to understand how our universe, our earliest galaxies have formed, trying

41:03.320 --> 41:06.180
to understand how black holes work.

41:06.180 --> 41:11.040
These are all the types of questions that we're trying to answer here at NASA.

41:11.040 --> 41:19.560
And so I just want to stop there and I'm almost at my end of my talk, but just actually want

41:19.560 --> 41:23.760
to end it with a little bit of audience participation.

41:23.760 --> 41:30.120
And so I do, if you did actually see during my talk software that you contributed to,

41:30.120 --> 41:33.840
can you raise your hand?

41:33.840 --> 41:38.760
So I mean, during my talk I could only show about 1% of the software out there.

41:38.760 --> 41:43.160
So if you actually know you actually contributed to some NASA software out there that's used

41:43.160 --> 41:46.440
by ESA or someone else, can you raise your hand?

41:46.440 --> 41:49.760
And you can see how many people are contributing to it.

41:49.760 --> 41:56.000
But as I said, there is even that wider range of software which is out there.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.720
And doing open source also means actually like being part of the community, which is

42:01.720 --> 42:08.960
actually developing guidance, developing licenses, growing the community, mentoring the community.

42:08.960 --> 42:13.080
And so if you're taking part in actually growing the open source community and governing the

42:13.080 --> 42:15.160
open source community, can you raise your hand?

42:15.160 --> 42:24.120
And so if you've been working on licenses and mentoring and inclusion, and for everyone

42:24.120 --> 42:29.640
else, for those who actually want to contribute, who want to actually help us explore the universe

42:29.640 --> 42:33.920
and help reveal the unknown.

42:33.920 --> 42:40.880
And so for all of you who are building, oh, I had one last one which was for those who

42:40.880 --> 42:45.440
helped volunteer and organized this conference so I could take my moment to share NASA's

42:45.440 --> 42:51.040
message with everyone, can you raise your hands for all those who volunteered because

42:51.040 --> 43:06.240
you're also helping with NASA's message.

43:06.240 --> 43:10.840
And so for everyone who raised your hand, I just really do want to say thank you for

43:10.840 --> 43:13.120
all of your contributions.

43:13.120 --> 43:14.240
Thank you for helping us out.

43:14.240 --> 43:19.680
And for those who will contribute in the future to open source and other projects, thank you

43:19.680 --> 43:21.800
for your future contributions.

43:21.800 --> 43:50.680
Thank you very much, everyone.
