1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.360
Hi, everyone.

2
0:00:10.360 --> 0:00:12.120
We are getting started right now.

3
0:00:12.120 --> 0:00:16.640
This upcoming keynote is called celebrating 25 years of open source.

4
0:00:16.640 --> 0:00:21.120
Our speaker is going to be Nick Vidal.

5
0:00:21.120 --> 0:00:22.120
Thank you.

6
0:00:22.120 --> 0:00:23.120
Good morning.

7
0:00:23.120 --> 0:00:24.120
Bonjour.

8
0:00:24.120 --> 0:00:25.120
Happy birthday, open source.

9
0:00:25.120 --> 0:00:30.400
Happy birthday, open source.

10
0:00:30.400 --> 0:00:33.600
25 years.

11
0:00:33.600 --> 0:00:35.600
Yeah.

12
0:00:35.600 --> 0:00:43.280
I had the pleasure to work with the OSI five years ago together with the board of directors.

13
0:00:43.280 --> 0:00:45.840
It was a huge success.

14
0:00:45.840 --> 0:00:51.960
We organized 100 activities across 40 events worldwide.

15
0:00:51.960 --> 0:00:54.680
All the major open source conferences.

16
0:00:54.680 --> 0:00:58.000
We plan to do this again this year.

17
0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:03.960
25 years is a huge milestone for the open source community.

18
0:01:03.960 --> 0:01:08.480
We need you to help celebrate this.

19
0:01:08.480 --> 0:01:14.040
I'm going to tell a bit about the history of open source.

20
0:01:14.040 --> 0:01:16.360
That's 25 years.

21
0:01:16.360 --> 0:01:20.240
Before that, we also have the history of free software.

22
0:01:20.240 --> 0:01:27.400
I'm going to attempt to give a talk about this in about 30 minutes.

23
0:01:27.400 --> 0:01:28.640
Let's see how that goes.

24
0:01:28.640 --> 0:01:33.840
I have a couple of milestones, a couple of timelines.

25
0:01:33.840 --> 0:01:34.960
Let's see.

26
0:01:34.960 --> 0:01:38.120
I've created a timeline here.

27
0:01:38.120 --> 0:01:44.880
I'm going to give three talks.

28
0:01:44.880 --> 0:01:47.920
Three timelines.

29
0:01:47.920 --> 0:01:49.240
Actually three acts.

30
0:01:49.240 --> 0:01:53.520
I'm going to first talk about the past of open source.

31
0:01:53.520 --> 0:01:56.880
Later I'm going to talk about the future of open source.

32
0:01:56.880 --> 0:02:00.520
Finally I'm going to talk about the present of open source.

33
0:02:00.520 --> 0:02:06.960
For the past of open source, I'm going to be covering 12 timelines.

34
0:02:06.960 --> 0:02:12.760
Mostly I'll be focusing on the open source timeline and on the free software timeline.

35
0:02:12.760 --> 0:02:15.200
Let's get started.

36
0:02:15.200 --> 0:02:21.720
I'm going to...

37
0:02:21.720 --> 0:02:28.960
Before talking about open source, let's go to the free software timeline.

38
0:02:28.960 --> 0:02:30.680
You can actually access this.

39
0:02:30.680 --> 0:02:34.400
It's anniv.co.

40
0:02:34.400 --> 0:02:37.320
Let's go here.

41
0:02:37.320 --> 0:02:40.520
Let's go back to 1955.

42
0:02:40.520 --> 0:02:44.560
This is a long time ago.

43
0:02:44.560 --> 0:02:48.760
In 1955 we had the shared user group.

44
0:02:48.760 --> 0:02:53.160
This was part of IBM way back then.

45
0:02:53.160 --> 0:02:58.200
People were starting to share source codes.

46
0:02:58.200 --> 0:03:07.080
This is how this mindset of sharing of codes.

47
0:03:07.080 --> 0:03:09.160
There was no open source back then.

48
0:03:09.160 --> 0:03:11.560
There was no free software back then.

49
0:03:11.560 --> 0:03:14.360
This mindset was already there.

50
0:03:14.360 --> 0:03:18.440
This is key to the human.

51
0:03:18.440 --> 0:03:21.640
They always shared knowledge.

52
0:03:21.640 --> 0:03:26.960
They started sharing codes with the shared user group.

53
0:03:26.960 --> 0:03:30.240
Later we can see here this is a funny one.

54
0:03:30.240 --> 0:03:34.160
If anyone remember the open letter to Hubbets.

55
0:03:34.160 --> 0:03:39.320
Bill Gates was not very keen to people sharing his codes.

56
0:03:39.320 --> 0:03:44.200
He was very angry about them.

57
0:03:44.200 --> 0:03:50.800
So, everyone shared their codes before.

58
0:03:50.800 --> 0:04:01.000
With Bill Gates coming and other companies, they started making the source codes proprietary.

59
0:04:01.000 --> 0:04:04.400
Looking at that, Richard Stalin, he didn't like it.

60
0:04:04.400 --> 0:04:06.960
A lot of developers didn't like this.

61
0:04:06.960 --> 0:04:13.320
They created a movement to go back to how it was before.

62
0:04:13.320 --> 0:04:20.640
About sharing knowledge, about sharing codes, about just making progress.

63
0:04:20.640 --> 0:04:26.520
He started GNU in 1983.

64
0:04:26.520 --> 0:04:34.040
In 1985 he founded the Free Software Foundation.

65
0:04:34.040 --> 0:04:40.040
The next year the definition was free software.

66
0:04:40.040 --> 0:04:41.560
I'm going to go over this.

67
0:04:41.560 --> 0:04:43.400
This is really important.

68
0:04:43.400 --> 0:04:47.040
Probably most of you know, but it's always good to repeat this.

69
0:04:47.040 --> 0:04:52.320
The definition of free software is the freedom to run the problem as you wish.

70
0:04:52.320 --> 0:04:55.600
That's the definition zero.

71
0:04:55.600 --> 0:05:02.400
One, the freedom to study how the problem works and change it.

72
0:05:02.400 --> 0:05:07.800
Number two, the freedom to redistribute copies to your neighbors.

73
0:05:07.800 --> 0:05:13.360
The third one, the freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others.

74
0:05:13.360 --> 0:05:14.360
These are the basics.

75
0:05:14.360 --> 0:05:20.240
This is the basic definition of free software.

76
0:05:20.240 --> 0:05:25.600
In 1989 it was created the GPL.

77
0:05:25.600 --> 0:05:28.200
A lot of people use GPL still today.

78
0:05:28.200 --> 0:05:30.400
It's one of the main lessons.

79
0:05:30.400 --> 0:05:32.680
We have the software in public interest.

80
0:05:32.680 --> 0:05:35.960
This was very important for Debian projects.

81
0:05:35.960 --> 0:05:44.960
As you see in the open source timeline, the Debian project shares a lot of similarities

82
0:05:44.960 --> 0:05:53.360
with the OSI because Bruce Perrin was there and he was fundamental on that.

83
0:05:53.360 --> 0:05:58.640
We have the software freedom conservancy that was created in 2006.

84
0:05:58.640 --> 0:06:06.160
The GPL version 3 released in 2007 and that's the timeline for the free software.

85
0:06:06.160 --> 0:06:08.480
Of course, this is an overview.

86
0:06:08.480 --> 0:06:18.040
If I miss something, please, this is available on GitHub and you can propose a milestone

87
0:06:18.040 --> 0:06:20.520
to be added.

88
0:06:20.520 --> 0:06:34.320
Let's go back and go to the open source timeline.

89
0:06:34.320 --> 0:06:41.040
Open source is not actually something that came out of nowhere.

90
0:06:41.040 --> 0:06:48.440
It has always was inspired by the free software movements.

91
0:06:48.440 --> 0:06:50.720
Those two are not different.

92
0:06:50.720 --> 0:06:55.600
The open source is a continuation of the free software movements.

93
0:06:55.600 --> 0:07:04.520
One of the key books that was very relevant at the time was the cathedral and the bazaar

94
0:07:04.520 --> 0:07:07.840
that was published by Eric Raymond.

95
0:07:07.840 --> 0:07:19.400
This book compared how software was developed on systems like Linux, which was very chaotic

96
0:07:19.400 --> 0:07:23.640
sometimes but it worked.

97
0:07:23.640 --> 0:07:34.520
How it was developed in proprietary software, it was a waterfall model.

98
0:07:34.520 --> 0:07:43.240
It was comparing those two models and explaining how building together in this distributed

99
0:07:43.240 --> 0:07:53.280
manner still works even for complex systems like Linux or San Mayo.

100
0:07:53.280 --> 0:07:59.480
This book inspired Netscape to publish, to make it open source.

101
0:07:59.480 --> 0:08:09.280
They wanted to attract global developers to help with their software.

102
0:08:09.280 --> 0:08:16.200
And finally, Christine Peterson, she created the open source label.

103
0:08:16.200 --> 0:08:22.840
This is really interesting to highlight how many of you knew that a woman was responsible

104
0:08:22.840 --> 0:08:25.200
for coining the term open source.

105
0:08:25.200 --> 0:08:27.480
Please raise your hands.

106
0:08:27.480 --> 0:08:33.960
You see, I always saw a few hands raised and this is really important.

107
0:08:33.960 --> 0:08:39.960
The reason why we're here today talking about open source is because of a woman.

108
0:08:39.960 --> 0:08:46.320
That's really special.

109
0:08:46.320 --> 0:08:50.160
The reason why she created the label open source is that she wanted to make it really

110
0:08:50.160 --> 0:08:54.820
friendly for business to realize the importance of free software.

111
0:08:54.820 --> 0:09:06.360
The free software label was not very well accepted.

112
0:09:06.360 --> 0:09:07.600
It didn't work out.

113
0:09:07.600 --> 0:09:14.480
But with the open source label, it was really magical and everything just went really well.

114
0:09:14.480 --> 0:09:20.920
The open source initiative was founded in February with Eric Raymond and Bruce Perrance

115
0:09:20.920 --> 0:09:23.400
from the Debian project.

116
0:09:23.400 --> 0:09:30.160
The definition was created based on the Debian free software guidelines.

117
0:09:30.160 --> 0:09:37.660
So as you can see, the Debian project and the OSI has a very strong relationship since the

118
0:09:37.660 --> 0:09:41.820
very beginning.

119
0:09:41.820 --> 0:09:45.320
We had the open source summit happening that year.

120
0:09:45.320 --> 0:09:49.320
As you can see, Jim O'Reilly, he started promoting this as well.

121
0:09:49.320 --> 0:09:57.000
A very good marketing just from the beginning with a lot of key people like Linus from the

122
0:09:57.000 --> 0:10:04.960
Linux, Larry Wall from Pearl, Brian from Apache, Eric from San Mayo, Giddu from Python.

123
0:10:04.960 --> 0:10:12.400
So a lot of very well-known developers got together to promote open source and this new

124
0:10:12.400 --> 0:10:17.440
label.

125
0:10:17.440 --> 0:10:24.120
Of course, not everyone was happy about this popularity of open source.

126
0:10:24.120 --> 0:10:26.120
One example is Microsoft.

127
0:10:26.120 --> 0:10:32.080
So they started spreading a lot of foods and we have the famous Halloween documents as

128
0:10:32.080 --> 0:10:35.520
well that was leaked.

129
0:10:35.520 --> 0:10:44.720
They really had a strategy to cue open source and free software, which was the idea of extending

130
0:10:44.720 --> 0:10:53.240
the software and creating proprietary things that they wouldn't share back and to break

131
0:10:53.240 --> 0:10:56.800
open source.

132
0:10:56.800 --> 0:11:01.280
They really did try to cue open source at the beginning.

133
0:11:01.280 --> 0:11:11.240
So in 1999, we had the OSI lessons list and the OSI logo, the keyhole, was created as

134
0:11:11.240 --> 0:11:19.320
well in 1999 and it's this one here.

135
0:11:19.320 --> 0:11:26.280
At the time, there were a lot of lessons that were coming out and this was challenging from

136
0:11:26.280 --> 0:11:30.880
a legal perspective because this created a lot of confusion.

137
0:11:30.880 --> 0:11:37.680
So one of the very important roles from the OSI was an attempt to bring all those lessons

138
0:11:37.680 --> 0:11:44.080
together, to see which ones were compatible or not, and to highlight only the main ones

139
0:11:44.080 --> 0:11:50.560
so we wouldn't have a proliferation of several lessons, which would be just very confusing.

140
0:11:50.560 --> 0:11:56.920
So the main ones, the most popular ones, are the Apache, the BST, the GPL, and MIT and

141
0:11:56.920 --> 0:12:01.120
they're still very popular today.

142
0:12:01.120 --> 0:12:09.120
Then five years ago, while we were celebrating the 20 years of open source, I'm not sure

143
0:12:09.120 --> 0:12:16.040
if you remember the Commons class and other lessons that came that year, they were trying

144
0:12:16.040 --> 0:12:21.600
to really say, hey, we're open source, but you can't share this, you can't distribute

145
0:12:21.600 --> 0:12:22.760
this.

146
0:12:22.760 --> 0:12:30.640
So this is a case of open source, it's not really open source, and the OSI board and

147
0:12:30.640 --> 0:12:32.080
everyone involved.

148
0:12:32.080 --> 0:12:38.280
While we were celebrating the anniversary, we were really fighting to defend the open

149
0:12:38.280 --> 0:12:42.720
source definition and I think we have succeeded.

150
0:12:42.720 --> 0:12:55.720
So I attempted to give you an overview of the history of free software and of open source

151
0:12:55.720 --> 0:12:57.840
and it's not just that.

152
0:12:57.840 --> 0:13:04.920
So this was inspired and has inspired a lot of movements.

153
0:13:04.920 --> 0:13:10.960
We have the free culture movements as well, highlighted by the Wikipedia.

154
0:13:10.960 --> 0:13:18.760
Wikipedia is about sharing knowledge, about sharing contents, about creating an encyclopedia

155
0:13:18.760 --> 0:13:26.160
that everyone can help and everyone can edit.

156
0:13:26.160 --> 0:13:32.760
You can also discuss the role of open source in business and how this has helped.

157
0:13:32.760 --> 0:13:35.360
So this is a huge timeline.

158
0:13:35.360 --> 0:13:47.200
Suzy, for example, is a very important company here in Germany and it was founded in 92.

159
0:13:47.200 --> 0:13:54.760
Red Hat is celebrating 30 years this year and it was an example that you can actually

160
0:13:54.760 --> 0:14:00.040
create a billion dollar business using only free and open source software.

161
0:14:00.040 --> 0:14:08.260
So this was really important and if you want to check out, there are so many stories here.

162
0:14:08.260 --> 0:14:13.960
So we have Suzy, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Androids.

163
0:14:13.960 --> 0:14:22.320
I think it's important to highlight also automatic the company behind WordPress.

164
0:14:22.320 --> 0:14:28.880
So today we have several people who use WordPress and develop WordPress and provide services

165
0:14:28.880 --> 0:14:32.240
using free and open source software.

166
0:14:32.240 --> 0:14:36.840
And there's a whole bunch of examples here on this timeline.

167
0:14:36.840 --> 0:14:44.400
If you want to check out, that's great.

168
0:14:44.400 --> 0:14:56.520
We also have open governments, how open source has influenced

169
0:14:56.520 --> 0:15:02.720
how governments are run, trying to make the government as transparent as possible to publish

170
0:15:02.720 --> 0:15:14.000
those documents and to allow citizens to help with the city, with the states, with the country,

171
0:15:14.000 --> 0:15:21.400
by really looking and making the government more transparent and more engaging.

172
0:15:21.400 --> 0:15:23.960
Open knowledge as well.

173
0:15:23.960 --> 0:15:32.520
So the Internet Archive is trying to create a collection of everything digital, making

174
0:15:32.520 --> 0:15:39.040
books digital, games, music, and there's a lot of movements around open knowledge as

175
0:15:39.040 --> 0:15:41.480
well.

176
0:15:41.480 --> 0:15:46.840
We have open hardware as well, which is essential.

177
0:15:46.840 --> 0:15:51.320
How open source and free software has influenced open education as well.

178
0:15:51.320 --> 0:15:58.800
We have OERs, which allows people to share contents around education.

179
0:15:58.800 --> 0:16:02.760
The open web, this is of course one of the main ones.

180
0:16:02.760 --> 0:16:06.960
We found on open web, it's very challenging.

181
0:16:06.960 --> 0:16:12.000
So the web has to be open, right?

182
0:16:12.000 --> 0:16:17.800
Linux of course, one of the main applications.

183
0:16:17.800 --> 0:16:20.560
Free software, we already saw this timeline.

184
0:16:20.560 --> 0:16:27.920
The importance of open access and open science and having reproducible science rights.

185
0:16:27.920 --> 0:16:39.520
And lastly, open data, the importance of open data, especially right now with AI, we have

186
0:16:39.520 --> 0:16:47.480
to have open data sets to help this and for people to collaborate.

187
0:16:47.480 --> 0:16:50.360
So this is about the past.

188
0:16:50.360 --> 0:16:54.640
Now we're going to jump to the future.

189
0:16:54.640 --> 0:17:00.320
And I'm just going to highlight a few projects which I'm really interested in.

190
0:17:00.320 --> 0:17:03.040
And I think this is the future of open source.

191
0:17:03.040 --> 0:17:06.160
Of course there are many other areas of interest.

192
0:17:06.160 --> 0:17:09.280
But we have the software build materials.

193
0:17:09.280 --> 0:17:17.400
This was especially due to the vulnerability that has been happening recently.

194
0:17:17.400 --> 0:17:24.480
And the White House in the U.S., they brought everyone together to discuss the role of open

195
0:17:24.480 --> 0:17:33.960
source in business and in government and everywhere and how it's important for us to have mechanisms

196
0:17:33.960 --> 0:17:36.840
that can protect those software.

197
0:17:36.840 --> 0:17:41.240
So one of them is software build materials.

198
0:17:41.240 --> 0:17:45.800
And this is being championed by the OPSSF and other organizations.

199
0:17:45.800 --> 0:17:47.240
This is really important.

200
0:17:47.240 --> 0:17:54.880
And basically, S-Bombs, they allow developers to track the dependencies and vulnerabilities

201
0:17:54.880 --> 0:18:00.300
in software packages to make sure that they are reliable.

202
0:18:00.300 --> 0:18:02.320
We also have SIGSTOR.

203
0:18:02.320 --> 0:18:07.080
And SIGSTOR is really important to make sure they have a package that is authentic.

204
0:18:07.080 --> 0:18:11.960
So it allows developers to assign those packages.

205
0:18:11.960 --> 0:18:18.320
And so nobody can tamper or compromise those packages.

206
0:18:18.320 --> 0:18:22.400
We finally have WebAssembly as well, which is coming along.

207
0:18:22.400 --> 0:18:24.600
So there's WebAssembly on the browser side.

208
0:18:24.600 --> 0:18:29.120
But there's also WebAssembly on the server side, which is gaining a lot of importance.

209
0:18:29.120 --> 0:18:36.760
And one of the reasons why WebAssembly is important is because of portability, security,

210
0:18:36.760 --> 0:18:39.320
and also performance.

211
0:18:39.320 --> 0:18:48.600
And WebAssembly has a huge potential to allow open source to grow.

212
0:18:48.600 --> 0:18:53.200
Something that I'm really keen to working with as well is confidential computing.

213
0:18:53.200 --> 0:18:59.600
We have a dev room that's happening here at Fosdom around confidential computing.

214
0:18:59.600 --> 0:19:06.240
And confidential computing is about encrypting data in use, in memory, in the CPU.

215
0:19:06.240 --> 0:19:11.120
So this will impact how we use the cloud today.

216
0:19:11.120 --> 0:19:15.080
When we use the clouds, there are a lot of security issues.

217
0:19:15.080 --> 0:19:21.040
And by using confidential computing, we allow this to be more secure.

218
0:19:21.040 --> 0:19:25.040
Finally, regarding AI, we have Bloom.

219
0:19:25.040 --> 0:19:29.040
So people here probably have heard of Shat's GPT.

220
0:19:29.040 --> 0:19:31.320
But that's not open source.

221
0:19:31.320 --> 0:19:38.040
And one of the issues of not being open source is that we don't allow researchers or anyone,

222
0:19:38.040 --> 0:19:45.680
any individual, to look into the algorithm or look into the models, the data sets.

223
0:19:45.680 --> 0:19:48.440
And Bloom is an attempt to do that.

224
0:19:48.440 --> 0:19:50.840
It's a European project, mostly.

225
0:19:50.840 --> 0:19:57.560
But it has researchers from all over the world as well attempting to create something, an

226
0:19:57.560 --> 0:20:00.120
open source AI.

227
0:20:00.120 --> 0:20:02.720
And this is really worth checking as well.

228
0:20:02.720 --> 0:20:05.440
And finally, we also have stable diffusion.

229
0:20:05.440 --> 0:20:15.080
This is a project, a deep learning project that you can enter a field description and

230
0:20:15.080 --> 0:20:17.280
it will generate an image for you.

231
0:20:17.280 --> 0:20:23.640
Again, the reason why it's important for you to have something that's open is because you

232
0:20:23.640 --> 0:20:28.340
want to see what are the models, what are the data sets, and research around that.

233
0:20:28.340 --> 0:20:31.440
And we want to have control over this.

234
0:20:31.440 --> 0:20:36.980
So this, for me, is the future of open source, some really interesting projects.

235
0:20:36.980 --> 0:20:41.800
And now I'm going to talk about the presence of open source.

236
0:20:41.800 --> 0:20:46.640
So this is the moment for you to celebrate open source.

237
0:20:46.640 --> 0:20:50.900
And I really want you to celebrate here at Fosden.

238
0:20:50.900 --> 0:20:56.220
So it's who here came alone?

239
0:20:56.220 --> 0:20:58.160
You don't have a colleague.

240
0:20:58.160 --> 0:20:59.160
Just raise your hands.

241
0:20:59.160 --> 0:21:02.160
Did you come with a friend or are you alone?

242
0:21:02.160 --> 0:21:05.080
Okay, we have quite a few hands.

243
0:21:05.080 --> 0:21:11.080
So go to someone by your side and ask, what's your open source journey?

244
0:21:11.080 --> 0:21:13.840
How did you get started with open source?

245
0:21:13.840 --> 0:21:16.720
Try to break the ice and share those stories.

246
0:21:16.720 --> 0:21:18.520
What are you interested in?

247
0:21:18.520 --> 0:21:21.680
What's the future of open source for you?

248
0:21:21.680 --> 0:21:24.560
What are the projects that you're working on?

249
0:21:24.560 --> 0:21:28.600
So celebrate here at Fosden together with your colleagues.

250
0:21:28.600 --> 0:21:33.520
I would also like to invite you to go to the state of Open Call.

251
0:21:33.520 --> 0:21:38.720
This is a conference that's happening right after Fosden in London.

252
0:21:38.720 --> 0:21:45.200
And there are 200 free tickets if you want to attend this conference.

253
0:21:45.200 --> 0:21:48.460
Usually the ticket is 199 pounds.

254
0:21:48.460 --> 0:21:55.600
But if you go to the table of Open UK here at Fosden, you can get free tickets.

255
0:21:55.600 --> 0:22:01.160
And the conference is going to be very close to Fosden and it's nearby.

256
0:22:01.160 --> 0:22:08.240
You can take the train and be there and just celebrate the 25 years of open source.

257
0:22:08.240 --> 0:22:12.520
And also celebrate the open source by creating your own personal timeline.

258
0:22:12.520 --> 0:22:20.040
You can afford this timeline and you can share your story.

259
0:22:20.040 --> 0:22:22.400
Also you can share the story of your projects.

260
0:22:22.400 --> 0:22:26.760
If you don't have an open source project, you can look at other projects and create

261
0:22:26.760 --> 0:22:31.120
a story about your projects.

262
0:22:31.120 --> 0:22:36.800
Organize a party at your organization, at your company, bring some cupcakes and share

263
0:22:36.800 --> 0:22:39.560
those photos with the OSI.

264
0:22:39.560 --> 0:22:43.120
You'll be sharing that with others as well.

265
0:22:43.120 --> 0:22:44.880
So you can share this.

266
0:22:44.880 --> 0:22:52.240
You can either tag the OSI on Twitter, but preferably on Macedon as well.

267
0:22:52.240 --> 0:23:00.720
So this one here is a nice picture of a celebration in Japan where they were celebrating the

268
0:23:00.720 --> 0:23:02.440
20 years of open source.

269
0:23:02.440 --> 0:23:11.240
So they just created, they have a cake from the tux and they just share the photos and

270
0:23:11.240 --> 0:23:15.000
the OSI share those again.

271
0:23:15.000 --> 0:23:23.680
And finally, I want to invite the OSI board of directors here for a special announcement

272
0:23:23.680 --> 0:23:26.560
to celebrate the 25 years of open source.

273
0:23:26.560 --> 0:23:29.880
And so thank you everyone and Juyos Universières.

274
0:23:29.880 --> 0:23:32.880
Thank you.

275
0:23:32.880 --> 0:23:43.480
Well, thank you so much, Nick, for sharing this opportunity.

276
0:23:43.480 --> 0:23:44.920
Hello, everyone.

277
0:23:44.920 --> 0:23:45.920
I'm Stefano Mafouli.

278
0:23:45.920 --> 0:23:49.040
I'm the executive director of the Open Source Initiative.

279
0:23:49.040 --> 0:23:57.880
And it's a privilege to be here to celebrate 25 years in February 1998.

280
0:23:57.880 --> 0:24:05.960
The Open Source Initiative has been focusing a lot in shaping with the open source definition.

281
0:24:05.960 --> 0:24:11.440
We've been shaping the conversations around technology for the past 20 years.

282
0:24:11.440 --> 0:24:16.000
And the definition itself, the community that we have created has influenced every technology

283
0:24:16.000 --> 0:24:22.920
that we have seen from the start of the internet, cryptography, content right management, the

284
0:24:22.920 --> 0:24:28.800
software patents debate, we've been at the center of everything that happened in technology

285
0:24:28.800 --> 0:24:29.960
in our society.

286
0:24:29.960 --> 0:24:34.240
But this is not about only talking about the past.

287
0:24:34.240 --> 0:24:37.760
We are the stewards of the open source definition.

288
0:24:37.760 --> 0:24:41.360
As an organization, we maintain it for the community.

289
0:24:41.360 --> 0:24:46.560
And the community itself changes all the time.

290
0:24:46.560 --> 0:24:50.000
The technology also changes.

291
0:24:50.000 --> 0:24:54.360
And we have to pay attention to these changes in order to adapt.

292
0:24:54.360 --> 0:25:04.200
In the past year, the organization has been looking at AI and how the new technology is

293
0:25:04.200 --> 0:25:08.440
actually looking different from what we've seen before.

294
0:25:08.440 --> 0:25:15.840
Today, I mean, this week and the next week, we're going to have a few announcements.

295
0:25:15.840 --> 0:25:22.720
We're going to publish a report of their findings of the deep dive on AI that we've done last

296
0:25:22.720 --> 0:25:31.080
year, when we have interviewed experts in many different fields from academia, practitioners

297
0:25:31.080 --> 0:25:42.320
of AI, developers, hackers, corporations doing artificial intelligence, civil society, politicians,

298
0:25:42.320 --> 0:25:43.320
policymakers.

299
0:25:43.320 --> 0:25:48.720
And we have collected all the thoughts, all the findings into one document that you can

300
0:25:48.720 --> 0:25:49.720
look at.

301
0:25:49.720 --> 0:25:55.800
And I can share with you today just the very, the most important things that I've learned

302
0:25:55.800 --> 0:25:57.160
from this experience.

303
0:25:57.160 --> 0:26:05.600
One is that artificial intelligence and AI systems, machine learning, reinforcement learning,

304
0:26:05.600 --> 0:26:09.920
all these new modern systems, they require a huge amount of data.

305
0:26:09.920 --> 0:26:18.000
And that is interesting to me because it clashes a lot with the thoughts that we have already

306
0:26:18.000 --> 0:26:24.960
had with privacy, for example, collecting large amounts of data requires, to some extent,

307
0:26:24.960 --> 0:26:31.360
making compromises about privacy and rights of the authors, like the concept of copyright

308
0:26:31.360 --> 0:26:37.840
that we always thought of, something that I've created, I have rights on.

309
0:26:37.840 --> 0:26:43.880
There is a new right in town that is also being regulated.

310
0:26:43.880 --> 0:26:47.960
We have the right to data mining, which is fairly new.

311
0:26:47.960 --> 0:26:54.320
And we have to try to find the strike a balance between these new rights, personal rights,

312
0:26:54.320 --> 0:26:57.760
authors' rights, and availability of data.

313
0:26:57.760 --> 0:27:02.960
Because the other side of the spectrum is that large amounts of data can be amassed

314
0:27:02.960 --> 0:27:05.600
with large amounts of money and resources.

315
0:27:05.600 --> 0:27:11.400
So hackers may not have the availability of creating suitable AI systems if we put too

316
0:27:11.400 --> 0:27:14.680
many restrictions on data mining.

317
0:27:14.680 --> 0:27:19.800
That's one of the aspects of, that is going to be highlighted in the report.

318
0:27:19.800 --> 0:27:28.000
The second one is that the legal systems, or actually policymakers, are extremely interested

319
0:27:28.000 --> 0:27:30.840
in regulating this new field.

320
0:27:30.840 --> 0:27:38.760
Because it comes with, it's extremely powerful, the systems we've seen running are very powerful

321
0:27:38.760 --> 0:27:45.320
and they can create damage, therefore policymakers are paying attention and they want to regulate

322
0:27:45.320 --> 0:27:46.640
it.

323
0:27:46.640 --> 0:27:51.880
We need to find a balance between having too much regulation and allowing innovation.

324
0:27:51.880 --> 0:27:57.440
And the community needs to pay attention to this as it's happening.

325
0:27:57.440 --> 0:28:10.360
And the third and last piece in this very tip of the iceberg is that the practitioners

326
0:28:10.360 --> 0:28:19.440
of AI, developers of AI systems, researchers, professors, the academia levels, are very

327
0:28:19.440 --> 0:28:25.280
aware of the ethical aspects, the use of AI systems.

328
0:28:25.280 --> 0:28:30.400
They are aware of the fact that they can be misused and they can create really bad damages

329
0:28:30.400 --> 0:28:32.160
to people.

330
0:28:32.160 --> 0:28:38.840
And therefore they're thinking very hard about regulating the use of systems.

331
0:28:38.840 --> 0:28:45.040
This is something that the open source community has never really paid attention to, has always

332
0:28:45.040 --> 0:28:49.440
allowed for very freely use of software.

333
0:28:49.440 --> 0:28:54.280
It's part of the open source definition, part of the free software definition, that you

334
0:28:54.280 --> 0:29:01.360
cannot stop, you cannot regulate the use.

335
0:29:01.360 --> 0:29:07.600
But AI practitioners seem to be quite interested into doing just the opposite.

336
0:29:07.600 --> 0:29:13.560
So we have to help them and talk to them a lot to understand their needs and to find

337
0:29:13.560 --> 0:29:20.240
with them social norms, social rules that allow for collaboration, that limit the amount

338
0:29:20.240 --> 0:29:25.520
of damages that AI systems can do and at the same time allow for the collaboration to happen

339
0:29:25.520 --> 0:29:29.680
in a frictionless and permissionless way.

340
0:29:29.680 --> 0:29:37.320
So with that said, I really recommend you to follow deepdive.opensource.org, go and

341
0:29:37.320 --> 0:29:43.960
listen to the podcasts if you have not heard them already, listen to them.

342
0:29:43.960 --> 0:29:52.120
And we have also the report coming up so you will be notified when it comes out.

343
0:29:52.120 --> 0:29:54.720
We have two more announcements to make.

344
0:29:54.720 --> 0:30:03.960
One we will, we are reviewing how, we are renewing the process that reviews the licenses

345
0:30:03.960 --> 0:30:10.320
and we're going to have a conversation in the legal dev room later today at one o'clock.

346
0:30:10.320 --> 0:30:17.320
And we also have an announcement to make for which Deb, our director of policy, will talk

347
0:30:17.320 --> 0:30:18.480
more about.

348
0:30:18.480 --> 0:30:19.480
Thank you.

349
0:30:19.480 --> 0:30:20.480
Thank you very much.

350
0:30:20.480 --> 0:30:21.480
Thanks again, Nick.

351
0:30:21.480 --> 0:30:27.600
I'm going to do a three-minute announcement.

352
0:30:27.600 --> 0:30:28.840
So I'm Deb Bryant.

353
0:30:28.840 --> 0:30:34.520
I'm policy director for the U.S. and I have also been involved with the United Nations

354
0:30:34.520 --> 0:30:40.020
over the last couple of years, helping them as they were developing a registry for digital

355
0:30:40.020 --> 0:30:41.020
public goods.

356
0:30:41.020 --> 0:30:42.800
Well, I'm very excited.

357
0:30:42.800 --> 0:30:49.500
You're the first to know, so you can socialize this, that OSI is joining as an official member

358
0:30:49.500 --> 0:30:51.720
of the Digital Public Goods Alliance.

359
0:30:51.720 --> 0:30:59.400
The DTBA is the initiative that has created a strategy to support the U.N. sustainable

360
0:30:59.400 --> 0:31:04.620
goals through the use of open source software and open infrastructure.

361
0:31:04.620 --> 0:31:10.160
If you're around tomorrow, there's a dev room that the Foundation for Public Code and the

362
0:31:10.160 --> 0:31:13.120
Digital Public Goods Alliance are co-hosting.

363
0:31:13.120 --> 0:31:15.760
They also have a stand here so you can hear more about it.

364
0:31:15.760 --> 0:31:20.040
But as a public charity, we think it's important for OSI to support those goals.

365
0:31:20.040 --> 0:31:26.520
We're very excited that there's a recognition of the strong ingredient of open source and

366
0:31:26.520 --> 0:31:28.560
creating a more equitable world.

367
0:31:28.560 --> 0:31:30.360
So thanks for letting us share that here.

368
0:31:30.360 --> 0:31:32.680
And I'm going to hand it back to Nick to wrap up the session.

369
0:31:32.680 --> 0:31:33.680
Thanks, everybody.

370
0:31:33.680 --> 0:31:34.680
All right.

371
0:31:34.680 --> 0:31:45.680
And to conclude, every celebration, every birthday needs sweets and desserts.

372
0:31:45.680 --> 0:31:57.120
So we have a box here of Belgian chocolates, of course.

373
0:31:57.120 --> 0:31:58.640
And stickers.

374
0:31:58.640 --> 0:32:00.660
There are some special stickers from the OSI.

375
0:32:00.660 --> 0:32:04.520
So please pass it around and enjoy it.

376
0:32:04.520 --> 0:32:05.520
Thank you.

377
0:32:05.520 --> 0:32:34.740
Thank you very much All through the all!
