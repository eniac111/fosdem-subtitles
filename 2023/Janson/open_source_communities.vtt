WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.820
I'm going to talk today about when I wrote the talk, I said open source collaboration,

00:12.820 --> 00:17.960
but I think open collaboration more in general is maybe more appropriate.

00:17.960 --> 00:25.260
I think we have as developers, it doesn't allow me to touch code anymore, but you have

00:25.260 --> 00:31.320
an amazing potential to make the world a better place.

00:31.320 --> 00:39.920
Today I'd like to talk about first of all, why open source is eating the world.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.200
I want to start with a bit of my personal journey that hopefully makes you understand

00:44.200 --> 00:50.520
sort of the background that I'm coming from.

00:50.520 --> 00:58.960
I started about 15 years ago in open source and I had a lot more hair and I guess at the

00:58.960 --> 01:04.600
cost of aging myself, how many people know something called Apache Cocoon?

01:04.600 --> 01:06.000
Exactly.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.320
I figured.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.200
Exactly.

01:11.200 --> 01:18.840
I started in open source really because it was fun, because it was, I gotta say, also

01:18.840 --> 01:21.840
a way for me to accelerate my career.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.080
The opportunity to collaborate on the left side, you got my best friend who still is

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
my best friend.

01:28.080 --> 01:35.640
I made some of my best friendships in open source, but the day that I got my Apache email

01:35.640 --> 01:38.600
address, I still remember it.

01:38.600 --> 01:46.800
I was so proud about being in the, in between so many smart guys, effectively much smarter

01:46.800 --> 01:50.680
than me because I've been pretty much mainly a release manager at that time.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.520
I never really wrote super hard code.

01:53.520 --> 02:01.920
That's where I started, really as a personal motivator.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.520
Then I moved into, I had the luck to move to Holland.

02:05.520 --> 02:14.520
Let's say in Italy, didn't really have such a lively technology ecosystem in 2006.

02:14.520 --> 02:20.680
Then I had the luck of starting to get paid to do my open source work, whether it was

02:20.680 --> 02:29.800
community open source, building SDKs, whether it is actually as part of my day job, being

02:29.800 --> 02:36.360
able to be first a developer, then a product manager for the developer platform.

02:36.360 --> 02:42.400
Not sure what I'm doing up there, but I guess clearly I was having a lot of fun in Munich

02:42.400 --> 02:46.640
or thereabouts.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.760
Then I moved to the US.

02:47.760 --> 02:53.760
I never really grew up with the American dream.

02:53.760 --> 03:01.360
I just say that, but both for work and for personal reasons, I moved to the United States

03:01.360 --> 03:08.480
and I entered this magic world of foundations.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.080
A foundation in a pretty conservative and regulated industry.

03:12.080 --> 03:16.720
This was 2015 when I got called to run, what at the time was called the Symphony Software

03:16.720 --> 03:22.720
Foundation and now it's Finos, the FinTech open source foundation.

03:22.720 --> 03:31.920
I tried to take the Apache way, my open source upbringing and throw it at banks.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.320
It didn't really stick.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.960
I started saying, hey, if it doesn't happen on the list, it doesn't happen.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.160
You guys should collaborate openly.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
It didn't work.

03:44.160 --> 03:51.560
I really had to switch gears and start talking to them about what was the value for them

03:51.560 --> 03:55.720
to collaborate in the open.

03:55.720 --> 04:02.400
Not undermining the principles and the transparency and the governance of open source, but I found

04:02.400 --> 04:08.720
much more success in bringing all different constituents together, whether it is financial

04:08.720 --> 04:15.200
institutions, whether it is technology vendors, whether it is individual contributors, of

04:15.200 --> 04:19.320
course, that make still the largest part of our community.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.760
I think very interesting regulators.

04:22.760 --> 04:28.040
I think a theme that you're going to hear quite recurring during the presentation.

04:28.040 --> 04:37.200
There is something there in having active public sector collaboration in industries,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.080
in open source projects.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.480
There's still a long way to go.

04:42.480 --> 04:47.520
I wouldn't say that banks are first class citizens of the open source community, but

04:47.520 --> 04:54.640
we were able to make some of the largest firms in the US and in Europe, and in the UK, I

04:54.640 --> 04:58.480
guess, extended Europe, collaborate.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.760
That's I think the beginning of something quite interesting because they have some pretty

05:02.760 --> 05:09.160
powerful technology that they're now making available and trying to be good citizens to

05:09.160 --> 05:14.880
maintain, not just dump and run.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.560
And then it got personal.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.680
Probably seen on my desktop the picture of my kid.

05:20.680 --> 05:29.600
Leonardo, his special needs kid, pretty heavily fragile as a kid.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.320
When I started seeing the... Yeah, he was born like a lion.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.440
No, this disability.

05:37.440 --> 05:44.320
I started seeing how open source, again, really this is close to my heart.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.440
There are plenty of efforts out there that are trying to use either open data or open

05:49.440 --> 05:56.360
source truly open collaboration approach to solve things that, for which there's no

05:56.360 --> 05:58.640
commercial liability.

05:58.640 --> 06:08.080
Big pharma is much more encouraged to work on cancer, vaccines, things that have a massive

06:08.080 --> 06:15.440
applicability and therefore massive commercial potential rather than solving very rare genetic

06:15.440 --> 06:24.040
diseases where you have 10 people in the world having that specific gene that is a mutation.

06:24.040 --> 06:31.520
And so open treatment is under the Linux condition, open single nucleotide polymorphism.

06:31.520 --> 06:40.520
I'm not really a biologist or doctor, but you see the power of bringing together data

06:40.520 --> 06:47.080
from all around the world to make something out of where there's no really commercial

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
drive.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.320
There's no drive for innovation.

06:52.320 --> 07:01.880
And so all of this to say that I find open source itself to be the positive sum game

07:01.880 --> 07:10.440
for which whether you are corporate, whether you are a government, whether you are an individual,

07:10.440 --> 07:15.520
we can find ways to engage these people.

07:15.520 --> 07:23.680
And I know that there's a lot of polarization today and I hope, nowadays, whether it is

07:23.680 --> 07:30.440
individual versus big tech, whether it's Europe versus the US or China, but I do think without

07:30.440 --> 07:37.560
being naive that open source actually can be a way for everyone to collaborate and deliver

07:37.560 --> 07:41.840
not just technology innovation but social value.

07:41.840 --> 07:48.200
So I want to, before we go into sort of what are the challenges, I think it's important

07:48.200 --> 07:53.680
to talk and sort of understand how some of the most successful projects, at least in

07:53.680 --> 07:55.680
my experience, came about.

07:55.680 --> 08:03.080
I mean, I'm sure you're all pretty familiar with a guy called Linus Torbald, so I'm not

08:03.080 --> 08:09.240
going to go into Linux as a pretty obvious example of a project that was individually

08:09.240 --> 08:13.280
started or individually led at the beginning.

08:13.280 --> 08:19.120
But more recently, again, more in the world of finance, one example that has been pretty

08:19.120 --> 08:26.160
interesting to me of a project that started by an individual out of really coding, maybe

08:26.160 --> 08:33.800
not certainly a garage, but during the pandemic in lockdown, it's a software called OpenBB.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.920
It used to be called Gainstunk terminal.

08:36.920 --> 08:46.080
If you're familiar with the GameStop frenzy two years ago where the community started

08:46.080 --> 08:54.760
betting against Wall Street and created a pretty interesting basically growth of a stock

08:54.760 --> 09:02.600
that really didn't GameStop, didn't really have a lot more value, but it was an example

09:02.600 --> 09:15.640
of a movement that was really trying to democratize access to a very elitist and very wealthy

09:15.640 --> 09:16.640
part of the industry.

09:16.640 --> 09:25.080
And so one guy overnight built sort of a replacement Bloomberg terminal.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.080
For those of you who are not familiar with Bloomberg terminals, what people use in Wall

09:29.080 --> 09:39.520
Street is a very closed, very heavily proprietary terminal, literally a thing, a box that are

09:39.520 --> 09:43.200
used by traders to research and trade.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.720
And so someone went out there and built an actual terminal.

09:47.720 --> 09:55.280
Turns out that normally when you pair open source with a cause, you really get a potential

09:55.280 --> 09:59.280
amazing exponential growth, but of course timing has to be right.

09:59.280 --> 10:05.760
This was done when at the very moment that the whole world of retail investors was betting

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
against Wall Street.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.640
And of course it's not just about the code.

10:10.640 --> 10:18.120
It was lucky DDA, which I happen to be a friend of, was able to put it on Acorn News.

10:18.120 --> 10:22.160
It went viral on Acorn News, went number one.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.520
And so it was off the races.

10:23.520 --> 10:29.120
It started getting contributions, it's now gotten funding, and it rebranded from, again,

10:29.120 --> 10:32.080
gainstump terminal to OpenBB.

10:32.080 --> 10:37.240
So there's a lot of power when you are able to pair open source with an actual social

10:37.240 --> 10:44.480
cause or an individual cause.

10:44.480 --> 10:50.160
Now we're very familiar, I think, with corporate led open source projects.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.640
We're getting more and more common.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.320
There are two examples here.

10:57.320 --> 11:05.360
As I said, I never really grew up with the American dream, but it has to be said that

11:05.360 --> 11:15.880
some contributions from big tech like Kubernetes or PyTorch have certainly created opportunities

11:15.880 --> 11:16.880
out there.

11:16.880 --> 11:22.720
And of course this is not because of charity, let's be clear.

11:22.720 --> 11:30.120
While us coming from the open source community have an aspect of conscience, these large

11:30.120 --> 11:36.520
corporations largely do open source because they see a potential down the line, whether

11:36.520 --> 11:39.000
it is commoditizing a competitor.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.920
If you've never seen the Kubernetes documentary, they actually have a documentary.

11:45.920 --> 11:50.560
Which one day I'll be so cool that I have a documentary about my project.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.840
But Google said it out loud.

11:54.840 --> 12:01.000
Incrementalism step by step wasn't going to get them to catch up with Amazon on the

12:01.000 --> 12:02.720
cloud front.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.000
And so the open source Kubernetes.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.880
We now have about 21 trillion investment globally, about 1 trillion in Europe.

12:15.880 --> 12:21.080
And Kubernetes is one of the most sought after skills out there.

12:21.080 --> 12:27.680
And again, this doesn't mean that the motives originally were about the spirit of open source,

12:27.680 --> 12:30.920
but certainly it has created opportunity.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.720
Same for PyTorch.

12:32.720 --> 12:40.240
Some of the main advancements out there, we can talk about TensorFlow, but really AI

12:40.240 --> 12:49.080
has certainly benefited from the open sourcing and more recently the introduction of open

12:49.080 --> 12:53.480
governance around some of these projects.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.480
But of course, as I said, open governance, you must play by the rules.

12:57.480 --> 13:03.080
And I know that we all have slightly different ideas what the rules should be, but certainly

13:03.080 --> 13:08.000
a good starting point is to use an OSI approved license.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.800
And ideally, be in any foundation where you can bring all the different parties together

13:14.800 --> 13:20.000
and be a neutral environment.

13:20.000 --> 13:29.360
And then we have plenty of examples of non-profit led open source, whether it is projects from

13:29.360 --> 13:37.040
the Linux Foundation or more from a 501c3-type charity like, for example, Mojalup, the works

13:37.040 --> 13:40.400
around financial inclusion.

13:40.400 --> 13:48.000
We have seen, especially in the last few years, how open source not always super successfully.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.840
Because, for example, I left Public Health was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic

13:55.840 --> 14:00.840
to have open source COVID tracking apps.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.040
And it's been used in some governments.

14:04.040 --> 14:11.560
But as a US resident, I still have my paper vaccine card like when I was in the 80s.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.920
So it hasn't really been as ubiquitous as we wanted to be.

14:15.920 --> 14:24.120
But certainly the attempt was correct, that we are all in a major global crisis and open

14:24.120 --> 14:27.120
source can help.

14:27.120 --> 14:32.880
A great example is OpenSSF.

14:32.880 --> 14:40.640
Actually, while I tend to forget that OpenSSF was created two months before log for shell,

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
not after.

14:41.640 --> 14:48.680
Although the Linux Foundation was pretty well positioned to help and corral a response,

14:48.680 --> 14:51.200
at least from the US government.

14:51.200 --> 14:57.360
We had several meetings at the White House, acting really as a sort of convening power

14:57.360 --> 15:00.560
also for the large technology companies.

15:00.560 --> 15:11.080
And I hope we can work together on a global standard here because we're all at risk based

15:11.080 --> 15:15.320
on open source sustainability, really.

15:15.320 --> 15:23.400
And then finally, as I said, non-profit, when you talk about financial inclusion or other

15:23.400 --> 15:31.000
causes, you can attract also private funding, charity funding, the Mojo Lopez largely funded

15:31.000 --> 15:36.520
also by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

15:36.520 --> 15:42.800
And so what is preventing us to make an even bigger impact?

15:42.800 --> 15:48.480
I think there's a few reasons.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.680
One I just hinted to, it's open source sustainability.

15:50.680 --> 16:03.880
I think most of you have probably seen that comic about how often and in some cases how

16:03.880 --> 16:12.080
little we know about how the modern infrastructure sometimes is relying on, again, the amazing

16:12.080 --> 16:16.400
work of some random guy in the brass kit says that.

16:16.400 --> 16:27.960
I know many of you can relate to sometimes how unthankful the internet can be or the

16:27.960 --> 16:32.720
technology community can be when you are doing amazing work and maintaining a library that

16:32.720 --> 16:42.160
then turns out large corporations, governments, and technology companies rely on every day.

16:42.160 --> 16:49.960
And so why else, of course, log for shell, solar winds, and all the attacks that we've

16:49.960 --> 16:54.400
seen in the last few years have raised the profile and created organizations like Open

16:54.400 --> 16:59.760
SSS to really start addressing not only security but sustainability.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.520
This remains a big problem.

17:03.520 --> 17:09.880
Also because of lack or uneven funding across the world.

17:09.880 --> 17:16.640
As I said, I had the luck finally in my career to start being paid to do open source.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.200
And it's a beautiful thing.

17:19.200 --> 17:26.800
I never had to really struggle to do what I love so much doing.

17:26.800 --> 17:31.080
And a little caveat here.

17:31.080 --> 17:36.360
I don't come from a rich family, but they were able to make me study.

17:36.360 --> 17:47.080
And I think in Europe it's to an extent easier to have some of those basic rights.

17:47.080 --> 17:53.400
But I never, never forget that it's a privilege to be able to work in open source.

17:53.400 --> 17:58.620
I used to start growing up, I used to say, look, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't started

17:58.620 --> 18:05.480
contributing to open source with that picture with long hair.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.440
But it's because I had time to do it.

18:07.440 --> 18:18.720
There are simply people and large slices of society that don't have time or don't have

18:18.720 --> 18:23.240
the opportunity to be able to start contributing because they have to do three jobs to get

18:23.240 --> 18:25.520
to the end of the month.

18:25.520 --> 18:30.000
And so open source sustainability is a major issue.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.280
And I think we need to continue addressing it.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.400
And of course, a little touch on open washing.

18:37.400 --> 18:43.800
It is very much still a thing, especially in less mature industries.

18:43.800 --> 18:51.800
It's very easy and very cool to jump on the open bandwagon without truly understanding

18:51.800 --> 19:02.760
or actually either maliciously, meaning trying to exploit the marketing value of open source,

19:02.760 --> 19:09.760
or inadvertently not understanding that, yeah, you have to contribute back if you want to

19:09.760 --> 19:11.760
ensure a live ecosystem.

19:11.760 --> 19:16.000
And if you can do software as a corporate world, you can fund open source.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.640
You can pay your developers to work in the open.

19:20.640 --> 19:27.400
But I do think that the main issue is fragmentation, actually.

19:27.400 --> 19:37.720
This is a report that Linux Foundation Research led together with other foundations like Eclipse,

19:37.720 --> 19:42.240
Live Networking and Linux Foundation Europe.

19:42.240 --> 19:47.440
It's about really trying to understand what are the main challenges that prevent us from

19:47.440 --> 19:56.840
even further getting together and addressing some of the most pressing issues out there.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.360
This is one that is near and dear to my heart, especially as we're here in Brussels.

20:01.360 --> 20:09.920
And we recently started the Linux Foundation Europe in the understanding that there's a

20:09.920 --> 20:19.640
lot of potential to help Europe, European technology, European values, start in Europe

20:19.640 --> 20:24.480
but really go global through the Linux Foundation platform.

20:24.480 --> 20:29.400
And of course, it is all over the world.

20:29.400 --> 20:39.400
There's clearly a desire and a set of statements to use open source for advancing digital sovereignty,

20:39.400 --> 20:40.960
creating the digital commons.

20:40.960 --> 20:50.600
But it seems very much to me that there hasn't yet been a true set of actions that are very

20:50.600 --> 20:57.320
concrete in driving towards that vision.

20:57.320 --> 21:04.280
It's very much promoted in principle, but sometimes even well-intentioned regulations.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.520
I think if you were here yesterday, there's been a lot of conversations around the Cyber

21:07.520 --> 21:15.720
Resiliency Act and what the potential unintended consequences on open source can be and the

21:15.720 --> 21:20.880
burden they might create on maintainers, on foundations, while again, in principle, the

21:20.880 --> 21:29.720
goal was to try to address sustainability and try to address security and put some of

21:29.720 --> 21:32.640
the burden on the commercial companies.

21:32.640 --> 21:38.760
To me, it's fairly correct.

21:38.760 --> 21:48.240
And so you always end up with great statements, but not so much of a aligned action.

21:48.240 --> 21:55.480
And you have to say, OSPOs, the European Commission is an OSPO now, two days ago the Dutch government

21:55.480 --> 21:57.360
announced the creation of an OSPO.

21:57.360 --> 22:02.000
They are sort of really starting to spring out there and I think it's a construct that

22:02.000 --> 22:03.640
is going to help.

22:03.640 --> 22:10.200
But I think, again, for what I've learned from finance, you need a bottoms up and a

22:10.200 --> 22:19.560
top down approach here.

22:19.560 --> 22:24.040
So where do we go from here?

22:24.040 --> 22:27.800
If we want to make an ever bigger impact.

22:27.800 --> 22:34.000
Actually, I'm missing a slide.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.040
Sorry guys.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.960
Oh well.

22:41.960 --> 22:47.480
I guess I lost it.

22:47.480 --> 22:52.120
I think there is a couple of things that we need to look forward to.

22:52.120 --> 23:00.840
From understanding that open source is not the battlefield.

23:00.840 --> 23:07.200
We can compete on the commercial side of the house.

23:07.200 --> 23:16.520
We can compete on what is truly differentiating.

23:16.520 --> 23:23.640
But it's not the open source community where this battle should happen.

23:23.640 --> 23:31.920
Digital sovereignty doesn't mean building borders around open source.

23:31.920 --> 23:41.880
And indeed, that is also what's coming out the fragmentation report.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.680
Transparent open source developments are the best antidote for techno-nationalism.

23:45.680 --> 23:56.720
This is something that, again, despite we know there are tensions all over.

23:56.720 --> 23:57.720
Open source should be a bridge.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.640
It shouldn't be another way to divide us.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.920
And there are plenty of areas where we can collaborate.

24:04.920 --> 24:09.960
Whether it is open source infrastructure.

24:09.960 --> 24:16.480
Whether it is open source security.

24:16.480 --> 24:24.280
Whether it is intellectual property that remains a pretty regional sort of concern.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.280
Whether it is even broader goals.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.760
And that's where I'm going to go in the next slide.

24:30.760 --> 24:36.080
And I want to say we are asked as foundations to work better together.

24:36.080 --> 24:42.800
There are plenty of educational initiatives out there that we have helped the government.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.760
We have the TUDA group at the Linux Foundation.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.320
But there's OSPO++ who works a lot with the public sector.

24:48.320 --> 24:52.360
There is the OSPO Zone and OSPO Alliance from the Eclipse Foundation.

24:52.360 --> 24:58.680
If there's one objective that I have in my new tenure here in Linux Foundation Europe

24:58.680 --> 25:02.760
is really to bring not only governments but really start from foundation.

25:02.760 --> 25:14.240
This is something that we are being asked very much loudly by the ecosystem.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.040
And I realize this is in the U.S. up there.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.720
But we do have travel funding.

25:19.720 --> 25:27.640
But we are starting to also organize conferences and moments where we're focused on really

25:27.640 --> 25:31.720
educating the government into how they can help.

25:31.720 --> 25:36.600
Not just in words, not just in sort of grants that stop at research level, but really in

25:36.600 --> 25:41.880
active participation in open source projects.

25:41.880 --> 25:48.560
And as I said, part of the issue here is fragmentation.

25:48.560 --> 25:57.320
I know for a fact even within the Linux Foundation we create five or six projects every day, sorry

25:57.320 --> 26:00.640
every day, every quarter.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.480
There are thousands of projects created in GitHub every month.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.200
If not probably thousands.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.640
There's an underestimation.

26:10.640 --> 26:17.320
And so it behooves us and that's again what comes out from the fragmentation report to

26:17.320 --> 26:20.520
really do more to align projects.

26:20.520 --> 26:25.160
And I think I want to applaud if you guys were here yesterday morning the open source

26:25.160 --> 26:31.920
initiative announced their partnership with the Digital Public Goods Alliance, which is

26:31.920 --> 26:37.040
very much aligned to the U.N. sustainable goals.

26:37.040 --> 26:44.440
And at the Linux Foundation we're also trying to align our initiatives, our projects.

26:44.440 --> 26:50.800
Again we have, I don't know what's the current count of projects, over a thousand projects

26:50.800 --> 26:51.800
in the Linux Foundation.

26:51.800 --> 27:04.560
And I have no idea how many can address climate, can address water prices, can address energy.

27:04.560 --> 27:10.600
What I know is that Europe has, many of these projects are based in Europe.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.680
OAS Climate has a large presence in Europe.

27:14.680 --> 27:22.160
Agstack for agriculture and agtech and of course, elephant energy.

27:22.160 --> 27:32.800
Those of you who know elephant energy know that the leader recently passed away, Shirley

27:32.800 --> 27:34.000
Goodman.

27:34.000 --> 27:42.640
She was a great activist and very much seen Europe as a springboard for global climate

27:42.640 --> 27:44.480
action.

27:44.480 --> 27:49.680
And so you can certainly expect from us a much stronger alignment towards sustainability.

27:49.680 --> 27:56.080
In fact, again unfortunately the CFP closes today, so if you're quick you can probably

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
still sneak it in.

27:57.080 --> 28:04.320
But we are adding another track to our open source summit, which is sustainability.

28:04.320 --> 28:10.560
Again in the spirit of trying to at least have our house in Hordur and then hopefully

28:10.560 --> 28:19.600
are collaborating more broadly on the 17 silver high value goals.

28:19.600 --> 28:28.400
And then I think another way to go beyond standard, beyond this fragmentation is really,

28:28.400 --> 28:36.240
and I'm sure again this is not a new comic strip.

28:36.240 --> 28:43.680
I've taken part in standards, I've taken part in open source projects over time and hopefully

28:43.680 --> 28:49.200
I don't offend anyone here, but I think open source is better.

28:49.200 --> 28:58.040
I mean it's just more apt to incremental progress.

28:58.040 --> 29:06.200
You can always fork later if you don't agree, but ultimately it allows to build on an existing

29:06.200 --> 29:16.040
concrete piece of code rather than coming up with yet another top down 15th standard

29:16.040 --> 29:19.760
whereby 14 do exist.

29:19.760 --> 29:26.640
I think this is something that also impacts how we collaborate as individuals.

29:26.640 --> 29:33.640
One hand, look, one of the things that came out of the fragmentation report is that fragmentation

29:33.640 --> 29:34.920
is a double S word.

29:34.920 --> 29:43.240
Sure we want consolidation, but on the other hand there is value in the distributed mode

29:43.240 --> 29:51.080
of open source development whereby we want to allow multiple options to solve the same

29:51.080 --> 29:59.240
problem, and then open source Darwinism is going to run its course.

29:59.240 --> 30:04.880
I do also think that it beholds us as developers, I guess, I don't know if I can call myself

30:04.880 --> 30:11.880
a developer anymore, to try harder, to try harder not to reinvent the wheel.

30:11.880 --> 30:21.320
Again I keep aging myself, but I used to be the maiden guy before going into the foundation

30:21.320 --> 30:25.160
world and I got so much crap from the ant guys.

30:25.160 --> 30:30.640
Dude, what are you doing, this is not what you should be, it's very polarizing.

30:30.640 --> 30:36.440
I'm like yeah sure, we know it's not perfect, but how about we try to consolidate and improve

30:36.440 --> 30:41.480
rather than creating yet another framework or yet another library.

30:41.480 --> 30:50.560
Again, sometimes there's perfectly valuable reasons to do so.

30:50.560 --> 30:54.560
How do we bring it all together?

30:54.560 --> 31:01.840
This is a very similar slide to the one that we've seen before on finance and the lesson

31:01.840 --> 31:08.160
that I've learned is that it's important to start with why.

31:08.160 --> 31:16.200
By why I mean not only the conscience aspect of open source, but we all I think if we're

31:16.200 --> 31:24.960
here are familiar with, are driven by, but if we want I think to truly make an even bigger

31:24.960 --> 31:31.080
impact and a more focused impact on whether it is those major social goals and sustainability

31:31.080 --> 31:38.840
development goals, whether it is starting to change an industry, finance, healthcare

31:38.840 --> 31:44.640
is one that of course is near and dear to my heart and due to many reasons it's still

31:44.640 --> 31:53.000
very close, sometimes they hide behind the regulated nature to enact change, but the

31:53.000 --> 31:58.160
reality is that as we've seen for banks this is actually possible.

31:58.160 --> 32:06.280
Whether it is to make the government understand what they should be practically doing in an

32:06.280 --> 32:18.280
open source project to advance a certain policy, there's so much at least in the EU talk about

32:18.280 --> 32:25.080
open source and how open source can advance European small and medium businesses and innovation

32:25.080 --> 32:31.320
and that really does need to be translated into action.

32:31.320 --> 32:38.400
So I think independent organizations like foundations, or just the Linux Foundation,

32:38.400 --> 32:44.880
any foundation out there and hopefully better collaborating with each other, is a way to

32:44.880 --> 32:48.080
bring all these different actors together.

32:48.080 --> 32:54.280
Still with the principles of open source, but I think if we lead with that we're going

32:54.280 --> 33:00.960
to lose some people on the way, we're going to lose the people that really are there for

33:00.960 --> 33:13.320
the money or for a cause or unfortunately not everyone has this natural driver to collaborate

33:13.320 --> 33:20.760
and so you always need to try and sell it, I know it's a dirty word to an extent, but

33:20.760 --> 33:26.360
sell the reasons and the value why people would want to participate in open source and

33:26.360 --> 33:35.160
to me bringing everyone together under common governance is really the way forward.

33:35.160 --> 33:43.200
And so, about to wrap, what can we do, can you do practically to help?

33:43.200 --> 33:48.880
I think from our side there is much more work in being organized and collaborate and aligned

33:48.880 --> 33:52.640
to common goals on the foundation's side.

33:52.640 --> 34:05.240
But I think if anyone here is from the public sector and the EU or listening online, open

34:05.240 --> 34:10.240
source can be the vehicle to drive policy goals.

34:10.240 --> 34:19.560
I mean there's so much that we can bridge if we start with open governance and I think

34:19.560 --> 34:26.000
we're not going to be there probably this year or even next year, but I see a moment

34:26.000 --> 34:32.240
in which like I've seen with banks we can involve or why not?

34:32.240 --> 34:39.440
The government should be able to start open source projects that contextually drive these

34:39.440 --> 34:45.160
big policy goals whether it is DNA, DSA, the cyber resiliency act, the interoperability

34:45.160 --> 34:51.120
act, there's so much out there that Europe in fact is leading.

34:51.120 --> 35:01.200
I think about GDPR, I live in California and thanks to GDPR we have CCPA which is the most

35:01.200 --> 35:14.440
similar sort of data privacy protection in another wise pretty wild landscape and at

35:14.440 --> 35:20.000
the level of consumer protection that's really, you know, it's in the standard setting from

35:20.000 --> 35:26.080
the EU and on the other hand it makes very complex for companies to implement it and

35:26.080 --> 35:31.800
so open source can really deliver as a positive sum game an easier way to implement for the

35:31.800 --> 35:38.520
regulated industries and a more effective way for the government to enact those policies.

35:38.520 --> 35:45.760
Of course I will continue reiterating that digital sovereignty doesn't mean building

35:45.760 --> 35:46.760
borders.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.440
We don't want to fragment the open source community.

35:50.440 --> 35:57.680
We're going to as Europeans not only lose existing technology is out there but potentially

35:57.680 --> 36:07.320
lose sort of the innovation and the growth potential for the local small and medium businesses

36:07.320 --> 36:09.400
and hopefully growing businesses.

36:09.400 --> 36:18.600
I would like to see larger technology companies in Europe being born out of open source.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.640
The companies invest in open source talent.

36:23.640 --> 36:32.600
Again I have a lot of grievances in the United States but they do invest in talent and that

36:32.600 --> 36:40.080
does allow maintainers to work in open source without having to struggle and that also has

36:40.080 --> 36:43.480
a diversity angle here.

36:43.480 --> 36:51.240
Just folks that cannot in many parts of the world don't have the time to just invest in

36:51.240 --> 36:59.160
open source, to just do it in their own time.

36:59.160 --> 37:05.000
And becoming open source leader I do think that like we've seen for the examples of Google

37:05.000 --> 37:10.800
I was actually talking to a company here yesterday, a local company said we wouldn't even be in

37:10.800 --> 37:15.360
the market if it was not for open source.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.840
That's what got us on the global stage.

37:18.840 --> 37:25.240
And I think if anyone here has the decision making power, if you're trying to sell your

37:25.240 --> 37:33.800
CEO into doing open source, lead with why, lead with how they can commoditize a competitor,

37:33.800 --> 37:39.600
they can become a de facto standard.

37:39.600 --> 37:48.200
And then if you're not able as a company to contribute time or code, well contribute money

37:48.200 --> 37:59.320
to open source through maintainer funding, you know, we have Patreon, GitHub sponsors,

37:59.320 --> 38:04.840
the index foundation as a mentorship platform, there's so many ways to fund open source.

38:04.840 --> 38:12.320
It doesn't have to be foundations, it doesn't have to be directly employing someone.

38:12.320 --> 38:22.600
And then last but not least as an individual, I think you have an amazing potential to be

38:22.600 --> 38:26.200
an activist through technology.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.320
And being an activist I think some of the most successful activists out there are not

38:30.320 --> 38:33.440
just about the quality of the code.

38:33.440 --> 38:38.680
You got to market what you're doing and we're here to help.

38:38.680 --> 38:44.600
I can't promise they will be able to market or promote every single open source project

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
out there.

38:46.600 --> 38:54.280
Been working on this deck until 3 a.m. yesterday and got here 10 minutes late this morning.

38:54.280 --> 39:00.760
But we're there to give visibility to a lot of these projects.

39:00.760 --> 39:08.760
And culture remains still a major fragmentation problem in the industry.

39:08.760 --> 39:13.760
The slide that unfortunately I wasn't able to present showed how there's still a lot

39:13.760 --> 39:14.760
of prejudice.

39:14.760 --> 39:22.560
And so whether it's national, whether it's racial, whether it's political, check it

39:22.560 --> 39:31.520
out the door because it's just not going to, you know, that diverse perspective make better

39:31.520 --> 39:34.080
projects.

39:34.080 --> 39:40.280
And then as a guy with a big ego, this is more of a lesson for myself, put your ego

39:40.280 --> 39:41.280
aside.

39:41.280 --> 39:50.080
If there is, you know, I know as an engineer at heart I have very strong opinions of how

39:50.080 --> 39:57.080
code should be written or how, you know, certain libraries should be done.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.600
There's plenty of reasons why you want to start a new framework.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.880
But there's the whole, there's a world of open source out there.

40:04.880 --> 40:12.280
And we as foundations can do a much better job at showing what projects are healthy,

40:12.280 --> 40:15.200
what projects are aligned with certain goals.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.760
We have a lot to do there.

40:18.760 --> 40:24.040
But if we want to really make that bigger impact, we will need commitment from you guys

40:24.040 --> 40:28.440
to sort of put your ego on the side.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.520
And with that, thank you so much.

40:31.520 --> 40:38.280
I appreciate you being here so early and coping with me being a little late.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.280
Thank you.

40:39.280 --> 40:40.280
I know if there are questions.

40:40.280 --> 40:48.960
Thank you.
