WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.640
First of all, thank you for coming here to this session.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.080
I think it's fantastic to have an audience who is potentially interested with regulation

00:14.080 --> 00:16.560
and compliance.

00:16.560 --> 00:25.240
This is something that impacts all of us as a community, as our users, consumers, and

00:25.240 --> 00:27.860
also from a work perspective.

00:27.860 --> 00:34.600
So I think it's really important to be able to understand what are the impacts of regulations,

00:34.600 --> 00:41.960
compliance, certifications, when we are developing software, when we are sharing our work from

00:41.960 --> 00:49.360
a, I would say, a community perspective, but also when that work goes into production on

00:49.360 --> 00:52.440
systems, critical systems.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.760
So thank you for being here for that.

00:54.760 --> 01:03.840
Today we have the unique opportunity to have some of the folks who wrote, or at least

01:03.840 --> 01:12.680
review wrote, some of the legislation directives, like the Cyber Resilience Act.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.520
And we will go through a couple of lightning talks, because I think it's really important

01:18.520 --> 01:19.840
to set the scene.

01:19.840 --> 01:26.200
So we could start discussing about having a panel, but if we don't understand the overall

01:26.200 --> 01:30.720
construct of those regulations, that's going to be hard.

01:30.720 --> 01:36.700
So I would like to have a warm welcome from Benjamin here.

01:36.700 --> 01:40.560
If you can give him a bit of love.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.440
Thank you.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.500
Thank you.

01:43.500 --> 01:48.980
So we are really honored to have the European Commission here to help us with this.

01:48.980 --> 01:49.980
So thank you.

01:49.980 --> 01:54.400
Benjamin, up to you.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.720
Thank you very much.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.640
Thank you so much for having me and also for showing interest in our work.

02:00.640 --> 02:06.440
That will maybe affect some of you, but most of you probably won't be affected by it.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.680
I mean, as a commission, we are always trying very hard to reach out to all the people that

02:11.680 --> 02:16.000
could potentially be affected by our regulation, but it's sometimes a bit difficult.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.520
I mean, it's often mostly large companies that have the resources to actually engage

02:21.520 --> 02:22.520
with us.

02:22.520 --> 02:27.320
So I'm really happy to be here, and I'm so glad that so many of you decided also to stay

02:27.320 --> 02:30.120
for this panel.

02:30.120 --> 02:35.320
So the Cyber Resilience Act is a new proposal of the European Commission.

02:35.320 --> 02:42.760
It intends to improve the cybersecurity of hardware and software products.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.360
It's intended to complete a puzzle.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.280
So there's already other legislation at union level on cybersecurity.

02:50.280 --> 02:56.720
Most notably, there is the NIS directive, which has recently been reformed.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.940
The NIS directive focuses more on the users of hardware and software.

03:00.940 --> 03:06.640
So it ensures that large companies, critical infrastructure providers and so forth take

03:06.640 --> 03:10.760
security seriously, do their patches regularly and all that.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.520
But the Cyber Resilience Act now focuses on the other side, on the manufacturers of these

03:15.520 --> 03:16.520
products.

03:16.520 --> 03:22.200
And, I mean, I know that many of you are probably not dealing with policy every day, and it's

03:22.200 --> 03:25.080
particular not with European Union policy.

03:25.080 --> 03:30.800
So I've just added one slide at the very beginning to quickly explain to you what the commission

03:30.800 --> 03:34.800
is and where we are in this process and who the other players are.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.980
So yeah, this is highly simplified.

03:37.980 --> 03:42.040
It's much more complicated than that, unfortunately.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.280
So I work for the European Commission for the director general connect.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.580
It's like the director generals, they are like departments within the commission.

03:52.580 --> 03:58.960
So we mostly deal with telecommunications, internet, emerging technologies and so forth.

03:58.960 --> 04:05.360
And it is the European Commission that makes legislative proposals in the European Union.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.320
So we write the draft, and then we propose this draft to the so-called co-legislators.

04:11.320 --> 04:17.600
That's European Parliament and where you have the members of European Parliament, so parliamentarians,

04:17.600 --> 04:21.440
and the council that represents the 27 member states.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.600
And these two institutions, they analyze the commission's proposal, they come up with their

04:26.600 --> 04:32.560
own positions, and once they've done that, they negotiate with one another.

04:32.560 --> 04:38.600
And at the very end, once they agree on a common line, a common position, they adopt

04:38.600 --> 04:40.440
the text and it enters into force.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.520
It becomes a law.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.840
So this is basically how it works.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.240
It's very simplified.

04:44.240 --> 04:51.480
So our proposal came out on 15 September 2022, so in autumn.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.580
And it's now with parliament and council.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.560
Parliament has not yet started discussing it.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.360
They're still sorting out which committees will be in charge of it.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.640
But council is already at full speed.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.920
There are regular meetings every second Wednesday.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.760
The council is meeting to discuss the text proposed by the commission.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.560
So that's just for your background.

05:11.560 --> 05:16.000
And now we'll talk about the substance of the proposal.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.400
So what are we trying to achieve?

05:19.400 --> 05:25.840
So we want to reduce the number of vulnerabilities in hardware and software products.

05:25.840 --> 05:33.240
Of course we know that it's an unrealistic goal to aim for zero vulnerabilities in products.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.800
And this is what this slide represents.

05:34.800 --> 05:40.000
So the cheese represents a hardware software product filled with holes.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.360
I mean, I know not all are filled with holes, but many are.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.380
And I mean, we attempt to reduce the number of such security holes in hardware and software

05:48.380 --> 05:52.440
products through legislation.

05:52.440 --> 05:57.920
And yeah, I will just get right into the main elements of the proposal to give you an overview

05:57.920 --> 06:00.980
and then I will provide some more details.

06:00.980 --> 06:06.360
So it's all about providing cybersecurity rules for hardware and software products when

06:06.360 --> 06:07.760
they're placed on the market.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.260
So placing on the market entails that we're talking about commercial activities here.

06:12.260 --> 06:16.320
So companies that make money with hardware and software products, they will have to follow

06:16.320 --> 06:17.320
these rules.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.440
We're using a well-established framework.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.320
It's called the new legislative framework.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.880
It's been used in the past by the European Union to regulate other products such as toys

06:27.880 --> 06:31.060
or machinery or electrical equipment.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.520
And you may not know it, but you're all actually very familiar with it.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.980
So whenever you see a product that has the CE marking on it, CE, I will show it later,

06:39.980 --> 06:44.640
like you have it, for example, on laptops or iPhone chargers and such things.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.220
So this is all new legislative framework regulation then.

06:49.220 --> 06:54.520
What we do in the proposal is we establish obligations for three types of economic operators

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
for the manufacturers.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.960
I mean, that's the core element, of course, of the proposal.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.080
But then there are also the distributors.

07:01.080 --> 07:06.880
These are brick and mortar stores, online shops, and also importers that place products

07:06.880 --> 07:10.400
on the European market that have been developed in third countries.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.600
And the importers and the distributors, they don't have to, I mean, they don't do secure

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
coding, of course.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.480
They're just selling products, but they have to ensure that the products that they are

07:19.480 --> 07:27.280
selling are, like, in line, I mean, that they comply with the Cyber Resilience Act.

07:27.280 --> 07:34.600
One of the core novelties of our proposal is that it does not just cover rules for the

07:34.600 --> 07:38.960
placing on the market, so what the product should look like, but it also covers the period

07:38.960 --> 07:41.120
after that, the entire life cycle.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.840
So I mean, you all know that for cybersecurity.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.920
It's extremely important that you keep tracking your products, that you ensure that when you

07:48.920 --> 07:53.000
discover new vulnerabilities, that you fix them, you mitigate them, you provide patches

07:53.000 --> 07:54.240
and so forth.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.720
And this is part of our proposal that for a period of five years after the placing on

07:58.720 --> 08:00.760
the market of a product, you do that.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.160
You provide security updates.

08:04.160 --> 08:10.480
One essential element of any new legislative framework regulation is harmonized standards.

08:10.480 --> 08:16.960
So the rules that we propose in the Cyber Resilience Act, they are very high level, technology

08:16.960 --> 08:19.240
neutral, objective oriented.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.160
I mean, if you go through the proposal, you will see they are really high level.

08:22.160 --> 08:31.360
It's more like on the level of provide a secure by default configuration, take care of access

08:31.360 --> 08:36.760
management, make sure data is handled confidentially and so forth.

08:36.760 --> 08:43.880
So really high level, but then we have the standards that will be developed by the European

08:43.880 --> 08:45.920
Standardization Organizations.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
You may have heard of them.

08:46.920 --> 08:49.840
They are called SANS-ANILAC and ETSI.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.040
And they are voluntary.

08:52.040 --> 08:57.500
You don't need to use these standards, but they will help you write secure products.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.360
And then there is also the conformity assessment.

09:01.360 --> 09:06.040
So manufacturers, they will have to demonstrate that their products are actually compliant,

09:06.040 --> 09:08.840
but I will explain that in more detail later.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.520
And finally, there is the market surveillance.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.600
So in all the member states, you will have authorities that can check out the products

09:14.600 --> 09:22.000
and approach manufacturers, ask them to remediate vulnerabilities, eliminate risks, and if they

09:22.000 --> 09:26.560
don't comply, even hand out fines.

09:26.560 --> 09:33.740
So the scope of the proposal, it's hardware and software products, products, not services.

09:33.740 --> 09:39.000
So when I say hardware products and software products, I mean final products such as laptops

09:39.000 --> 09:47.920
or operating systems, but also components such as CPUs, hard drives, software libraries,

09:47.920 --> 09:50.060
and so forth.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.460
We don't regulate services.

09:52.460 --> 09:55.600
So software as a service is outside the scope of this proposal.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.640
That's already regulated by the NIS directive, which I mentioned earlier.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.560
But we do regulate something that we call remote data processing solutions.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.940
So often today, products, they actually come with some cloud or other elements such as

10:09.940 --> 10:12.200
many mobile applications.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.480
They usually they access data in the cloud, and these are essential functionalities of

10:16.480 --> 10:17.840
the program.

10:17.840 --> 10:23.620
And then you would also have to ensure the security of these remote data processing solutions.

10:23.620 --> 10:27.120
As I already explained, we only regulate commercial products.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.960
So anything that is non-commercial is outside the scope, including open source when it's

10:31.960 --> 10:33.380
non-commercial.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.320
But on the other hand, open source that is commercial, I mean there are a lot of large

10:37.320 --> 10:42.320
commercial projects, I'm sure you're aware of them, they would be covered.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.160
And then we exclude certain products that are already regulated by other regulations

10:46.160 --> 10:48.520
such as cars or medical devices.

10:48.520 --> 10:54.800
Yeah, I mean why did we choose to exclude non-commercial open source software from the

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
scope?

10:55.800 --> 10:59.880
Well, there are a few reasons, and first of all, this is standard practice for any new

10:59.880 --> 11:03.740
legislative framework product regulation at union level.

11:03.740 --> 11:07.040
We only focus on commercial activities.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.920
But also in the case of open source, there are some more special considerations that

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
we took.

11:11.920 --> 11:17.520
So first of all, would it be fair to regulate someone that does not make a profit with a

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
product, right?

11:18.520 --> 11:19.600
I mean, and we think it would not.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.280
And wouldn't we be setting the wrong incentives to regulate someone who doesn't make money

11:24.280 --> 11:25.280
with it, right?

11:25.280 --> 11:31.160
Would you keep developing something if you're asked to like follow regulation and you're

11:31.160 --> 11:32.640
not even earning money with it?

11:32.640 --> 11:36.840
So we would be setting the wrong incentives, that's why we decided to exclude them.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.920
And then of course we also know that open source, I mean, it's critical often from a

11:40.920 --> 11:46.720
cybersecurity perspective, but it's just as critical from an innovation and growth perspective.

11:46.720 --> 11:52.320
I mean, there are so many small companies, medium-sized companies that use your components,

11:52.320 --> 11:57.320
your products, free of charge to develop on top other products and services.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.440
And for them it's crucial that they have access to this resource.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.440
And that's, I mean, we are fully aware of that.

12:04.440 --> 12:10.500
And my colleague, Rice, he will, I mean, he will later on the panel also explain to you

12:10.500 --> 12:17.200
in how many other ways we support open source as the European Commission.

12:17.200 --> 12:21.840
So here in a nutshell, the obligations that manufacturers of commercial products would

12:21.840 --> 12:24.080
have to comply with.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.820
I mean, first you do a risk assessment of your product during the design phase.

12:28.820 --> 12:33.560
Then you comply with the essential requirements that are in the regulation.

12:33.560 --> 12:39.040
I explained earlier what they look like, these high-level objective-oriented requirements.

12:39.040 --> 12:44.400
Then you establish vulnerability handling processes such as a coordinated vulnerability

12:44.400 --> 12:47.440
disclosure policy.

12:47.440 --> 12:51.960
And yeah, of course, I mean, with any legislation you will have to document in which way you

12:51.960 --> 12:53.480
comply.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.960
This would be called a technical file.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.320
And once you've done all that, once you've done the conformity assessment, you can affix

13:00.320 --> 13:02.540
the CE marking to your product.

13:02.540 --> 13:07.720
And then for a period of five years, you will be required to handle the vulnerabilities

13:07.720 --> 13:10.840
that arise in your products.

13:10.840 --> 13:15.960
On top of that, there's also an obligation to report critical vulnerabilities to our

13:15.960 --> 13:18.080
cybersecurity agency.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.440
We are talking about vulnerabilities that are already exploited in the wild by criminal

13:22.440 --> 13:26.920
actors, but that have not been necessarily fixed.

13:26.920 --> 13:33.320
And this is for the purpose of helping national authorities mitigate risks in critical infrastructure

13:33.320 --> 13:36.240
and so forth.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.640
Here's one example of how we are also trying to help the community.

13:39.640 --> 13:45.440
So in the Article 11, which is about the reporting requirements for manufacturers, we require

13:45.440 --> 13:49.920
them whenever they integrate a component and they discover a vulnerability in it, and this

13:49.920 --> 13:55.760
could be an open source component, that they notify the entity or the person that maintains

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
this component.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.140
I mean, so people like you often, for example.

13:59.140 --> 14:03.680
So for example, when you go from GitHub, when you source a component and then you discover

14:03.680 --> 14:08.760
a vulnerability, at least you should reach out to the maintainer and inform them of the

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
vulnerability.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.400
Ideally do more.

14:11.400 --> 14:15.040
Maybe even provide code to fix it.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.820
So here is how it works as regards components.

14:18.820 --> 14:24.360
This is an example of a smartphone manufacturer that builds a smartphone.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.440
So there will be some components.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.920
Here you see them on the left-hand side in blue.

14:28.920 --> 14:32.720
These are components that the manufacturer develops themselves.

14:32.720 --> 14:38.160
So they would not be placed on the market separately, but as part of the final product.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.340
And then for these components, you would not need to do a separate conformity assessment,

14:42.340 --> 14:44.760
but it would be part of the final product.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.040
But then there are other components.

14:46.040 --> 14:51.120
You see them on the right-hand side, such as the ones that are developed by upstream

14:51.120 --> 14:52.120
manufacturers.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.120
So here you see the RAM or the CPU.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.280
In that example, it would be manufactured by someone else.

14:57.280 --> 15:01.960
So these are placed on the market separately, and it would be the upstream manufacturer

15:01.960 --> 15:07.160
who would need to ensure the security of these components and to fix the CE marking.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.620
And of course, the manufacturer of the smartphone is responsible for the entire product, right?

15:11.620 --> 15:15.040
Just because you integrate a component of someone else doesn't mean you don't take

15:15.040 --> 15:21.240
any responsibility for it, but you would need to do due diligence when you integrate those

15:21.240 --> 15:22.400
components.

15:22.400 --> 15:28.560
Yeah, so these are the categories for the conformity assessment that we propose.

15:28.560 --> 15:35.500
For the vast majority of products, the default category, you would do the conformity assessment

15:35.500 --> 15:37.160
yourself as a manufacturer.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.240
You do not need to interact with any third party.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.680
But then there is a smaller list of critical products, which you can find in the annex

15:43.680 --> 15:45.360
of our proposal.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.220
That's roughly 10% of the scope.

15:48.220 --> 15:52.840
And there we require more stringent conformity assessment and sometimes even independent

15:52.840 --> 15:55.080
third party assessment.

15:55.080 --> 16:00.320
Examples of these more critical products are firewalls, CPUs, or operating systems.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.760
And then there is also a possibility for highly critical products.

16:04.760 --> 16:11.480
We are not making use of that now, but we are proposing that in the future we can add

16:11.480 --> 16:16.960
highly critical products to a list for which it would be necessary to undergo a mandatory

16:16.960 --> 16:18.300
certification.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.920
We do not have any products in mind.

16:19.920 --> 16:25.520
This is really just to future-proof the legislation because we all know that digital products

16:25.520 --> 16:29.400
permeate society more and more and we become more and more dependent on them.

16:29.400 --> 16:34.200
And there may be a point at which we will rely on such crucial products that we need

16:34.200 --> 16:36.800
even a higher level of assurance.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.280
I don't know, think human brain interfaces or something like that.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.520
I mean, yeah.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.520
Okay.

16:42.520 --> 16:46.840
This is the CE marking that you're all very familiar with.

16:46.840 --> 16:51.480
We are also trying to facilitate compliance for the manufacturers as much as possible.

16:51.480 --> 16:56.880
So we would be providing after the entry into force of the proposal compliance on how to

16:56.880 --> 17:05.600
– sorry – guidance on compliance in general, as well as examples how to do things in practice,

17:05.600 --> 17:10.760
for example, on how to delineate what is a commercial product, what is a non-commercial

17:10.760 --> 17:11.760
product.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.840
We will also, I mean, as I said, develop these harmonized standards.

17:16.840 --> 17:20.760
We are looking into providing funding through the Digital Europe Program – that's a European

17:20.760 --> 17:25.760
funding initiative – for national market surveillance authorities, but also for manufacturers

17:25.760 --> 17:27.620
to help them comply.

17:27.620 --> 17:34.080
But then, frankly, we are also counting on you, on the community, on software developers,

17:34.080 --> 17:38.840
on the market also, to come up with tools that can help facilitate compliance.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.880
I mean, many of these tools already exist, of course, such as static and dynamic code

17:42.880 --> 17:49.200
analysis tools, S-bomb generators, but, I mean, you name it, there can be any number

17:49.200 --> 17:54.320
of tools that could help facilitate compliance, maybe to generate some of the documentation

17:54.320 --> 18:00.080
automatically and, I mean, also be extremely open to ideas how to facilitate this, so feel

18:00.080 --> 18:04.800
free to approach me after the panel and we can discuss it.

18:04.800 --> 18:10.400
Here, this is the timeline, just for you to better understand, and this is also my last

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
slide.

18:11.400 --> 18:15.200
So, as I said, we made the proposal on 15 September.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.920
We are now undergoing this legislative process.

18:17.920 --> 18:23.700
We are hoping to conclude it before the European elections in May 2024.

18:23.700 --> 18:28.600
And then, once it's done and enters into force, we will launch a request for standardisation

18:28.600 --> 18:31.520
with the European standardisation bodies.

18:31.520 --> 18:36.520
And then, 24 months later, it would enter into application, so that's when manufacturers

18:36.520 --> 18:41.320
would need to comply with the rules and also when the harmonised standards would become

18:41.320 --> 18:42.320
available.

18:42.320 --> 18:48.480
Yeah, so there's still plenty of time for you to help within the process, to reach out

18:48.480 --> 18:53.840
to members of Parliament if you have concern or to the member state authorities and get

18:53.840 --> 18:54.840
involved.

18:54.840 --> 18:59.240
We are, of course, also extremely interested in your views, so you can also reach out to

18:59.240 --> 19:00.240
us.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.320
I mean, I also brought some business parts, so later, if you're interested, you can have

19:03.320 --> 19:04.320
some.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.680
And, yeah, I mean, I'm extremely looking forward to the discussion now.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.680
Thanks.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.560
Sorry for being so fast, but I only have 15 minutes.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.560
Thank you, Benjamin.

19:12.560 --> 19:22.400
So, I don't know if you saw me moving around during the talk, but we were discussing cyber

19:22.400 --> 19:26.800
resilience and also potential software defect.

19:26.800 --> 19:33.040
I just escorted a bug outside how convenient it was, so saving a bug.

19:33.040 --> 19:43.240
So now we're transitioning to Martin from NLNet Labs and he's going to give us his point

19:43.240 --> 19:53.120
of view of the CRA based on from an NGO, so a non-government agency or office, organisation,

19:53.120 --> 19:54.200
sorry.

19:54.200 --> 19:59.000
So this is a different approach.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.840
And, yeah, they are dealing with DNS, so that might be an important infrastructure element

20:06.840 --> 20:10.720
to consider in this topic.

20:10.720 --> 20:19.800
One more come from Martin, please.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
Good morning, everyone.

20:20.800 --> 20:27.360
So, I'm really grateful that Benjamin just did the hard work of explaining the legislation

20:27.360 --> 20:33.560
and for me the, I suppose, easier part of reacting to it.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.880
So my name is Martin Arzter.

20:35.880 --> 20:42.080
I work for NLNet Labs, which is a non-profit R&D organisation.

20:42.080 --> 20:45.320
We make open source software for the internet.

20:45.320 --> 20:51.040
I stole this terminology from a great report from quite a while ago.

20:51.040 --> 20:57.080
And what we do is we develop internet standards or we contribute to the development of internet

20:57.080 --> 21:01.080
standards and we make implementations.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.040
And the specific area of focus that we have...

21:05.040 --> 21:10.440
The mic closer to you.

21:10.440 --> 21:14.040
I will...

21:14.040 --> 21:18.600
So the specific work that we do is we develop, we contribute to the development of internet

21:18.600 --> 21:24.000
standards and we make implementations in software that are open source.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.320
And we've been doing this for two decades.

21:26.320 --> 21:32.680
We make software in the areas of DNS and we make software in the area of routing, specifically

21:32.680 --> 21:33.880
routing safety.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.840
And what we also do is we try to bring that knowledge to policymakers and that's what

21:38.840 --> 21:44.400
I'm doing hopefully today.

21:44.400 --> 21:50.120
So Benjamin just talked about the scoping and he mentioned that most of us would be

21:50.120 --> 21:52.040
out of scope.

21:52.040 --> 21:57.560
And when I read the proposal in September, October, I wasn't so sure.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.920
And I think that's something we should discuss.

21:59.920 --> 22:07.560
So there is a recital in the text that basically reads free and open source software should

22:07.560 --> 22:14.800
not be covered by this regulation, which is I think we should be very happy that the Commission

22:14.800 --> 22:24.320
is aware of open source and has taken concern to actually address this in new legislation

22:24.320 --> 22:25.880
that they come up with.

22:25.880 --> 22:31.720
I think that is something we should celebrate much like the fact that open source has been

22:31.720 --> 22:33.120
here for 25 years.

22:33.120 --> 22:39.520
So maybe a little warm round of applause just to acknowledge that we've been heard.

22:39.520 --> 22:46.320
And what I want to talk about today is the fact that there's a clause here and it says

22:46.320 --> 22:50.320
outside the course of a commercial activity.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.480
And what is a commercial activity?

22:52.480 --> 22:53.640
There are some examples.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.120
It's not a defined term.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.880
And one of the examples that is relevant to my organization, to Nellet Labs, is specifically

23:00.880 --> 23:06.840
that what is called out is that if you charge a price for technical support services, then

23:06.840 --> 23:09.040
you are considered commercial.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.280
So the organization I work for is a registered charity.

23:12.280 --> 23:17.440
We make software, we develop standards, we give it away for free, we give away updates

23:17.440 --> 23:19.080
for free.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.860
And yet we employ people with mortgages.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.280
So the question is how are we supposed to make money?

23:25.280 --> 23:32.380
And we found a way, namely the network operators that use our software want it to be available

23:32.380 --> 23:33.380
long term.

23:33.380 --> 23:36.920
And they want there to be different implementations available.

23:36.920 --> 23:42.140
So they've chosen to pay us to provide support.

23:42.140 --> 23:48.640
And so this makes our work a commercial activity, at least in the way we read this text.

23:48.640 --> 23:53.400
I would be glad to be wrong about most of the slides I'm showing you today.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.560
And please tell me if I am.

23:55.560 --> 24:01.240
But that's why we got interested in this legislation.

24:01.240 --> 24:08.020
And there are some risks if you look at this exception, because if you have an expansive

24:08.020 --> 24:13.400
interpretation of the word commercial, then the exception is narrow.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.840
It's this balance, right, depending on how you interpret commercial.

24:16.840 --> 24:23.120
And if it's a narrow scope of exception, then what you create is a disincentive for open

24:23.120 --> 24:29.040
source developers who start working on something in their free time to professionalize.

24:29.040 --> 24:35.920
Because at some point when you hit this commercial qualifier, then you come into scope of regulation.

24:35.920 --> 24:41.260
And there's nothing bad about regulation per se, but we have to acknowledge that the step

24:41.260 --> 24:46.840
from not being regulated to be regulated is a change, right?

24:46.840 --> 24:51.920
And what we don't want to happen is for charities like an elite labs and others who make this

24:51.920 --> 24:58.160
kind of software to realize that the way they've been able to sustain their development is

24:58.160 --> 25:00.440
now disappearing.

25:00.440 --> 25:07.000
So what we don't want is for there to be an incentive to move to closed source software.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.280
And finally, especially in the area of DNS, what we want is product diversity.

25:12.280 --> 25:21.280
So it's not a good outcome if we go to a place where there's less organizations working on

25:21.280 --> 25:26.360
these projects, because with what we want is different implementations that do not share

25:26.360 --> 25:29.920
code for stability.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.480
So it's not just me.

25:31.480 --> 25:36.440
The OSI reacted to the response, and they said, and I like this quote a lot, the problem

25:36.440 --> 25:39.760
is not the lack of taxonomy of commercial.

25:39.760 --> 25:44.160
So the solution is not explaining what commercial is supposed to be.

25:44.160 --> 25:49.280
It is the very act of making commercial the qualification rather than deployment for trade.

25:49.280 --> 25:56.240
And what is relevant about this quote is that there's a very different, the act of maintaining

25:56.240 --> 26:02.680
and creating software, and the cost of that is very distinct from the act of profiting

26:02.680 --> 26:04.280
from its deployment.

26:04.280 --> 26:10.040
And if you confuse these two steps, then you and commercial may help you confuse those

26:10.040 --> 26:14.840
steps, then we get into this place.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.800
So that's about general scoping issues.

26:16.800 --> 26:23.200
I'd like now to move to specific concerns we have from an elite labs.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.800
And why do we have concerns?

26:24.800 --> 26:31.080
Because we have products, we make unbound the resolver, we make some other product.

26:31.080 --> 26:36.920
At least we believe it's not an unreasonable interpretation to consider the stuff we release,

26:36.920 --> 26:39.040
including binaries, to be products.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.200
And maybe we're wrong.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.320
I'd love to hear that.

26:42.320 --> 26:47.040
So if we are product, and if what we do is considered commercial, then there are some

26:47.040 --> 26:52.400
unintended consequences by being covered by this legislation.

26:52.400 --> 26:59.640
Because currently we are an outfit with 15 people, 14 of whom are either software engineers

26:59.640 --> 27:03.320
or developers.

27:03.320 --> 27:10.440
Every effort we put into proving that we're doing the right thing, the compliance bit,

27:10.440 --> 27:17.480
which is a logical part of any legislation, every effort that we spend on compliance will

27:17.480 --> 27:20.600
not be spent on securing our software.

27:20.600 --> 27:26.360
And the only reason why a charity like ours exists is making secure software, resilient

27:26.360 --> 27:30.200
software for internet infrastructure.

27:30.200 --> 27:37.360
And if you look at the annex three list of critical products, it doesn't take too much

27:37.360 --> 27:45.280
imagination to frame most of what we do as critical products in terms of this legislation.

27:45.280 --> 27:52.400
And I think Benjamin explained about the way to avoid having to call in third party auditors.

27:52.400 --> 27:57.800
But it depends on the availability of European standards that are applicable to our work.

27:57.800 --> 28:04.160
And in general, I think most of us are not engaged in the European policy process.

28:04.160 --> 28:09.320
And even less of us are involved at the European standards institutions.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.760
Because basically we have no need to be there at this point in time.

28:12.760 --> 28:15.080
And we have not had a need in the past.

28:15.080 --> 28:19.000
So at an outlet we work quite a lot on standardization.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.960
But it's at multi stakeholder forms, accessible to any party without payment, et cetera.

28:24.960 --> 28:30.320
And that's not how these European standardization institutions work, unfortunately.

28:30.320 --> 28:35.240
So the escape hatch, if you are a critical product, to not have to call in third party

28:35.240 --> 28:39.060
auditors may not actually be available in practice.

28:39.060 --> 28:46.440
And that means we will have a costly burden checking our processes, which does not actually

28:46.440 --> 28:48.920
contribute to the quality of code.

28:48.920 --> 28:54.960
And that's why I think this is a concern for us, or at least an unintended consequence.

28:54.960 --> 29:00.000
There's also text in there which requires you to fix all known vulnerabilities.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.920
And this does not have a regard for severity.

29:03.920 --> 29:09.680
And what this does is if you have to fix all known vulnerabilities, then this skews your

29:09.680 --> 29:15.020
engineering effort from practices that protect you against unknown vulnerabilities.

29:15.020 --> 29:19.400
So this is this I think this is not what it was actually intended.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.800
I'm just flagging it.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.280
Because we I think we want there to be good laws.

29:24.280 --> 29:28.040
And we want to help in a democracy to achieve those good laws.

29:28.040 --> 29:33.880
I mean, why if you live in a democracy and you like that, why not contribute, I suppose.

29:33.880 --> 29:38.240
Otherwise, there's not a lot of points.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.560
So there's also more detailed concerns.

29:41.560 --> 29:48.720
So for example, we currently have the opportunity to provide security updates to providers we

29:48.720 --> 29:52.120
know are extremely critical to the functioning of the Internet.

29:52.120 --> 29:57.760
So if we are about to release a patch and give full information about what it fixes,

29:57.760 --> 30:05.820
we can choose to provide a update just ahead of time to a, for example, root server operator

30:05.820 --> 30:12.480
or some other entity which is not equal in terms of importance to all of society.

30:12.480 --> 30:17.640
And the current text takes away our ability to do so because it requires us to do everything

30:17.640 --> 30:25.780
at the same time, which may not actually benefit security, which is the goal.

30:25.780 --> 30:31.280
There's also obligations to report incidents that actually relate to third party use of

30:31.280 --> 30:32.480
our software.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.360
So we don't do any operations.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.720
We just develop software.

30:36.720 --> 30:42.000
But if we are obliged to report incidents that relate to the use of our software, this

30:42.000 --> 30:47.480
gets into a conflict of our role of remediating vulnerabilities.

30:47.480 --> 30:53.160
And this is the case because these third parties may have some reason not to go public with

30:53.160 --> 30:54.920
an incident at first.

30:54.920 --> 31:01.840
If you create a conflict of interest in talking to us, then we may need longer to fix the

31:01.840 --> 31:06.480
vulnerability if there is such a thing.

31:06.480 --> 31:14.280
What we don't know, and this is more of an uncertainty, we don't know what constitutes

31:14.280 --> 31:16.440
substantial modification.

31:16.440 --> 31:23.360
So the whole idea that you trigger reassessment of your product for the CE marking, it hinges

31:23.360 --> 31:29.200
on the fact that when substantial modification is made, you need to do it again.

31:29.200 --> 31:33.920
And we currently don't know if that's a major release, minor release, patch release.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.280
We do quite a lot of releases.

31:37.280 --> 31:43.520
And depending on how this pans out, we may spend a lot of work doing compliance and less

31:43.520 --> 31:46.640
work of doing release engineering.

31:46.640 --> 31:54.600
Finally, there is some clause about time limited availability of software for testing purposes.

31:54.600 --> 31:59.240
I think that's fundamentally incompatible with how open source is done.

31:59.240 --> 32:04.760
Much of the points I've made today, we worked on together with ISE, the authors of Bind,

32:04.760 --> 32:06.560
among others.

32:06.560 --> 32:13.160
And on their website, you can download about 30 years of binaries, of all versions of Bind

32:13.160 --> 32:18.880
ever made, which is really helpful if you're trying to find issues, vulnerabilities, whatever

32:18.880 --> 32:21.120
you try to.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.640
But the...

32:23.640 --> 32:29.120
So what we don't want is for them to have to get this stuff offline, because I don't

32:29.120 --> 32:34.320
think it actually helps us reduce vulnerabilities.

32:34.320 --> 32:39.640
So if you are interested in this stuff, I recommend you to read further, because this

32:39.640 --> 32:45.880
was just my perspective, and Elnett Labs as a charity employing people that are getting

32:45.880 --> 32:51.560
paid full time to develop open source software is not very common, and I realize that.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.080
But you don't have to take it from me.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.240
You can also read about other responses.

32:56.240 --> 33:05.200
So there's the work of OSI, there's work by Open Forum Europe, Brussels-based think tank

33:05.200 --> 33:10.680
which collects voices from other organizations relating to open source, including commercial

33:10.680 --> 33:11.720
ones.

33:11.720 --> 33:17.040
And Simon, who's in the front here, maybe he can raise his hand, actually compiled a

33:17.040 --> 33:20.080
list of responses by other...

33:20.080 --> 33:25.720
So you can take a look yourself and have a...

33:25.720 --> 33:27.120
And give it some thought.

33:27.120 --> 33:32.560
I wanted also to quickly give a shout out to a blog written by Thomas DePierre.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.440
I'm hoping I'm not butchering your name.

33:35.440 --> 33:40.280
And it relates to supply chain thinking, how that's currently quite dominant in thinking

33:40.280 --> 33:42.520
about security for open source.

33:42.520 --> 33:49.480
And his point is basically supply chain thinking doesn't work if someone in this supply chain

33:49.480 --> 33:54.200
is not actually considering themselves to be a supplier.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.720
So that's it with respect to what I had to say.

33:57.720 --> 34:02.760
In summary, we believe that these goals that the Commission is trying to achieve are worthy

34:02.760 --> 34:03.760
goals.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.800
And as a consumer, I would like them to succeed.

34:06.800 --> 34:11.800
However, there's also some unintended consequences in their current proposal.

34:11.800 --> 34:18.360
And I think we should aim as a society to fix those.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.480
I'm very interested to hear your perspective.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.040
And for now, I'd like to thank you for your attention.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.040
And I'm looking forward to the panel.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.040
Thank you.

34:28.040 --> 34:34.480
Thank you, Martin.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.240
We hit 30 minutes with two different opinions and views.

34:38.240 --> 34:44.120
Is there some questions in the audience?

34:44.120 --> 34:45.120
Not yet?

34:45.120 --> 34:47.960
Oh, one, two.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.280
Two questions.

34:51.280 --> 34:56.680
I'm from the UK.

34:56.680 --> 35:02.080
So how does that affect other European countries that may be?

35:02.080 --> 35:05.080
Okay.

35:05.080 --> 35:09.440
How does it affect the UK and the UK working with Europe?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.440
We're still part of Europe after Brexit.

35:12.440 --> 35:18.240
And secondly, how does it affect what's happening in the US in terms of all the stuff that NIST

35:18.240 --> 35:24.200
is doing, particularly on, you know, from the executive order that happened in 2021?

35:24.200 --> 35:27.520
I couldn't hear the second question.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.160
The second question was how does this affect the US?

35:32.160 --> 35:34.320
So thanks a lot for that question.

35:34.320 --> 35:39.600
So for the cyber resilience act, we are applying the same principle as for any other union

35:39.600 --> 35:43.880
legislation that is about services or products.

35:43.880 --> 35:48.400
So whenever you provide a service or a product in the European Union, you have to comply

35:48.400 --> 35:50.680
with the rules of the European Union.

35:50.680 --> 35:56.560
So that means for the cyber resilience act, if you provide a hardware or software manufactured

35:56.560 --> 36:02.000
outside the European Union to consumers or other users within the Union, you would have

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
to comply with the cyber resilience act.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.800
So there's absolutely no difference.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.480
It doesn't matter where you're located.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.240
If you want to sell your products here, then you have to comply.

36:11.240 --> 36:17.920
So there's also no risk that there would be an advantage for maybe manufacturers from

36:17.920 --> 36:22.280
America or so forth that they would not have to comply and therefore have lower costs.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.040
No, it's an elite level playing field.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.080
Everyone who wants to sell their products here would have to comply with the same rules.

36:29.080 --> 36:33.360
I hope that answers your question.

36:33.360 --> 36:51.360
Hi, why is policy the right place to put these measures into effect rather than a standardization's

36:51.360 --> 36:59.560
body like ISO, which already does a lot of the same things and provides people who want

36:59.560 --> 37:14.160
the guarantees associated with this reliability testing to select products that comply with

37:14.160 --> 37:16.880
the ISO requirements?

37:16.880 --> 37:23.360
Okay, if I understood the question, the question is why we think that a mandatory approach

37:23.360 --> 37:25.200
is necessary, right?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
Right.

37:26.200 --> 37:36.040
Why is the mandatory approach necessary instead of a voluntary approach that could be selected

37:36.040 --> 37:38.600
by consumers who want it?

37:38.600 --> 37:43.440
Yeah, I mean, the voluntary approach is the approach that we took basically for the last

37:43.440 --> 37:45.800
20 years, right?

37:45.800 --> 37:46.800
And it hasn't worked.

37:46.800 --> 37:51.200
I mean, we are not eager to regulate new sectors.

37:51.200 --> 37:57.200
I mean, especially when it comes to such innovation and growth fostering sectors such as hardware

37:57.200 --> 37:58.200
and software.

37:58.200 --> 38:01.600
So, I mean, that's one of the reasons why the Commission of the European Union for a

38:01.600 --> 38:04.680
long time decided not to regulate.

38:04.680 --> 38:11.640
But we see that, you know, despite of new standards coming out, development of lots

38:11.640 --> 38:21.760
of secure development, lifecycle, guidance, new programming languages that are memory

38:21.760 --> 38:23.160
safe, I mean, all this is coming.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.160
We see that.

38:24.160 --> 38:28.000
But nonetheless, I mean, the vulnerabilities, they are not going down.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
And we see actually more cybersecurity incidents than ever before.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.080
And this is why we chose to regulate.

38:34.080 --> 38:41.040
I mean, in our view, there is simply not sufficient incentive for the market to take cybersecurity

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
as seriously as it should.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.280
I mean, you all know this.

38:45.280 --> 38:51.280
I mean, you have so many specific features in this market such as time to market.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.480
I mean, first mover advantage, who is the first one to build a platform wins basically

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
the whole market.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
Yeah.

38:57.480 --> 39:02.320
So, under all these constraints, manufacturers do not have an incentive to prioritize cybersecurity.

39:02.320 --> 39:06.920
And we feel that this can only be fixed through regulation.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
Thank you.

39:07.920 --> 39:11.680
So, there is more questions to come, but we have a panel after.

39:11.680 --> 39:16.080
So you will be keep your question and ask your question after so that we can proceed

39:16.080 --> 39:18.920
with the last presentation.

39:18.920 --> 39:24.200
I was also thinking about the same thing as you, sir, about the ISO part.

39:24.200 --> 39:30.400
Working with customers and partners at Red Hat, I can tell you that they need a directive

39:30.400 --> 39:32.720
or a compliance based on the law.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.200
Otherwise, they will never apply the things.

39:36.200 --> 39:42.880
The next speaker, Omar, is going to introduce us to the other part, which is more like the

39:42.880 --> 39:49.360
defective product and what it means in terms of liability.

39:49.360 --> 39:55.240
So please welcome Omar with a round of applause.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.240
Thank you.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
You okay with that?

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
Yeah, we can see you, right?

39:58.240 --> 40:03.240
I think Martin will show you how to use that.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.240
Yeah, I think it's...

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
Yeah, perfect.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.240
Thank you.

40:06.240 --> 40:09.240
Thank you for the invitation.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.560
Thank you to be here.

40:11.560 --> 40:17.720
I'm going to try to not use too much legal terms because I think now we're going to enter

40:17.720 --> 40:23.080
a zone that if you're not a lawyer, you will not really understand what we're talking about.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.680
So I will kind of try to use more simple situations.

40:26.680 --> 40:32.960
I think the name of the proposal speaks by itself, Product Liability Directive.

40:32.960 --> 40:37.760
The PLD, as we call it, is about the liability.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.520
So I'm going to tell you, give you some examples.

40:41.520 --> 40:46.800
Boeing 737 Max, two of them crashed some years ago.

40:46.800 --> 40:52.240
An autonomous vehicle that crashed and killed a person.

40:52.240 --> 41:03.480
In South Korea, a lawnmower that went into a person, your mobile phone that overheats.

41:03.480 --> 41:07.760
All of these situations are what we call the liability.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.840
And all of them include softwares.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.560
So what Benjamin explained to you are the obligation that when you want to place your

41:16.560 --> 41:22.200
product in the union on the market, but when something goes wrong, someone has to pay the

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
bill.

41:23.200 --> 41:28.080
This is how every system works in all countries.

41:28.080 --> 41:35.240
And what the product liability does tells you who is the liable person and what the

41:35.240 --> 41:39.960
victim has to show to claim the compensation.

41:39.960 --> 41:45.720
So the regime of the PLD exists since 1985.

41:45.720 --> 41:50.800
But as you know, the product of 1985 were not the one that we have today, including

41:50.800 --> 41:55.600
software, AI systems, IoT, et cetera.

41:55.600 --> 42:04.920
So what we have done is to redraft and re-clarify the regime that existed by including all softwares

42:04.920 --> 42:06.200
in it.

42:06.200 --> 42:12.840
Because as you know, and with the example that I gave to you, software can in some situation

42:12.840 --> 42:15.600
cause harm and cause a damage.

42:15.600 --> 42:22.800
So what the PLD does, and it says that the manufacturer is liable for damage caused by

42:22.800 --> 42:25.360
defect in their product.

42:25.360 --> 42:33.760
And the injured person, so in a tribunal or in a court, has to prove the damage, the existence

42:33.760 --> 42:41.600
of the damage, the defect in the product, and the link, what we in legal terms call

42:41.600 --> 42:46.640
the cause of relationship between the defect and the damage itself.

42:46.640 --> 42:52.480
If this is proved, the manufacturer has to compensate the victim or the family of the

42:52.480 --> 42:54.320
victim in case of death.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.680
So the manufacturer is defined.

42:56.680 --> 43:03.520
This is a definition that appears in all legislation, product legislation in the union.

43:03.520 --> 43:06.520
The damage, what damages are we talking about?

43:06.520 --> 43:10.880
Death, personal injury, damage to property.

43:10.880 --> 43:14.880
Think about an IoT boiler system in your house.

43:14.880 --> 43:19.520
Over hits, the house explodes, someone has to pay for that.

43:19.520 --> 43:23.760
That's a simple situation, but at least you see exactly what we're talking about.

43:23.760 --> 43:27.880
Data loss, data corruption, this is a new addition.

43:27.880 --> 43:34.880
So obviously the liability that you had until now covered any physical things, but as you

43:34.880 --> 43:38.840
know, you own stuff, even in the material world.

43:38.840 --> 43:43.840
When you talk about NFTs, why would you be covered if your painting burns because of

43:43.840 --> 43:51.280
your house, the explosion, let's say, or whatever, but you cannot get compensation if actually

43:51.280 --> 43:53.320
you lose your NFT?

43:53.320 --> 43:57.360
So all of this has been re-adapted and included in the regime.

43:57.360 --> 44:02.960
So these are the damages for which the manufacturer has to pay compensation in case there was

44:02.960 --> 44:07.880
a defect that caused the damage to one of them.

44:07.880 --> 44:12.600
So the entire notion of defect, and I'm going to try to explain a bit also what was the

44:12.600 --> 44:22.200
part of the revision, the entire idea of defect is that the product did not, let's say, had

44:22.200 --> 44:27.480
a lack of safety that a general person is expected to have.

44:27.480 --> 44:31.640
So your fire alarm does not detect the smoke.

44:31.640 --> 44:35.600
You are expecting that it would actually do it.

44:35.600 --> 44:43.360
If you have a computer and actually the software has so many vulnerabilities that you lose

44:43.360 --> 44:47.140
any of your data, you might expect that actually should not do it.

44:47.140 --> 44:52.200
So all of these are normally explained in quotes, and if you establish that there was

44:52.200 --> 44:57.400
a defect and that there was damage, then you get compensation.

44:57.400 --> 45:03.280
Defect does not mean that we're talking about a zero absence of bugs in a software, for

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
instance.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.760
That's not what it means.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.560
Zero, it's impossible.

45:07.560 --> 45:08.900
You cannot have it.

45:08.900 --> 45:15.000
But you can have vulnerabilities that as a developer you should have expected or you

45:15.000 --> 45:16.760
should have foreseen.

45:16.760 --> 45:21.960
So all of these elements are taken into account to establish the liability of the manufacturer

45:21.960 --> 45:27.920
or manufacturer developer depends on which type of product we are talking about.

45:27.920 --> 45:35.000
So as I said, the liability has been revised, there are different adaptations of the regime

45:35.000 --> 45:40.640
for liability, the digital age, circular economy, this is about the substantial modification

45:40.640 --> 45:42.360
that we're talking about.

45:42.360 --> 45:48.400
The global value chains, this is a concept that we talk mostly in trade where a product

45:48.400 --> 45:54.860
comes from outside of the union, the manufacturer is established outside of the union and brings

45:54.860 --> 45:56.200
the product in the union.

45:56.200 --> 45:59.840
So you need to know who is the liable one.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.060
And then a better protection for victims.

46:03.060 --> 46:11.440
So basically what the new proposal or the new product liability directive proposed is

46:11.440 --> 46:17.160
to say that any software is a product, no matter how it's supplied or provided.

46:17.160 --> 46:21.920
So this obviously also includes any AI systems.

46:21.920 --> 46:27.120
No matter if it's a software as a service or anything that will be concerned as a service,

46:27.120 --> 46:32.160
all of them are software and all of them are products and all of them will be covered by

46:32.160 --> 46:34.160
the liability.

46:34.160 --> 46:37.960
But at the same time you also know that software do not work independently.

46:37.960 --> 46:46.000
You have what we call the digital service, the flow of data that feeds the your AI system

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
for the training.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.600
All of them will be covered and all of the providers of those data, for instance, will

46:52.600 --> 46:57.960
be also covered by the liability in case something goes wrong.

46:57.960 --> 47:02.040
As we talk about already, there is the exception of open source software outside of a commercial

47:02.040 --> 47:03.520
activity.

47:03.520 --> 47:10.120
To be clear, outside of a commercial activity is the exception for any product.

47:10.120 --> 47:14.340
If a product is outside of a commercial activity, it's out.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.280
But what is a commercial activity?

47:16.280 --> 47:22.880
Well, if your software is sold, this is a commercial activity.

47:22.880 --> 47:28.680
If you provide services to the company that takes your open source software, this is a

47:28.680 --> 47:30.200
commercial activity.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.160
Those are examples of commercial activity.

47:33.160 --> 47:36.920
This is how it has been interpreted by the court.

47:36.920 --> 47:42.040
This is part of the court judgments and case law.

47:42.040 --> 47:48.680
You will have different situations, but these are some examples that I gave to you.

47:48.680 --> 47:52.080
The damages to data loss and corruption.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.840
The software updates and upgrades.

47:54.840 --> 48:02.000
Obviously your software or any type of product that are digital evolved during their lifetime.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.280
This has also to be taken into account.

48:04.280 --> 48:10.840
If you do not provide a software update or upgrade that was necessary to avoid the damage,

48:10.840 --> 48:12.800
you can be held liable.

48:12.800 --> 48:18.880
These are the different elements, but obviously I will not go into absolute details.

48:18.880 --> 48:23.920
Addressing the cyber vulnerabilities might also open a claim for damages.

48:23.920 --> 48:31.720
The evolution of an AI system through machine learning could also open a claim if the machine

48:31.720 --> 48:33.600
creates any damage.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.700
So that's a bit of the adaptation.

48:36.700 --> 48:41.560
The circular economy is the general concept of substantial modification.

48:41.560 --> 48:47.400
So obviously if someone substantially modifies a product, in this case a software, it should

48:47.400 --> 48:52.480
be the one who should be held liable if something happens, has a manufacturer or the developer

48:52.480 --> 48:58.680
of this software after he has done the substantial modification.

48:58.680 --> 49:05.600
The value chain is more related to the traders that imports the product in the union.

49:05.600 --> 49:12.520
As a victim you should not be blocked just because you do not know who is the manufacturer

49:12.520 --> 49:13.520
of the product.

49:13.520 --> 49:20.320
So anyone who is part of the value chain that brought the product in the union can be held

49:20.320 --> 49:21.320
liable.

49:21.320 --> 49:28.520
So through an importer, if you buy through an online marketplace, those entities could

49:28.520 --> 49:31.280
be held liable instead of the manufacturer.

49:31.280 --> 49:36.360
And then obviously if they have contract with the manufacturer itself, they can have recourse

49:36.360 --> 49:39.800
against him.

49:39.800 --> 49:48.560
The better protection, it's more for technical points, but it's how it's going to work in

49:48.560 --> 49:50.220
courts.

49:50.220 --> 49:53.480
You have situations that are so complicated.

49:53.480 --> 49:58.240
Let's take an AI system, explaining where the defect is in an AI system might be complex

49:58.240 --> 50:01.140
as a victim to show.

50:01.140 --> 50:06.640
So we created what we called in legal terms legal presumptions.

50:06.640 --> 50:12.400
If you have one of the, if the victim can prove one of those elements, you have what

50:12.400 --> 50:14.040
we call the presumption.

50:14.040 --> 50:19.280
So we presume that the product is defective and it has caused the damage.

50:19.280 --> 50:25.620
And if it's the case, then it is to the manufacturer to explain that actually it is not the case.

50:25.620 --> 50:33.180
So that is a legal tool that exists in every system, but we have adapted it to ensure that

50:33.180 --> 50:38.580
if something goes wrong, someone at least has a possibility to have a claim.

50:38.580 --> 50:41.520
It does not mean that you're liable.

50:41.520 --> 50:48.080
It just means that you can bring a claim to a court and make your case and explain why

50:48.080 --> 50:53.800
the product was defective and why you have a damage and why the manufacturer should be

50:53.800 --> 50:55.120
held liable.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.040
This is not an automatic situation.

50:57.040 --> 51:03.280
It's not because we have included software, for instance, in the scope of the legislation,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.200
that it means that you will be held liable.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.500
You need to have a damage.

51:06.500 --> 51:10.920
You need to have a plane that crashes because of the software that obliged the pilot to

51:10.920 --> 51:14.000
go down instead, to go up.

51:14.000 --> 51:20.080
The autonomous vehicle that goes into a wall, why there was nothing on the road.

51:20.080 --> 51:25.280
Those kinds of situations are the ones that at least allow a victim to make the claim

51:25.280 --> 51:29.280
and go in court and try to get the compensation.

51:29.280 --> 51:34.520
If the product was not defective, well, then there is no problem.

51:34.520 --> 51:41.480
And again, when we talk about software, this is not a zero bug that we're talking about.

51:41.480 --> 51:46.440
We are talking about expectation that you have about the software, the fact that your

51:46.440 --> 51:54.920
software should not overheat your boiler, the fact that the pilot, the software pilot

51:54.920 --> 51:59.120
in your plane should not push down while you're trying to go up.

51:59.120 --> 52:03.520
Those kinds of things, these are the situations that we're talking about.

52:03.520 --> 52:07.160
So these are a bit of technical situations.

52:07.160 --> 52:13.520
But we have what we call a disclosure of information.

52:13.520 --> 52:18.320
Only the manufacturer of the product itself knows the product.

52:18.320 --> 52:27.840
So as a victim, you need to have access to some sort of information, like the data used,

52:27.840 --> 52:34.680
any kind of evidences that could be of an help to create the claim.

52:34.680 --> 52:39.240
Obviously those information are protected by trade secrets.

52:39.240 --> 52:44.800
This is not a way of giving away your secrets.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.360
They are protected through courts.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.280
They are systems.

52:48.280 --> 52:56.680
We have years and years of practice in national system, in tribunal, to know exactly what

52:56.680 --> 53:01.280
can be showed, how can it be showed, and what to protect.

53:01.280 --> 53:08.120
But there should be an access to the necessary information for that.

53:08.120 --> 53:16.760
And finally, this is a bit of the small details that have been changed.

53:16.760 --> 53:22.760
There was a ceiling before for claims, before you could not get more than 70 million.

53:22.760 --> 53:26.840
I mean, we're not talking about every claim will be 70 million.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.600
Let's put it like this.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.480
But there was a ceiling cap.

53:30.480 --> 53:32.080
This has been removed.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.640
Nothing explained that you should limit it in number of money.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.240
There was a threshold.

53:38.240 --> 53:44.840
If your damage was less than 500 euros, you could not have any claim for liability.

53:44.840 --> 53:51.640
And then the liability as a time period, you're not liable for 300 years.

53:51.640 --> 53:57.280
You're liable for 10 years after putting on the market your product.

53:57.280 --> 54:01.840
After that, you cannot be held liable under these rules.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.960
But there is a time limitation.

54:04.960 --> 54:13.520
This allows to predict and to ensure the risk of your business, if it's a business, or of

54:13.520 --> 54:15.680
your product.

54:15.680 --> 54:20.440
And there has been a small adaptation for personal injuries.

54:20.440 --> 54:25.080
This is typical for some specific product like pharmaceutical products where the damage

54:25.080 --> 54:27.280
appears after.

54:27.280 --> 54:33.040
I mean, I didn't go into all the details, but the product liability does not apply only

54:33.040 --> 54:34.280
to software.

54:34.280 --> 54:35.840
It's one of the products.

54:35.840 --> 54:42.080
We're talking about cars, cars, pharmaceutical products, all of them.

54:42.080 --> 54:48.480
So any damage that any of those products will cause, you would have a claim for compensation.

54:48.480 --> 54:51.480
So that's it from me.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.000
Thank you very much.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.920
I hope there was not too technical.

54:58.920 --> 55:02.640
Thank you, Omar.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.040
We're going to go now to the panel.

55:05.040 --> 55:10.520
And I will introduce James Lovegrove from Red Hat, our policy director.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.880
Who will be the moderator?

55:12.880 --> 55:19.720
So I'm giving the mic to James.

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
Very good.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.720
Welcome, everyone.

55:22.720 --> 55:26.040
I appreciate that we're halfway through the session.

55:26.040 --> 55:31.200
So if you want to stand up and then sit down and stretch your arms, that's fine.

55:31.200 --> 55:38.400
So in terms of the first time we came, yesterday we had the policy summit brought together

55:38.400 --> 55:42.800
a couple hundred people in person and hundreds more online, I understand.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.760
But what's interesting is only five, six years ago when we started it in earnest, as the

55:46.760 --> 55:52.240
OFEs in the crowd, there was literally, I see Talo was there, there were sort of 14,

55:52.240 --> 55:53.440
15 people in the room.

55:53.440 --> 55:58.920
So I mean, that massive scaling is interesting in the sense of response to the growth of

55:58.920 --> 56:06.640
EU policy impacting digital ecosystems, open source included, but also the intent and realization

56:06.640 --> 56:12.400
that as a community of open source practitioners, further collaboration and coordination is

56:12.400 --> 56:13.800
absolutely essential.

56:13.800 --> 56:17.880
I think today is a good example where the Commission sees that as well.

56:17.880 --> 56:24.000
We're joined today by three members of the European Commission, from Digit, from Grow,

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
from Connect.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.800
And frankly, I think they're worth a shout out and a round of applause.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.320
It's a big deal having them here.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.320
Thank you.

56:31.320 --> 56:36.400
All right.

56:36.400 --> 56:41.080
So I mean, music to our ears, Benjamin made it really clear up there, he mentioned rationale

56:41.080 --> 56:44.040
to exclude non-commercial open source.

56:44.040 --> 56:52.640
So the door is open, the ears are open, but this is a complex process.

56:52.640 --> 56:56.520
Yesterday we were talking about the analogy of trains leaving stations and so forth, and

56:56.520 --> 56:58.560
yeah, it's now en route.

56:58.560 --> 57:03.280
That's going through quite a complex co-regulatory process.

57:03.280 --> 57:07.560
And as a community, we don't have the resources in many cases to actually keep up with that.

57:07.560 --> 57:13.880
So again, this kind of collaboration is absolutely critical if we're going to reflect that rationale

57:13.880 --> 57:17.640
of best practices when it comes to open source, but also best practice in terms of the tools

57:17.640 --> 57:20.760
that we're talking about into the law, into the practice.

57:20.760 --> 57:26.920
Otherwise, there will be unintended consequences, and I think nobody wants to hear that.

57:26.920 --> 57:34.040
I think the final point I want to make just before I hand over to our first panelist is

57:34.040 --> 57:40.440
that even if we get the open source exclusion and some of the clarity into the text and

57:40.440 --> 57:46.880
the articles around open source, it's still kind of half of the journey.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.120
And I think that's important just to underscore.

57:49.120 --> 57:55.460
There are still elements which need further discussion, how they practically impact this

57:55.460 --> 57:59.640
extraordinary ecosystem.

57:59.640 --> 58:04.700
And I think without further ado, I'm going to hand over to Zoe, who is the senior policy

58:04.700 --> 58:06.920
manager from Digital Europe.

58:06.920 --> 58:11.840
I'll let her introduce what the organization does and who it represents, but it's a big

58:11.840 --> 58:17.780
deal when it comes to engaging with EU policymakers, both here in Brussels but across the union,

58:17.780 --> 58:22.640
and it's great to have her here to let us know what Digital Europe thinks about this.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.640
Thanks.

58:23.640 --> 58:28.880
Thank you, James.

58:28.880 --> 58:33.760
Thanks a lot, everyone, and indeed, many thanks to the organizers of the panel, but also to

58:33.760 --> 58:35.520
the Commission.

58:35.520 --> 58:39.880
We also do really appreciate that you always take the time, and I know how much effort

58:39.880 --> 58:42.400
you are putting on this legislation.

58:42.400 --> 58:47.360
So Digital Europe is an industry trade association.

58:47.360 --> 58:53.920
For those that don't know, we represent the tech industry that is active in Europe, but

58:53.920 --> 59:00.800
we also obviously represent both global actors from across all regions that they are doing

59:00.800 --> 59:03.280
business in the tech industry in Europe.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.380
And we have two chambers of members.

59:05.380 --> 59:10.440
We have the corporate ones, and we also have the national trade associations.

59:10.440 --> 59:14.600
This gives us an outlook on both the global scale of things, but also on the national

59:14.600 --> 59:15.600
level.

59:15.600 --> 59:23.280
We also represent trade associations, including SMEs, for example.

59:23.280 --> 59:28.240
So why are we here?

59:28.240 --> 59:35.240
That's because we think that the Cyber Resilience Act is one of the most pivotal legislation

59:35.240 --> 59:36.640
that we are going to have.

59:36.640 --> 59:40.120
Well, now we're this funded, but in general, it's a trendsetter.

59:40.120 --> 59:42.320
It's a very, very important legislation.

59:42.320 --> 59:48.920
At Digital Europe, we do sort of internal search to see what is important for our members

59:48.920 --> 59:56.240
to make sure that our resources are allocated accordingly, and AI, data, and the Cyber Resilience

59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.920
Act have been ranked as the three highest priorities for the digital industry.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:08.360
So I just want to emphasize again how important this legislation is, and thank again the organizers

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.520
for really taking the time to highlight this.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.800
Now I think it's probably one of the first times that the industry and NGOs really agree.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:24.040
So Martin's presentation was very interesting, and I noted down many of the points that we

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.160
also highlight in our position.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:32.520
I also want to take a moment to say that you probably wonder, especially the open source

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:39.320
community, you wonder why the industry, the big tech or multinationals, why do they care

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.360
about the open source community?

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.460
So actually, I just wanted to clarify that for us, it's very, very important to make

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.960
sure that the open source community is not overburdened by this legislation.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:00.680
For many of our members, even up to 100% of their commercial products have relied on open

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.200
source components, and just like James said, there are many priorities, many things that

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.080
we can improve at the CRA, but not overburdening the open source community is one of our top

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.760
priorities as well.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:21.120
So it is also important to note that it's a bit of a stereotype to think that the big

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:26.400
tech companies, for example, they only rely on closed source and they don't care about

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.640
the open source community, but I want to highlight that for us, it is very, very high important

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:37.320
to make this a key priority for the CRA to have clarity on what this means for the open

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.920
source community.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:46.400
So I'm not going to repeat too much myself because you already said it, Recital10 excludes

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.440
open source, and we very much welcome this.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.640
And in general, we welcome the legislation.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.080
It's a very good draft.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.640
It's something we can really work with, and we need it.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640
We can start from that.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.400
We all agree, also the private sector, that we absolutely need these type of requirements.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.720
So we are very willing to find a way together that makes it work, but we really need to

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.240
get it right.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.080
Including too much, too soon, can also be very damaging.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.580
So for open source, there is the conundrum of it's excluded, but not really.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:25.880
So the text says that it's not in, but then when you look at the commercial element of

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:32.120
it, and if you look at the definition of what commercial is under the blue guide of the

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:37.520
new legislative framework, it says that commercial is understood as providing goods in a business-related

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.720
context.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.160
So what does this mean for the open source community?

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.920
What does a business context mean?

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:50.120
Because like I said before, many of the commercial products rely on open source components.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.200
So we need clarity.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.400
Right now, if you look at the document, there are 85 pages.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.260
Commercial is mentioned only twice, and there is no definition.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:05.360
But this brings me to the bigger element, the issue of the proposal that we really see.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.800
One, we really welcome the fact that the NLF is the approach that is chosen.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.160
Benjamin did a great job explaining the NLF and the C marking and everything related tangible

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.160
products.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:26.360
That is now, the big quest right now is how to move a regime that has been so working

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.680
very well, we think, for tangible products.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.640
But now, the biggest challenge is the CRA wants to transform this regime into something

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:40.640
that is workable for software, which is, again, very welcome, because NLF has proven to be

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.840
the right way to do things.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.760
But we really need to work more on the definitions.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.080
So commercial is just one way, one example.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.760
Then there are other examples, like components.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.680
In Article 11, when it comes to reporting, it says that manufacturers have to also report

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:09.000
on vulnerabilities, including soft open source components in paragraph 7.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
So the question there is, what does a component mean in the context of the software as well?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.760
So this is a general comment on how we really need to work together to transform NLF into

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.480
something that makes sense for software.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.840
This is why at Digital Europe, we have been really advocating for a clear provision asking

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.720
the Commission to develop guidelines that are specifically, that they adapt to the specificities

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:43.160
of software, and specifically, standalone software, with the inclusion of the industry.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.040
Because what we see here is that the people that are going to actually have to abide by

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.520
the new compliance rules, the industry players, are not really included in the draft in the

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.600
sense that we really want to be part of an expert group, that we are going to help the

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.900
Commission that we know has the appetite to do this right.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.200
But we bring the experience, and we bring the questions also.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200
What does this mean?

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.200
What does placement of the market for software, for example, mean?

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.400
What does substantial modification mean?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400
Modification, sorry.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.040
So all these things, we, I think the important thing is that we all see the, we have the

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.300
appetite, but it still needs to be clarified in the text.

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:24.080
And maybe just as a final point, all these things need time.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.760
And I really welcome the question before on standardization.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:36.360
We appreciate that 90% of the products rely on self-assessment and when existing harmonized

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.560
standards are there.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.240
But we also need to look at what does this 10% mean for critical products?

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.880
Have we actually made an assessment of how much of the burden is for third party conformity,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.760
for example, are notified, but is ready?

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.080
So this all means that we need time to get it right.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:04.520
The current proposal says 24 months for implementation for the development of harmonized standards,

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.880
sorry, and for the development process is just too little.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.780
And I think this is probably something we are more or less aligned on, that we need

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.780
more time.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.520
And for us, the proposal is 48 months, but I know this is something we will discuss further

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.520
with the Commission and with the collaborators.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520
Okay.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.320
So I don't want to go into more.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.660
There's way more there.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:33.040
Just as a final comment, even if, as James said, even if we get the open source exclusion

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:39.000
right, there are several things that need to work in the whole context of software,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
including reporting obligations.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.120
The right timelines right now, it says 24 hours for initial notification, but we want

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.280
it to be aligned fully with a needs directive because we think it's just introducing too

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.840
many processes, it's just too much.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.360
And yeah, I mean, I don't want to go too much into more details because James is giving

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.320
me a smile that says that I've talked too much.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.080
Thank you very much.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.080
Thank you, Zoe.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080
Well done.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:16.880
So I'm going to now turn to Rom, a colleague of mine.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:23.360
As you know, Red Hat is an upstream first pure play open source software company.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:28.640
And therefore Rom spends a lot of his time, maybe a lot of, most of his time upstream

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.760
as a volunteer, as a developer, as a contributor.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.600
So I'd be interested in hearing your perspective.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:43.280
As Martin was mentioning, he has a particular perspective on it from DNS and now the sort

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.280
of wider, larger ecosystems that are involved in the kinds of products and projects that

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.240
Red Hat's involved in.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:56.720
And to Omar's point earlier about just getting real on zero bugs being impossible in the

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.480
context of PLD, I think that's an important point to underscore and something which, you

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:06.640
know, the no known vulnerabilities implications for open source or even for proprietary, not

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:11.720
so much proprietary, but nonetheless, it is important to have that, recognize that the

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.000
commission understands that, but it needs reflecting, as I say, in the text to make

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.800
sure that clarity is clear.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.040
So Rom, I'm going to come over to you and give you the microphone.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040
Thank you.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:30.920
Yeah, so we are in a unique position at Red Hat of being a large contributor for the open

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:36.200
source and if you look at the portfolio of product that we have, I think we're depending

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:41.560
and contributing to about more than a million different open source projects.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.320
That's the level of contribution.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:53.160
One particular example that James was mentioning is the look at critical systems, but also

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:59.120
critical products like credentials and the zero bug.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.000
We all know that zero bug policy is impossible to achieve and I'm really glad that Omar

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.480
underlined this.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:13.000
But the reality is that if we don't have clear definition about this, it's going to slow

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.240
down so much contribution, so much innovation that we have.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:23.320
We already see that through the lens of our internal folks and myself for some project

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:29.320
that I'm working on from communities, maybe you know communities, with the Special Interest

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.760
Group for authentication and key management system.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.640
There's a lot of people scared there.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:47.720
Because we're looking into putting into, I would say into the product, new features that

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:54.960
we deem interesting and we truly believe that it will be a game changer for the community

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.560
and putting a product in production.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:05.760
But in the meantime, we are really scared because we are not able to make a full interrupt

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.840
compatibility assessment with all the different projects.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.280
As I said, one million projects.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:19.960
Can you imagine if you start having the need to go through the full cycle of integration

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.960
and testing for this?

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.200
We try to do it at Red Hat.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.480
And that's sometimes the reason why when you look at the difference between what you find

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:38.880
in the community with Fedora, or doing a bit of marketing now, about Fedora or SenseOS or

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.240
I would say OKD, you will see that there's a major gap between what we have there, which

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.720
is like top edge cutting edge solution versus what we have in the product because we have

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.760
that we're scared about it.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Not scared in the sense that we don't want to give innovation, but we are scared about

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.560
what would be the end goal, the end results if we are becoming responsible also for some

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.520
breaches.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:12.920
With credentials and the work I'm doing on contributing actually because we are about

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:20.360
112% working on this.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.640
We look into this perspective, this lens of compliance and regulation and no later than

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:35.000
yesterday I was in one of our company events where we had 1200 techy people, we were interested

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.080
in technology and we were discussing a group of 60 there about this.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.920
And that's the moment some people were like oh I'm not going to touch this, I don't want

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.300
to be responsible for this.

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:52.520
So we need more clarity, we need more understanding, so when we see the law and that's what I would

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:59.560
really love to have, it's to have more like a framework where we can share this with the

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:08.960
community and make sure that we can put straight upstream those perspective, those regulation

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:16.640
compliance perspective so that you guys are not afraid of contributing to any top notch

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.640
cutting edge solutions.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.220
Credential is one of them.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:28.080
If you know a bit of communities, you know that it's nothing related to password managers,

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.320
but as soon as you're using secrets with communities then it becomes a password manager and it's

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.960
a critical class one product then.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:44.120
So it's those kind of things that nobody can think about but we need to get that into perspective

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.860
so we understand what needs to happen then in the product.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:53.880
So there's specific elements to take care and there's a cycle of work that is really,

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.640
I was going to say burden but we all know that when we do software we need to go through

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.980
a secure supply chain.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:07.560
This is the buzzword of 2022 and 2023 but it's a reality and I like to comment about

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.460
the ISO part.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.760
There's so many different ways to standardize this.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.800
There's so many ways, there's the best practices from an industry standpoint.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:25.540
There's guide, I think the EU has the blue guide also where you can have some guidelines.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:31.720
So there's different ways to approach this but it's an ethical responsibility to apply

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:39.200
it and sometimes, well, we are so carry on with our innovation that we forget about it.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.700
We're like, oh, we should do it like this.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.040
And so that's the other side.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.380
I'm really worried about the regulation but in the meantime I'm really happy that there's

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:54.440
something there to enforce us straight from the beginning to have this secure supply chain

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.440
in perspective.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.440
That's for me actually.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.880
Great thanks, Rom.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.580
I think one of the things I took from that is, and I think this penny is dropping not

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:16.080
just in this room but elsewhere, is that software is fungible and I think some of the terms

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:26.480
in the draft regulation around intended purpose around calling from my son, probably not a

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:35.200
good time by Sam, in terms of intended purpose, reasonably foreseeable, any known or foreseeable

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.680
circumstances, I think that's something which gives open source reports for concern.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:47.480
And I think one of the reasons is, coming from an open source licensing perspective,

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:53.280
is that bringing that community together is not just a question of passion to solve problems

01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:00.200
and build out open innovation in Europe but also to be shielded so developers do not incur

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.400
liability nor offer warranties.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.280
And I think that's something which is clearly important.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:13.200
And actually it's a good segue to Ghes because in his capacity at Digit in the open source

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:23.360
program office, the EUPL is one of such license which again is important to open source contributors

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
and collaborators.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:33.360
So I'd be interested to hear more from your perspective, and understand from your thoughts

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.960
on this particular topic.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.000
Thanks.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.080
Thank you, and it's very good to be back at Fosten, people.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.680
I think we all agree.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:47.600
This legislation of course also impacts the Commission open source projects.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:54.120
So we're looking forward to figuring out how to work on this.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.400
To give you a bit of perspective, so I talk on behalf of the European Commission's open

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:04.280
source program office, and going to quote the words from Deborah Bryant yesterday, where

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:11.200
basically for you an easy to find, easy to access way to find out who to talk to amongst

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.200
our colleagues.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.200
We will do the leg work.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.480
We'll find out who we should put you in touch with.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.400
We'll find out who to talk to.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.400
And we will liaise when necessary between the Commission policymakers and the open source

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400
community.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.640
So that's one thing I can promise you, we'll try and make this happen.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.600
A little bit about the OSPO, James.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.120
Is that okay as context?

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:42.440
So we started in 2020 thanks to a communication from the Commission to itself about an open

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:48.760
source strategy that recognized that if the Commission wants to reach its political goals,

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.800
it needs to basically take into account that in everything there is software and in all

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.320
the major political goals, open source is a critical component.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:05.160
To be an industry, to be a European market, to be active in innovation, to be active in

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:10.480
competition, open source is there and it can't be taken out.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:18.680
One of the first things we did as OSPO is make it super easy for the Commission to disseminate

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.480
its open source process.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.600
So far, previously it was a paperwork process that would take six months.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:30.600
Now it is basically up to the project to decide we want to go open and we have a code repository,

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.160
code.europa.tu, which now has some 200 projects, some 700 users.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:42.840
This is from the Commission, from IESMA, from DG Connect, from JRC, from the European Central

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.680
Bank, from the EDPS.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.360
So you should check that out and maybe start working on some of these solutions.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.120
This also shows that we will be impacted because we're pulling in an enormous amount of open

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:59.200
source to build these components.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.680
Another thing that I think is good for you to realize is that we're, as a Commission

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.400
OSPO, in touch with OSPOs in the member states.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.520
Some of them are here.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.160
I have my colleagues from Germany on the right for you on the left and the colleagues from

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.360
the Czech Republic on the left for me, so on the right for you.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.920
And we're in touch with these specifically for this kind of reasons.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:26.240
We need to network as OSPOs, we need to avoid making mistakes that others have made before

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.240
us and work as a group.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.680
I think I'll stop here.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680
It's a good introduction.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680
Very good.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680
Thanks, Gace.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:46.200
So I am conscious we have, if I'm right, another half an hour, 25 minutes.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.200
Is that right?

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.320
10 till 10.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.280
So I would like to give Benjamin the floor just to capture some of the thoughts I see

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280
you scribbling down.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.720
I hope I don't put you on the spot.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:02.520
But I'm sure some of them are familiar and it would be really good to hear from you on

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.520
those.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
Thanks.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.520
Great.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520
Thank you so much.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.680
Yeah, I mean, actually all the points are familiar to me.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.160
We are, of course, engaging a lot with stakeholders.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.360
And yeah, so I mean, as the Commission, we are now in a bit in a tricky position because

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.640
we made the proposal.

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.880
And it's, of course, the Commission's view that our own proposal is perfect the way it

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.480
is.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.880
That being said, it's the beginning of the journey.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.880
And I mean, it goes without saying that the Parliament and Council were closely looked

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.760
at the text and they're, of course, also consulting us a lot.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.160
And many of the things that have been mentioned here, they are being discussed by the Co-Legislator.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:50.840
So for example, this question of providing products with no known vulnerability.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.160
I mean, I can say that this is being discussed already by the Co-Legislators.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:01.120
And also, I mean, we've heard quite often already this concern that maybe the transition

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120
period is too short.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.120
I mean, we believe that 24 months is sufficient.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.680
But we hear this a lot from other stakeholders.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:13.720
So I mean, you can be sure that this is being all taken very seriously from us.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.720
Wonderful.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:26.760
Now, folks, it's really important that this community here in this room take this opportunity.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.120
It's not a speak now or forever, hold your peace.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.520
But it is a good opportunity.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:40.320
So if there are any who want to chime in a question, comment, that would be great.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.120
And then we're going to move back to the panel.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.000
Who's first?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.120
I think you're first.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.320
I already stole your mic.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.320
Sorry.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.320
Okay, go for it.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320
Can I borrow one?

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320
Please.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320
Go for it.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320
Okay.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320
Sorry.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320
So I'll try to be brief, but there's a lot to say.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.080
So first I have to apologize because I feel about this.

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.720
So I will be carried away.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.720
Sorry.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.480
Nothing I'm going to say is meant to be offensive to the Commission.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.040
Actually I think that many of the recent attacks are very good for the internet industry, for

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.320
the internet, like the digital market side.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:16.360
So the criticism will not be meant as a rejection of regulation.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:23.000
So my perspective, I'm a software developer and the head of policy for OpenExchange, which

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.260
is a German open source software maker of around 270 people.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:31.440
So I'd say that we are small compared to the big tech industries globally.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.080
But we are still one of the biggest.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.240
So we are also one of the companies that I mean, we make stuff that is in every Linux

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.320
distribution like Davco.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.480
And so we care about security.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.960
We are ISO certified, ISO 27.1.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960
We do this.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.640
So we are among those that could afford to follow everything that's in the CRI and would

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.140
do that.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.880
But we are part of an ecosystem.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.920
And so we feel the need to, I mean, also bring the perspective of others, including some

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.840
smaller projects that we use in our own projects.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.640
And the problem with this regulation is, well, there are multiple problems.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.920
Let's start from the non-commercial exemption.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.480
So there isn't really no way that you can tell commercial projects from non-commercial

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:14.800
projects because each and every project, except maybe like my hobby project, which I only

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.120
do for myself and publish somewhere, has some economic result, creates value.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.160
And there will be people using it to create further value.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.920
And so it is basically very hard to write a non-ambiguous way to tell commercial from

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.160
non-commercial.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.960
And all projects, including like, I mean, search centers like in the net universities

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.720
need some money to get at least donations.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.680
So there is no way you can tell this.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.920
And on the other hand, I would also be against in saying that all open source software is

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.880
exempt from this regulation because I'm sure that the proprietary software makers would

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.560
come and say, you know, as they have been saying for 20 years, open source is just a

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.600
toy, it's just a hobby project, so you should use proprietary software which is secure.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.680
So don't do that.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:01.520
The problem is really that this law doesn't seem to understand how software works.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.980
I mean, software, pure software, material products have a nature which is significantly

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.160
different than any physical product with software in it.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.920
So this regulation seems to be designed with cars in demand, with toys, with IoT devices,

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.760
but not for pure software.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.280
Pure software is more similar to literature in a way.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.200
It's something that is the result of collective development.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:26.880
And if you have a look at open source projects, yes, we are the manufacturers of Davco.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.400
But if you look at the code, it's written by people everywhere on the planet.

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.400
So yes, but the real authors are maybe like a thousand people which are in Europe, outside

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.880
of Europe, everywhere.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.760
And so your law seems to put the burden of putting a CE mark on every line of code which

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.080
is imported into Europe.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.960
I don't even know what that means.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.440
We have repositories.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.360
Maybe they are in Europe, they are mirrored in the US.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.000
There are people from Australia and from China putting code into it.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.640
And this code is traveling all over the world throughout the borders of the European Union

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:57.760
several times per second.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.960
So should I every time I check some code, I mean, someone should stop the code at the

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.280
border and put the CE mark.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.280
This doesn't really make any sense.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.240
It's simply impossible.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:13.240
And it is to say, I mean, all the people here, I mean, your law is designed for the traditional

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:17.280
20th century way of making things in which there's a manufacturer and there's a distributor

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.440
and someone that sells them in a shop and then there's the use of the consumer.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.520
I mean, like if we were still buying, sorry, I'm trying to be sure, but I know you want

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.720
to stop me, but I have to say this.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:33.840
And so it seems designed for the time when we went to the shop to media markets and bought

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.600
Windows 95 in a box on a CD.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.560
And this is not how it works.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.040
Everyone here is at the same time a manufacturer, a distributor, an importer and a user of code.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.640
And there's no way you can distinguish these roles.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.080
So you have to find something.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.080
You have to find somewhere.

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.600
So I know I can cut it short.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.040
So I don't understand the problem you're trying to solve.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.160
Show me one case in which a European piece of open source software had a problem that,

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.240
I mean, created issues with the entire world and how this could be solved by this regulation.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.320
Because if you just maybe funded some security audits for projects that cannot afford them,

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.440
this would make a much bigger effect.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.760
So let's start again discussing from software for something specific from software, because

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.160
this really is not working.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.160
Thank you.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.160
Thank you.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:39.760
So I submitted the open form Europe document that Martin referenced.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.320
I probably have a dozen questions, but I picked one.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.640
So to publish software in the EU or to import software into the EU, the publisher must perform

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.360
CRA certification and accept CRA obligations.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.760
This means that software from outside the EU will no longer be available in the EU if

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.160
those developers do not perform CRA certification or accept CRA obligations.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.840
How is that not a massive problem?

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840
Yeah.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.840
But really, really quick.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.840
There's always...

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:07.840
Yeah, okay.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.840
Yeah.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:18.560
I think my understanding is one of the goals of the CRA...

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:19.560
Close.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.560
Close.

01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:21.560
Hi.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.480
I think my understanding is one of the goals of the CRA is to avoid log4j or open SSL type

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480
of incidents.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:30.640
But they are non-commercial open source software.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:37.220
And when we exclude them from CRA, we are technically not addressing these cases.

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.680
So what do you think about this?

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:47.320
As a solution, what do you think about expanding the proposal to set up necessary operational,

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:54.400
financial assistance dedicated to the critical open source initiatives?

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.480
Maybe especially the EU ones, maybe European OSPO.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:04.520
Is that feasible?

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.520
Thank you, Alex.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.520
Thanks.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:09.960
Thanks for the insights and thanks for the panel.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.640
I mean, I have two questions.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.840
We have a lot of problems.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.280
But I'm interested in solutions.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.880
So first, what's your proposal to fix this commercial term?

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.560
So do we have one?

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560
Could you let us know?

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.080
And the second one, to the Commission.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.040
So do you see the issue like NLnet?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.480
So would you consider charities to be affected by this definition or not?

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.120
So what's the Commission take on the NLnet position?

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.120
Thank you.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.640
Thank you very much.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:51.560
And finally, we've known for a long time since David Wheeler wrote his paper stating that

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.560
all open source software is commercial.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.560
The word commercial is a bad word to use if you want to exclude open source.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:05.480
And so I recognize that it arises from the courts in Europe and from the Blue Book.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:12.920
But have you considered using different terminology to solve the conflict that exists here because

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:18.440
of the nature of the community you're addressing rather than because of the context of the

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.960
existing legislation?

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:28.480
And secondly, which community organizations did you consult in working on both the PLD

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.360
and the CLA?

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.720
The panel is comprised purely of commercial organizations or commission members.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:41.360
And all of the questions you've received are from community charity representatives who

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.640
are in the audience and on the panel.

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.120
I wonder what you're going to do to fix this problem so that you don't get it with every

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.680
subsequent bill.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:50.680
Thank you.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:59.040
Can I?

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.800
Okay.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.800
Yeah.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800
Thanks a lot for all these questions.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.320
I mean, maybe first this one on who we consulted.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:15.080
So as a run-up to any commission proposal, there is a public consultation which runs

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.160
for three months.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.880
It's a period of three months where we ask a set of questions to the public and everyone

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.880
can respond to these questions, including you.

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:25.280
I mean, maybe you didn't know.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280
It's possible.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280
I understand that.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.280
Of course, we know, of course, very well that these public consultations, I mean, that big

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.480
players, commercial players, they are more paying attention to this because they have

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:38.120
the resources to do, though.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.560
And that's clear to us.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.040
But that's also, of course, one of the reasons why I'm here, right?

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:47.240
Because I know that this community, maybe the voice is not heard as much as the voice

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:52.040
of other communities.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:54.440
And as I said, we can, of course, keep engaging.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.440
You can come later.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.920
I can give you a card.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:57.920
And we can discuss.

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.880
We can even do maybe another small event and discuss further, right?

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.080
I mean, it's all possible.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.800
On this concept of commercial, so first, I mean, I think it would be very difficult for

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:14.360
us to replace it by another concept because it's well grounded in this new legislative

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.920
framework.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:21.280
And all the industry players that we've been speaking to so far, they all say they want

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.640
us to use the new legislative framework because they are familiar with it from other product

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.120
types, right?

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.040
So we want to ensure that all stakeholders can use the same framework.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.400
If we now invent a different framework, it will lead to a lot of fragmentation.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.640
It will make compliance more difficult for companies.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.120
So that would be difficult.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:45.800
Of course, I mean, there's this crucial question of where to draw the line of commercial.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.280
I think we are open to all your points.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.520
We understand them.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:55.240
I think what would, from our perspective, be very difficult, I mean, this is how I understood

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.320
your intervention, would be to say we just exclude all open source because it's all somewhat

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.560
commercial and it all needs to be excluded.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.560
I think this would not work simply for the fact because it would create an incentive

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.200
for proprietary manufacturers to switch over to open source, right?

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.960
Not everyone can do that.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960
You want that?

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960
Okay.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960
Okay.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:17.960
I see.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:21.720
No, but it would create an incentive to get out of the scope and to not have to comply,

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.720
right?

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.600
I don't think this is what you want.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.280
Then there was also a point from you on all the many small players and how it would be

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.400
maybe difficult for them to comply.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.620
So the cyber resilience act is, I mean, the requirements are risk-based.

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:40.080
That means that, I mean, when you're a very small player, there's also a chance that maybe

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.920
your project faces smaller risks and is maybe less critical.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.640
And you can take that into account when you comply with the requirements of the regulation.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:57.440
On top of that, for the vast majority of products, we only require self-attestation by the manufacturers,

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:02.400
which means you will not have to reach out to any third parties or interact with any

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.400
authorities.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.640
You can do it all by yourself.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.520
And this should be absolutely feasible.

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.160
What other questions did we have?

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:17.320
Yeah, there was this question of how the CRA would improve the ecosystem for components

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.480
that are vulnerable, such as log4j, where you said, I mean, this is a non-commercial

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.480
component.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:26.560
So, I mean, we have this due diligence obligation in our proposal.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:32.280
That means that in the future, when a commercial manufacturer integrates a product, for instance,

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:37.640
a logging utility that is free of charge available, they will have to make bigger effort than

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.240
today looking at these components.

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.320
I mean, that, again, of course, depends on the risk.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:47.600
I mean, if your project is low risk, you will only maybe check the change log if there are

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:51.280
regular security updates or not, and you're done with this assessment.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:55.800
But of course, if you integrate this component into something much more critical, you will

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:59.720
have to take a much more closer look at these components.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.400
So what we're trying to do is we're trying to make manufacturers of commercial products

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:10.440
proprietary or open source or whatever assume more responsibility for the open source components

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.440
that they're integrating.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:17.360
And we believe that this will help raise the level of security on these components as well.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:24.260
Yeah, there was this question on whether charities would be considered as a commercial activity.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.700
So I cannot just give you a straight answer on that.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.520
I think it always depends on the individual case, right?

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:35.600
I mean, what we've learned is that there are so many different types of open source projects,

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.240
so many different types of funding models.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.360
So you really need to look at each and every case to see if it's a commercial activity

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.360
or not.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.680
What I already said, I mean, as the commission, we are absolutely willing to provide more

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.160
clarity.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.240
This could be done, for instance, already in the legislative process that we single

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.360
out important examples and we provide clarity directly in the legal text.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.800
But for all these other niche cases that will come up, this will not be possible in the

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.520
text because we cannot, you know, a legal text needs to be short and concise and we

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:07.320
cannot take into account every single example.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:15.320
But we're absolutely prepared to provide examples once it has come into force so that you have

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:19.680
the certainty that you need to know whether you are in the scope or not with your project.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.280
I think I took them all.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:26.880
I think, yeah, of course.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:34.920
So for, I mean, I'm going to speak for the PLD, but for my proposal, we had expert groups

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:44.280
consultation in 2019, 18, 20, 21, consultation also through the contractor where they were

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.280
questioned through different kind of stakeholders.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.960
We had the consultation for when the proposal was adopted by the commission in September

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.600
2022 with the half-year C-POTO.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:03.720
This is where you find all the proposals and where you can give your comments on it.

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.120
And it was for more than three months for ours.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.280
So we always tried, obviously, to reach as much as possible.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.840
The thing is, obviously, there are sometimes channels.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.880
It's not that we avoid having talks with the people that can criticise the legislation.

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.560
We need critics to also make the legislation better.

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:25.640
This is how it works.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:33.080
So obviously, as you said, that, yeah, there might be some players that are more voiceable.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.360
This is the reality.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:41.560
I think it's also part of how the field or the ecosystem organised between itself.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:47.280
You need to have one speaker, someone that can represent also the community, because

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.400
obviously if we have someone that comes for the open source community that says that he's

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.560
speaking for the community, then he would bind everyone.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.600
So you know, those companies that have those trade associations, et cetera, this also gives

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:08.040
a framework for us to really say, okay, this is a voice of this sector, this sector, this

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.040
sector.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.360
If we do not have this, it's a bit complicated for us to take it as just being the voice

01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:19.040
of the entire community, because you can have an opinion and someone else can have another

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:23.560
one, but then which one do I have to consider as being the one of this community?

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.040
That's a bit of the complexity also for us, just to be honest.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.120
On the charity one, there are definitions.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.200
Commercial activity is whatever against for money or for free.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:42.120
It does not matter the economic value in that sense.

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:46.280
It's a concept that goes much more broader than this.

01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:51.640
So I understand that there is this need of clarification.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:56.240
This is where the definitions are there.

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.800
But they are also the basics of any legislation that we have in the union.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:10.040
It's not that simple to change just one definition that is common to all of them in one single

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.040
piece of legislation.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.920
This is also the reality of how the proposal works.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.800
You need coherence.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.200
You can have some exclusions.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:27.240
But we talk about why, I mean, it's not just the need of excluding open source software.

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.080
It's also the need of ensuring that it does not have an impact on innovation, but you

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.840
also need to take into account the reality of it.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:37.840
So that's a bit of the...

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:38.840
Thanks, Omar.

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840
Benjamin?

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.840
Yeah, sorry.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.840
I just want to be thorough.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.760
I forgot to answer one of the questions I just realised.

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.280
So there was a question on whether we think we... whether there could be a risk that products

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.300
developed in third countries would simply not be made available anymore on the European

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.300
Union market.

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.080
So no, we don't see this risk, to be honest.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.640
I mean, the European Union, depending on the figures that you look at, is probably the

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.400
biggest economy in the world.

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.360
I think everyone has a very strong interest in bringing their products on our market.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.520
It has also not been the case with other regulation.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.800
If you think of the GDPR, yeah, I mean, the list of companies that choose not to provide

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.320
services in the European Union because of GDPR is very short, yeah.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.400
So we don't see this risk.

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.240
Thanks, Benjamin.

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:30.120
I know, Martin, you're dying to say something.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.160
So Hannah, go to you.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.000
Thank you, James.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.760
So I will answer the question for Alexander of how to fix this.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.100
But first, I would like to respond to some of the comments made.

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:50.760
So I think you hit the nail on the head by saying that the consultation, that it's complex

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.880
within the existing way of how Brussels operate, at least that's my perspective now as a newcomer

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.380
here.

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:02.760
And I think if we are not addressing that bit, like how to talk to communities like

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.980
this, then we will be in this situation again and again and again and again.

01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:13.120
And I want to point out specifically that the discussion about commercial just now,

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.280
I've read both your proposals, and you are not using the same examples of what constitutes

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:20.880
a commercial activity.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:31.540
So if you're saying that they originated from the legal jurisprudence, then one of you seems

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:36.280
to have a different view on the jurisprudence than the other one.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:46.840
And I was wondering, have you considered talking to the open source program office when considering

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.840
the definition?

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.760
And I'm sorry if this is a bit confrontational, but I was just actually curious.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:58.080
So before you answer, I'm going to try to answer Alex Alexander's question.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.000
I think he was asking how to fix this.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.500
I'm not jealous of your jobs because I think this is extremely complicated and I don't

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.800
have the full answers.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.440
I have one sub-answer and it relates to critical products.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:18.360
I believe that there should be an escape hatch for class one and class two critical products

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:25.880
that if they are completely open source, then there should be the ability to do self-assessment

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:32.120
regardless of any other factors.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:37.960
Because I think the value of having critical products that are open source is tremendous

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.800
in terms of security too.

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:46.000
So we should be considering that aspect in addition to whether or not there is an EU

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.080
standard that it can conform to, for example.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:57.720
I hope I touched somewhat on the ask again in maybe a couple of weeks because I think

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.760
they are in a hurry, so we should be too.

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:08.200
And then maybe back to the question I just asked about talking to Gheis.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.880
The power of the moderator.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.880
What's it worth?

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880
Cold beer?

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:18.040
Maybe just to add one question to make your debate a little harder.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.560
First I think that we also need to recognize that you guys are also here on a Saturday

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:29.040
and everything, so I think the appetite to interact with many groups is also there.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.720
So I think that's important to acknowledge as well.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:37.040
But I'm mostly wondering about the part on technical support because we are focusing

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.240
a lot on the definition of commercial, but the text itself says also especially when

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:52.040
technical support is provided, then the open source software is not excluded anymore.

01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.520
And I guess this is more of a general question because I'm not myself an open source developer,

01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:02.440
but I'm just wondering to what extent this is demotivating then for developers because

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:07.400
I understand a big part of the maintenance after, for example, is a motivating factor

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.800
for people to develop because then they are also involved later on on the maintenance.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.680
And I'm wondering also to what extent this is counterproductive for the objectives that

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:22.200
the CRA sets, having the people that are involved in the development but also they're involved

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.520
in the later stages of making sure that the product remains secure, then actually this

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.840
I think I would assume that it helps the security of the product.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.600
So it's more of a question on whether you have discussed this part.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.240
I'm sure you have if you put it there, but just if you could elaborate a bit further

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:44.320
and an open question also to the audience just because I think it's important for the

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:48.280
audience to sort of educate us as well.

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.280
Thank you.

01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:50.280
Yes.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.280
Okay.

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:53.720
We've got five minutes left.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.480
So Roman, Omar, and then we close.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.560
So I'm just going to continue what you just said.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:06.000
I think one of the tremendous beauty of the open source community is giving support to

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.920
each other.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.080
And I think technical support, as defined, is very dangerous.

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.820
And I'm going to give an example.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:21.360
If you are having a if you maintain a project and you use one of these service like GitHub

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:26.500
and you start helping someone to make the solution work.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.800
So it's technical support, right?

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.080
So you open an issue, you start helping the person and so on.

01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:41.320
If the person who received the help decide to sponsor somehow the developers giving money,

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.400
giving contributions in terms of money, then from the definition it becomes a commercial

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.860
activity.

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.480
This is not the intent.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.860
It's a donation.

01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:54.360
So I think it's really important to get that into perspective.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:44:03.080
So we are not reducing the level of contribution both in terms of software development, documentation,

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:08.640
but also money to run some testing infrastructure that is required to do security.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.640
So that's my point.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640
Just it.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640
Wonderful.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.640
There's an applause.

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.640
There we are.

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.640
Good.

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.200
So Omar, I'm going to hand it to you.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:24.240
I know you wanted to answer a point from Martin.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:32.520
So for the internal cuisine of how the Commission works, proposal don't come out from one own

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.360
service.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.080
So we have three different director generals.

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.440
So connect for the telecommunication.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.400
Digi-Grow is for the industry and the JIT.

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:52.480
Each proposal before going out is assessed by all the dedicated services of the Commission.

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:57.880
So everyone is consulted and everyone makes the legislation readapted where it needed

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:03.720
because obviously the expertise of each one of the director generals helps to make the

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.920
proposal.

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:10.920
So you need – it's an internal mandatory step.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:15.440
And on the small definition, it's not that we have different concepts.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:22.560
It's the – how it has been interpreted until now and we're talking about almost 40 years

01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.560
of case law.

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.520
It's elements of what the commercial activity can be and cannot be.

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.040
It's never a proper situation.

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:32.560
It does never draw a specific line.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.400
I know it does not reply to your question, but we have elements of what is or what is

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.820
not a commercial activity and all of them take into account at the end to create the

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.980
commercial activity.

01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:49.160
But they are not – it's not just if you are in room A, it's commercial activity and

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.160
in room B, it's a commercial activity.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.760
It's different element that can constitute the commercial activity or not.

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.280
That's a bit of a situation.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.680
If you are developing your open source software from your couch on a Sunday, this is not covered.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:09.920
If you're – if a big company takes it out from a website, whatever, you are not making

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:13.960
the commercial activity, but the company is doing the commercial activity.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:18.040
So you're not – you know, these are a bit of the differences.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.040
These are the elements.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:25.080
But if you make it – if you make yourself money out of it, this is a commercial activity

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.800
in a way or another.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.740
If you also make it, you are the commercial activity.

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:36.400
If a big company takes the software and puts it in its product, he's doing the commercial

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.360
activity but not you.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.320
So you will be the one to cover it, not yourself.

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.720
It's a bit of – this is how the commercial activity works.

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.200
I know it's complex, but yeah.

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:52.160
I don't know.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.760
We have two minutes left, so 60 seconds.

01:46:54.760 --> 01:47:01.600
Yeah, I mean, on this technical support, I mean, it's of course a tricky one, right?

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.440
The idea behind the Commission Proposal of the Site Resilience Act is to say that when

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.280
you're making money with a product, it's a commercial activity and then you should

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.600
comply with the rules because there are so many different ways in which you can monetize

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:15.600
a project.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.600
It's not always just charging a price, yeah.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:23.400
It could also be placing ads in your mobile app or, I mean, charging a lot of money for

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400
technical support.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.660
I mean, technical support does not necessarily mean that it's a non-commercial activity.

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:32.800
So of course it's different if you just recover your costs, yeah.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.440
That's maybe something else.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.160
But if you're truly making money with a project, we are convinced that it's only fair

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:45.120
that you are covered by the subresilience act.

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:51.080
So that end device compatibility check, compliance check, I think is important.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:53.360
I think we've run out of time.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:48:00.720
We could have gone into the whole notion of components, which you mentioned on 11.7, and

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.400
where we see that posing some workability issues.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.240
Unfortunately, we've run out of time.

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.080
But I would like to ask you all to show your...
