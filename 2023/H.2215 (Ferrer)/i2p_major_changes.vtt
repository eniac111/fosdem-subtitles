Hi everyone, this is I2P major changes of the Peer2Peer network by Konrad BÃ¤chler.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.920
Almost close enough.

00:15.920 --> 00:16.920
Enjoy.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.920
Hello everyone.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.360
Thank you for being here.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.240
That's my third I2P talk at Fosstem.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
First one was about DNS.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.680
That was the most difficult for me personally.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.040
That was JavaScript which was also difficult for me and now a major changes of the Peer2Peer

00:31.040 --> 00:40.840
network of a bunch of programmers which are creating I2P which is an overlay network.

00:40.840 --> 00:47.080
I'm an independent researcher and software architect and developer and I'm developing

00:47.080 --> 00:55.120
libraries and I'm working full time for D.W.Xchange which is a small non-profit association in

00:55.120 --> 00:57.440
the world.

00:57.440 --> 01:01.280
There is nothing like a centralized model involved because I'm totally living in the

01:01.280 --> 01:06.800
Peer2Peer I2P world because I really love what the I2P developers and the open-source

01:06.800 --> 01:10.480
space are doing since the last 20 years.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.240
I suggest we're looking now at the agenda.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.920
I give you a short introduction of I2P and then we're looking at what the developers

01:18.920 --> 01:28.480
did as the latest changes of the code and we'll focus since I'm an application developer

01:28.480 --> 01:31.840
based on the I2P network, what is the impact?

01:31.840 --> 01:37.720
We're looking at the summary and I understood that there are no questions so if you have

01:37.720 --> 01:42.840
questions I'll be outside in the hall for a few minutes and I'm happy to get in touch

01:42.840 --> 01:49.480
with you if you have critical and skeptical questions.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.600
Sure thing, what is the role of D.W.Xchange within I2P?

01:52.600 --> 01:59.220
I2P is a developer team, D.W.Xchange is a developer team and the I2P developers are

01:59.220 --> 02:00.720
spread all over the world.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.560
The D.W. developers are spread all over the world.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.840
We're cooperating friendly but we're not the same.

02:06.840 --> 02:15.920
D.W.Xchange is primarily a library developer and is supporting so-called official open

02:15.920 --> 02:18.200
source to Docker images.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200
That's what we're doing.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.640
Myself, since I'm a researcher I'm cooperating with Swiss universities and I'm open for all

02:24.640 --> 02:31.760
corporations with any university to take a very skeptical perspective towards our own

02:31.760 --> 02:33.960
work.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.440
Now what is the I2P network?

02:35.440 --> 02:38.280
I2P network is an overlay network.

02:38.280 --> 02:44.720
An overlay network and now please jump to the very last line of this slide.

02:44.720 --> 02:51.300
I2P gives you privacy by design, serious privacy by design.

02:51.300 --> 02:55.720
It means you get confidentiality and total anonymity.

02:55.720 --> 03:03.700
Just an example, this statement that the network gives you total anonymity is something which

03:03.700 --> 03:08.880
we do research in Switzerland whether we can break this anonymity and that's one of our

03:08.880 --> 03:10.200
research approaches.

03:10.200 --> 03:20.440
But currently, at the current stage of knowledge and since I2P is existing since 20 years,

03:20.440 --> 03:23.400
we can say it's confidential and anonymous.

03:23.400 --> 03:29.240
Now a question, whoever in this room in the past presentations there was around 5% of

03:29.240 --> 03:33.680
the audience have ever got in touch and used I2P in their life.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.680
Please hands up.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.400
Wow, that's close to 20%.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.800
Cool, thank you.

03:40.800 --> 03:47.960
For the others which do not know it, anonymity has a cost attached and this cost is called

03:47.960 --> 03:49.520
latency.

03:49.520 --> 03:54.600
When I'm talking about an anonymous network which gives you full confidentiality, then

03:54.600 --> 04:02.920
these messages are multiple time encrypted and hop from peer to peer to its destination

04:02.920 --> 04:08.120
and through another tunnel they hop back, the reply hops back.

04:08.120 --> 04:13.960
And this is giving anonymity on a very, very, very high level.

04:13.960 --> 04:21.740
A word to be clear here, I2P has no storage capability by itself.

04:21.740 --> 04:26.080
It's a transport layer.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.740
Now how to get I2P?

04:28.740 --> 04:31.600
Those which got in touch with it, they know that.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.700
There are the Linux Red Pose and then there are PPAs and then there are the container

04:35.700 --> 04:40.000
maintained by DevoExchange which you find on Docker.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.680
Now why is there I2P and why is there I2PD?

04:43.680 --> 04:49.140
Because there are two versions available from two development teams.

04:49.140 --> 04:55.880
In short, I2P is written in Java, it has a user interface and there are a lot of fans

04:55.880 --> 05:01.480
around there which really like that and then there is a smaller version which is I2PD which

05:01.480 --> 05:06.920
is written in C++ and which is a daemon only so it's rather a bit more for odd means.

05:06.920 --> 05:13.360
Devo uses I2PD and there's also the image maintainer on Docker for this version.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.600
From my point of view, both are equally valid.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.640
Bit of warning, please don't trust any binaries which are floating around here and there which

05:22.640 --> 05:25.360
you can't reproduce locally by yourself.

05:25.360 --> 05:32.680
Please build it yourself if you can and sure you can because this gives power to the open

05:32.680 --> 05:34.480
source developers.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.240
If you just consume some binaries, please don't.

05:38.240 --> 05:44.080
It's also dangerous because you have a router running on your local machine.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.440
The whole thing here is it's a peer-to-peer network without any central authority, without

05:49.440 --> 05:52.880
any trust involved.

05:52.880 --> 05:58.400
Now the latest changes.

05:58.400 --> 06:12.040
Since 20 years, I2P is existing and gets developed and there are two transport protocols, TCP

06:12.040 --> 06:14.280
and UDP.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.760
TCP is also used within other overlay networks.

06:18.760 --> 06:26.480
Was along a while so around four years already upgraded to so-called NTCP2 which is much

06:26.480 --> 06:32.920
modernized so the TCP communication was already pretty well done in the last four years.

06:32.920 --> 06:39.400
But UDP which is something where you just blow out messages to the network and I'll

06:39.400 --> 06:48.200
talk about that in a minute which is fast for I2P in an I2P context was not modernized

06:48.200 --> 06:50.800
since 15 years.

06:50.800 --> 06:59.720
The developer of I2P, they worked one full year on modernizing UDP and they call it SSU2.

06:59.720 --> 07:06.840
When you hear SSU2 in the context of I2P, it's UDP.

07:06.840 --> 07:13.240
If you want to dig deeper, deeper, then please take a look at noiseprotocol.org.

07:13.240 --> 07:20.800
That's very important also for other overlay networks you might heard of.

07:20.800 --> 07:29.040
The developer team of I2P has borrowed quite some things from WireGuard, VPN and also from

07:29.040 --> 07:36.840
Quick and there are some RFCs around so please dig deeper by using these hints.

07:36.840 --> 07:42.160
Then the cryptography had to be updated too.

07:42.160 --> 07:47.560
There will be more work coming in the upcoming years I know for sure.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.320
But it's now already on a quite good state.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.600
Right, seven minutes to go.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.960
What were the goals?

07:54.960 --> 08:05.720
UDP, the performance, is simply much better in an overlay network than TCP.

08:05.720 --> 08:13.800
Me as an application developer which is creating a fully distributed storage layer on top of

08:13.800 --> 08:21.520
the I2P network, performance to communicate between the notes in the peer-to-peer network

08:21.520 --> 08:23.480
is an issue.

08:23.480 --> 08:32.080
For me it was always the choice to take UDP and I implemented a gossiping protocol to

08:32.080 --> 08:36.760
realize this fully anonymous blockchain.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.000
This distributed storage layer.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.360
I needed UDP so that the peers could communicate within each other.

08:44.360 --> 08:50.960
For me this was really an important goal that they could improve the performance a lot.

08:50.960 --> 08:56.720
Additionally, as you know, there are countries in this world where communication is not that

08:56.720 --> 09:00.640
easy as we have the luck to be here in Europe.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.760
So obfuscation is a topic.

09:03.760 --> 09:09.040
For all those people, for all the whistleblowers and the journalists which are using I2P in

09:09.040 --> 09:13.040
critical countries, they must not be detected.

09:13.040 --> 09:20.120
And I2P is one of the premier solutions for such people which need communication on a

09:20.120 --> 09:23.840
very confidential level.

09:23.840 --> 09:34.880
The obfuscation was a big topic and additionally UDP is easily attackable so the developers

09:34.880 --> 09:37.760
had to look into the security problems they had.

09:37.760 --> 09:46.520
And they did a good job.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.960
There are a few other challenges of UDP like the fragmentation of messages.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.920
You have a long message, you want to send it through the network but it gets chopped

09:54.920 --> 10:01.760
up into pieces and UDP is not reliable so the developers really had some challenges

10:01.760 --> 10:04.600
to solve in the last 12 months.

10:04.600 --> 10:12.000
But the fact is they have implemented strong solutions and today if you look at the release

10:12.000 --> 10:20.480
notes of I2P, I2P is in a much better state.

10:20.480 --> 10:28.320
And this is what I want you as a core take out of this presentation.

10:28.320 --> 10:37.120
I2P gives users 20 years real privacy by design and the developers did a good job the last

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
20 years.

10:38.120 --> 10:46.280
But now with this performance improvement and that's my personal view on their work,

10:46.280 --> 10:49.280
they really made a major step forward.

10:49.280 --> 10:55.760
Because UDP is for application developers really important within the I2P network.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.840
That's my personal view on it.

10:57.840 --> 11:03.240
Please feel free to criticize me afterwards in the Q&A session outside if you see this

11:03.240 --> 11:08.160
differently or if you have a different view on it, I'm happy to hear that.

11:08.160 --> 11:16.360
But these reductions, they are relevant.

11:16.360 --> 11:23.280
For us as application developers we directly felt this performance impact.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.800
In November when the release was, so four months ago or three and a half months ago,

11:28.800 --> 11:35.120
the performance in our blockchain test network improved very much.

11:35.120 --> 11:41.640
And although I believe from research point of view we have quite some work ahead of us

11:41.640 --> 11:49.720
to skeptically and very critically looking at the latest changes to see whether some

11:49.720 --> 11:56.880
weird box have been introduced, the first impression of the two months is woohoo, that's

11:56.880 --> 11:58.640
a new generation of I2P.

11:58.640 --> 12:03.800
So for me the performance impact is really, really relevant.

12:03.800 --> 12:11.160
Okay, we're on the target, we're seeing the target line.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.360
Takeouts.

12:13.360 --> 12:23.080
After 20 years of development I2P is the leading peer to peer privacy by design network which

12:23.080 --> 12:29.040
is a transport layer only which gives you today very modern cryptography, very modern

12:29.040 --> 12:36.160
possibilities to use as an application developer.

12:36.160 --> 12:51.560
The performance increased significantly since last November and if you feel as a researcher

12:51.560 --> 12:57.800
too or as an application developer to take a closer look at I2P I believe now it's a

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
good time.

12:58.800 --> 13:05.080
Either you can invest as a researcher trying to break the anonymity and present it at

13:05.080 --> 13:11.200
an upcoming conference or you try to create some applications on top of it.

13:11.200 --> 13:18.000
I believe currently it's a good point to take a look again at I2P because now it's really

13:18.000 --> 13:22.080
quite fast to use and it's also fun to use.

13:22.080 --> 13:27.120
On GitHub, so that's in the lower right corner and you'll find it online on GitHub, you'll

13:27.120 --> 13:34.760
find Docker images which help you to get started with I2P really quickly.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.280
Because a peer to peer network to create it as a test network is quite complex but we

13:39.280 --> 13:44.680
created here simple images for you which you can start with Docker Compose, you have all

13:44.680 --> 13:50.280
the containers running and tada, you're a member of the I2P network and you can write

13:50.280 --> 13:57.280
your application on top of this network.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.240
Here is a list of sources.

14:00.240 --> 14:11.200
Please do your own research too because privacy by design also means that we hope to motivate

14:11.200 --> 14:17.760
US developers to take a look, a very close look at the documentation, a very close look

14:17.760 --> 14:25.720
at the source code to be sceptical because privacy is such an important topic for us

14:25.720 --> 14:26.720
as developers.

14:26.720 --> 14:33.720
So we're always very, very pleased if we get critical feedbacks on the development of the

14:33.720 --> 14:37.040
stuff we're doing.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.960
Thank you very much for your time.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.800
Have a great Fostem.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Thank you.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.800
Thanks, Corin.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Really nice talk.

14:44.800 --> 14:56.040
Again, if you have questions, please grab them outside and I'd be happy to answer.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.720
I hope.

14:58.720 --> 15:14.600
Thank you.
