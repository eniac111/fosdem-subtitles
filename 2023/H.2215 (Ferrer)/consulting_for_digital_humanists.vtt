WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.060
So, my name is Marie de Brumais, consulting for digital humanists, the cultural shock

00:12.060 --> 00:15.320
be developing tools and pedagogy.

00:15.320 --> 00:20.980
This talk is given on behalf of the Center for Digital Humanities in Uppsala, which is

00:20.980 --> 00:23.220
where I work.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.220
Here you have my contact.

00:24.220 --> 00:31.160
You can contact me via email, mastodon, as well as my website.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.080
I'm an engineer in digital humanities.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.560
We'll come back on that later.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.160
What you need to know is that I'm located in two countries in the city of Leland, France,

00:43.160 --> 00:48.600
and in Uppsala, where my work and university is.

00:48.600 --> 00:56.760
From my spare time, I'm a activist in Uppsala women's coding, as well as sometimes in Ulug

00:56.760 --> 01:00.760
and Raoul in Uppsala.

01:00.760 --> 01:07.680
So, I'm not the first digital humanist you are encountering in the first day.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.440
I did a little bit of a survey.

01:11.440 --> 01:18.560
And so, at least four people I could identify as digital humanists in the past, as the name

01:18.560 --> 01:23.440
of Jan Jonsson, Van Eeley, Guido, Ollie, Obert, Antoine, Fauchet.

01:23.440 --> 01:30.360
Thank you to them for opening the path and just being pure near and indirectly making

01:30.360 --> 01:34.520
me feel welcome in coming to your community.

01:34.520 --> 01:44.720
So, without further introduction, what is digital humanities?

01:44.720 --> 01:49.280
It's a pretty new field and it's a blurry term.

01:49.280 --> 01:54.240
I'm not going to have the talk of three days and three nights without sleeping about how

01:54.240 --> 01:55.640
to define it.

01:55.640 --> 02:03.400
What you need to know is that it's the field in the intersections between computer science

02:03.400 --> 02:08.380
and humanities, all sorts of humanities.

02:08.380 --> 02:15.000
And what in this context an engineer in digital humanities is, it's someone technical that

02:15.000 --> 02:21.120
will have expertise in one or several domains of computer science and whose mission is to

02:21.120 --> 02:24.880
help humanists in their project.

02:24.880 --> 02:33.040
By humanists we can mean a philosopher, literature analyst, historian, sociology, archaeology,

02:33.040 --> 02:36.920
etc. etc.

02:36.920 --> 02:44.280
I thought to give you a bit of context, examples would talk more than a long discourse.

02:44.280 --> 02:51.800
So if you're an engineer in digital humanities, you could be helping a theologist mapping

02:51.800 --> 03:00.080
all the colors of the Bible to show the color ambiance of the New Testament.

03:00.080 --> 03:09.800
You could be also building an online database to help an art historian broadcasting their

03:09.800 --> 03:21.000
un-psychopedical knowledge about some engravings of books, etc.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.280
You do not need to read this complicated table, but I will attract your attention to a couple

03:27.280 --> 03:29.080
of things.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.480
First, observe the subjects.

03:33.480 --> 03:39.480
The subjects are pretty academics, academical subjects, things that computer scientists

03:39.480 --> 03:49.640
will normally not be very familiar to, like literature, Scandinavian languages, linguistics,

03:49.640 --> 03:53.680
here the ALM means the archives, etc. etc.

03:53.680 --> 03:59.520
We have an audience of very academic people, people that have no contact with the corporate

03:59.520 --> 04:07.040
world, that have been in academia and stayed in academia after.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.800
Look at this, we have a pretty gender balanced group and slightly actually female dominated.

04:12.800 --> 04:17.640
I counted 16 women here in this room, including me.

04:17.640 --> 04:23.440
So that's an interesting contrast.

04:23.440 --> 04:30.560
Actually the title probably doesn't speak to you too much because it's a pretty specialized

04:30.560 --> 04:32.920
topic.

04:32.920 --> 04:38.560
Could we even say niche topics?

04:38.560 --> 04:47.640
I had fun making a table of the differences between the engineering world and the humanistic

04:47.640 --> 04:48.920
world.

04:48.920 --> 04:53.100
By the way, I have a background in classics before going to natural language processing,

04:53.100 --> 04:56.440
so I'm accustomed to this switch of culture.

04:56.440 --> 05:04.640
Additionally, to the remarks I have made, I will add that among engineers and computer

05:04.640 --> 05:12.320
scientists, the programming is the norm and often as an operating system you will see

05:12.320 --> 05:15.320
Linux or Mac, or at least when I was in the department of natural language processing

05:15.320 --> 05:21.080
that was what I was seeing, you would use in an academic context later, you would exchange

05:21.080 --> 05:23.720
terminal apps, etc. etc.

05:23.720 --> 05:30.320
Whereas if you land in the department of humanities, you will have a point and click as a norm

05:30.320 --> 05:34.480
and offer proprietary tools as a norm.

05:34.480 --> 05:39.080
Windows Mac pour a point where I have been asked in conferences to give pour a point

05:39.080 --> 05:51.040
PPTX files and Word documents and no one gets offended by that.

05:51.040 --> 05:58.480
So yeah, industry influence, I can make a good job.

05:58.480 --> 06:06.840
And I think finally the most important is that in computer science we are very metrics

06:06.840 --> 06:13.800
oriented, optimizing maybe speed or quantified performances, whereas the humanists are very

06:13.800 --> 06:18.760
question oriented.

06:18.760 --> 06:27.040
So between those two different audience that we need to gather in digital humanities, how

06:27.040 --> 06:32.000
do we help each other?

06:32.000 --> 06:40.880
And to be able to continue my talk or end my talk in something positive, I will start

06:40.880 --> 06:53.360
in the, let's say, more obstacles or negative points of trying this marriage between the

06:53.360 --> 06:54.680
two fields.

06:54.680 --> 07:01.680
I think if you want to have free software, computer science and free software in the

07:01.680 --> 07:10.680
digital humanities, you need to overcome a lack of visibility from the free software

07:10.680 --> 07:13.200
world towards the humanist.

07:13.200 --> 07:22.760
And I think this Versa, and I thought of taking short example of technical tools we are working

07:22.760 --> 07:23.760
with.

07:23.760 --> 07:28.480
So in digital humanities, I'm specialized in web scraping and NLP.

07:28.480 --> 07:36.320
And as engineers, we tend to use, I would say, open source tools like Python, Dutiful

07:36.320 --> 07:46.200
Soup and Spacey, whereas people that will be less computer savvy in digital humanities

07:46.200 --> 07:55.320
will use more proprietary softwares such as WebScraper.io or NSCONC, which has the advantage

07:55.320 --> 08:00.240
to be point and click tools, to be simpler, more straightforward, to have less functionalities

08:00.240 --> 08:03.040
as well.

08:03.040 --> 08:10.720
And yes, another remark is that I noticed recently while giving courses to digital humanists

08:10.720 --> 08:15.160
that people are asking me if I can teach them GitHub.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.120
And I say, no, I can teach you Git, not GitHub.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.360
So it's very revealing the fact that they don't even know the difference or what it

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
means.

08:24.360 --> 08:30.240
It's very revealing that they know GitHub before understanding the notion of Git.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.640
So I think this is, to stress my point, about lack of visibility of the open source world,

08:35.640 --> 08:40.920
or maybe the over visibility of the freeware world.

08:40.920 --> 08:48.360
The second obstacle to bringing free software to digital humanists is maybe a lack of cohesion.

08:48.360 --> 08:58.960
I mean, digital humanities is an essence topic where we have a lot of groups already spread

08:58.960 --> 09:03.160
with different languages, digital historians, digital literature analysts, et cetera, et

09:03.160 --> 09:04.160
cetera.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.320
And so they have already had time gathering together.

09:07.320 --> 09:14.360
So in this context, it's hard to make as well a community of open source enthusiasts.

09:14.360 --> 09:21.880
So it's not yet built this community in this context.

09:21.880 --> 09:29.480
The next point or obstacle is, I would say, the lack of common references, or I would

09:29.480 --> 09:33.720
say that not of common values.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.280
So it's hard to find a language to understand each other's.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.560
We'll come back on that in the positive points.

09:41.560 --> 09:48.120
And yeah, that's it for the obstacles I can see.

09:48.120 --> 09:58.640
Then on the positive points, or on what could make this Maria Josephus, we have first, I

09:58.640 --> 10:06.560
think humanists will be a very receptive audience to the philosophy of free software.

10:06.560 --> 10:12.880
I mean, enlightenment philosophy existed before and was at least a student in humanities and

10:12.880 --> 10:18.400
was a student in humanities before, which has started and was born.

10:18.400 --> 10:26.800
And so they have those references and those references to philosophy and value of spreading

10:26.800 --> 10:32.080
the knowledge of sharing.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.520
They have a lot of activism in them.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.800
I mean, half of my department is vegan, so it reveals something about them.

10:40.800 --> 10:45.320
They are an nascent but varied community.

10:45.320 --> 10:50.360
I think that's a positive point.

10:50.360 --> 11:02.000
It's a crowd that is diverse, very unusual for a dev crowd.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.600
Even non-neglectable, they have financial means.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.200
The humanities in general do not have much financial needs, not as much as science.

11:14.200 --> 11:20.040
But digital humanists are attracting grants and subsidies for projects.

11:20.040 --> 11:27.920
And that's an indirect way to finance open source and free software.

11:27.920 --> 11:33.680
I'm an engineer developing tools for digital humanists, and my salary is paid by the government

11:33.680 --> 11:38.760
because digital humanities is such a buzzword.

11:38.760 --> 11:46.120
It's finally one very interesting thing about this crowd is that they know about domains

11:46.120 --> 11:52.280
that maybe engineers and computer scientists have interest on but do not have a formal

11:52.280 --> 11:54.560
training on.

11:54.560 --> 12:01.200
Part of them have access easily to training on communication, science of education, ethics,

12:01.200 --> 12:07.080
and are trained to think critically all the time.

12:07.080 --> 12:14.120
I will end my presentation not in certitudes but in doubts and questions.

12:14.120 --> 12:20.280
The questions we could have are ideas to reach better this community and how to make them

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
feel welcome.

12:21.280 --> 12:26.120
That was it for my talk.

12:26.120 --> 12:31.560
After I just kept for illustration purpose in case I have questions that I happen to

12:31.560 --> 12:39.760
have prepared, and references here all in the slides.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
Thank you.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.760
We can have questions.

12:43.760 --> 13:04.720
Yes, I will open the floor to questions.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.840
Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been going on for about the

13:07.840 --> 13:10.920
last 10 years?

13:10.920 --> 13:14.120
Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been going on for about 10

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
years now?

13:15.120 --> 13:18.600
There's quite an active group in the Nordic countries and in the UK that have a lot of

13:18.600 --> 13:20.320
common issues with what you've just been talking about.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.080
There will be a very good community for you to get involved with.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.760
Aware like this, no research.

13:25.760 --> 13:30.600
Is it any link to the dev room of yesterday about the research tools?

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
I don't know.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
I wasn't in that dev room.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
No.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Okay.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
But thank you for your remark.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.400
Please come to me after and I will write that down.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.680
We have one minute left.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
Yes.

13:45.680 --> 13:57.080
On the other side.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.160
Thank you.

13:59.160 --> 14:05.400
How could you, would you suggest to approach someone in the humanities sector that maybe

14:05.400 --> 14:11.240
needs a hand with the project but doesn't really know what can IT do for it?

14:11.240 --> 14:15.160
Does it really know what we do?

14:15.160 --> 14:19.200
I had a set of questions when I do consulting.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.720
I can read them to you.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.880
First, context.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.960
What is your domain?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.600
What does your domain focus on?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.440
Because they can be very varied.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.320
What is the problem you try to solve?

14:28.320 --> 14:32.120
Eventually, what did you already try to solve your problem?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
What tools did you use?

14:33.120 --> 14:38.440
That will give you an idea because they will be very blurry about what they want.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.280
That will help anchoring.

14:40.280 --> 14:45.000
What are the data you have and hope to collect and they rarely think about it.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.280
And finally, and the most important, can you present me your data?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
Screenshots.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.480
Probably they have an Excel file or something, whatever.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.520
Size, format.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.360
How has it been collected?

14:57.360 --> 15:03.680
And things you think are as a computer scientist quantification, they don't think like that.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.120
They just think questions.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.120
So I think that could help.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.120
Thank you.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
You're welcome.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.120
Thanks everyone.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.120
We'll give you all another close.

15:11.120 --> 15:27.880
A big round of applause.
