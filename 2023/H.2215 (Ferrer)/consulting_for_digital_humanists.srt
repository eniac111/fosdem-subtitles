1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:12.060
So, my name is Marie de Brumais, consulting for digital humanists, the cultural shock

2
0:00:12.060 --> 0:00:15.320
be developing tools and pedagogy.

3
0:00:15.320 --> 0:00:20.980
This talk is given on behalf of the Center for Digital Humanities in Uppsala, which is

4
0:00:20.980 --> 0:00:23.220
where I work.

5
0:00:23.220 --> 0:00:24.220
Here you have my contact.

6
0:00:24.220 --> 0:00:31.160
You can contact me via email, mastodon, as well as my website.

7
0:00:31.160 --> 0:00:34.080
I'm an engineer in digital humanities.

8
0:00:34.080 --> 0:00:37.560
We'll come back on that later.

9
0:00:37.560 --> 0:00:43.160
What you need to know is that I'm located in two countries in the city of Leland, France,

10
0:00:43.160 --> 0:00:48.600
and in Uppsala, where my work and university is.

11
0:00:48.600 --> 0:00:56.760
From my spare time, I'm a activist in Uppsala women's coding, as well as sometimes in Ulug

12
0:00:56.760 --> 0:01:00.760
and Raoul in Uppsala.

13
0:01:00.760 --> 0:01:07.680
So, I'm not the first digital humanist you are encountering in the first day.

14
0:01:07.680 --> 0:01:11.440
I did a little bit of a survey.

15
0:01:11.440 --> 0:01:18.560
And so, at least four people I could identify as digital humanists in the past, as the name

16
0:01:18.560 --> 0:01:23.440
of Jan Jonsson, Van Eeley, Guido, Ollie, Obert, Antoine, Fauchet.

17
0:01:23.440 --> 0:01:30.360
Thank you to them for opening the path and just being pure near and indirectly making

18
0:01:30.360 --> 0:01:34.520
me feel welcome in coming to your community.

19
0:01:34.520 --> 0:01:44.720
So, without further introduction, what is digital humanities?

20
0:01:44.720 --> 0:01:49.280
It's a pretty new field and it's a blurry term.

21
0:01:49.280 --> 0:01:54.240
I'm not going to have the talk of three days and three nights without sleeping about how

22
0:01:54.240 --> 0:01:55.640
to define it.

23
0:01:55.640 --> 0:02:03.400
What you need to know is that it's the field in the intersections between computer science

24
0:02:03.400 --> 0:02:08.380
and humanities, all sorts of humanities.

25
0:02:08.380 --> 0:02:15.000
And what in this context an engineer in digital humanities is, it's someone technical that

26
0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:21.120
will have expertise in one or several domains of computer science and whose mission is to

27
0:02:21.120 --> 0:02:24.880
help humanists in their project.

28
0:02:24.880 --> 0:02:33.040
By humanists we can mean a philosopher, literature analyst, historian, sociology, archaeology,

29
0:02:33.040 --> 0:02:36.920
etc. etc.

30
0:02:36.920 --> 0:02:44.280
I thought to give you a bit of context, examples would talk more than a long discourse.

31
0:02:44.280 --> 0:02:51.800
So if you're an engineer in digital humanities, you could be helping a theologist mapping

32
0:02:51.800 --> 0:03:00.080
all the colors of the Bible to show the color ambiance of the New Testament.

33
0:03:00.080 --> 0:03:09.800
You could be also building an online database to help an art historian broadcasting their

34
0:03:09.800 --> 0:03:21.000
un-psychopedical knowledge about some engravings of books, etc.

35
0:03:21.000 --> 0:03:27.280
You do not need to read this complicated table, but I will attract your attention to a couple

36
0:03:27.280 --> 0:03:29.080
of things.

37
0:03:29.080 --> 0:03:33.480
First, observe the subjects.

38
0:03:33.480 --> 0:03:39.480
The subjects are pretty academics, academical subjects, things that computer scientists

39
0:03:39.480 --> 0:03:49.640
will normally not be very familiar to, like literature, Scandinavian languages, linguistics,

40
0:03:49.640 --> 0:03:53.680
here the ALM means the archives, etc. etc.

41
0:03:53.680 --> 0:03:59.520
We have an audience of very academic people, people that have no contact with the corporate

42
0:03:59.520 --> 0:04:07.040
world, that have been in academia and stayed in academia after.

43
0:04:07.040 --> 0:04:12.800
Look at this, we have a pretty gender balanced group and slightly actually female dominated.

44
0:04:12.800 --> 0:04:17.640
I counted 16 women here in this room, including me.

45
0:04:17.640 --> 0:04:23.440
So that's an interesting contrast.

46
0:04:23.440 --> 0:04:30.560
Actually the title probably doesn't speak to you too much because it's a pretty specialized

47
0:04:30.560 --> 0:04:32.920
topic.

48
0:04:32.920 --> 0:04:38.560
Could we even say niche topics?

49
0:04:38.560 --> 0:04:47.640
I had fun making a table of the differences between the engineering world and the humanistic

50
0:04:47.640 --> 0:04:48.920
world.

51
0:04:48.920 --> 0:04:53.100
By the way, I have a background in classics before going to natural language processing,

52
0:04:53.100 --> 0:04:56.440
so I'm accustomed to this switch of culture.

53
0:04:56.440 --> 0:05:04.640
Additionally, to the remarks I have made, I will add that among engineers and computer

54
0:05:04.640 --> 0:05:12.320
scientists, the programming is the norm and often as an operating system you will see

55
0:05:12.320 --> 0:05:15.320
Linux or Mac, or at least when I was in the department of natural language processing

56
0:05:15.320 --> 0:05:21.080
that was what I was seeing, you would use in an academic context later, you would exchange

57
0:05:21.080 --> 0:05:23.720
terminal apps, etc. etc.

58
0:05:23.720 --> 0:05:30.320
Whereas if you land in the department of humanities, you will have a point and click as a norm

59
0:05:30.320 --> 0:05:34.480
and offer proprietary tools as a norm.

60
0:05:34.480 --> 0:05:39.080
Windows Mac pour a point where I have been asked in conferences to give pour a point

61
0:05:39.080 --> 0:05:51.040
PPTX files and Word documents and no one gets offended by that.

62
0:05:51.040 --> 0:05:58.480
So yeah, industry influence, I can make a good job.

63
0:05:58.480 --> 0:06:06.840
And I think finally the most important is that in computer science we are very metrics

64
0:06:06.840 --> 0:06:13.800
oriented, optimizing maybe speed or quantified performances, whereas the humanists are very

65
0:06:13.800 --> 0:06:18.760
question oriented.

66
0:06:18.760 --> 0:06:27.040
So between those two different audience that we need to gather in digital humanities, how

67
0:06:27.040 --> 0:06:32.000
do we help each other?

68
0:06:32.000 --> 0:06:40.880
And to be able to continue my talk or end my talk in something positive, I will start

69
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:53.360
in the, let's say, more obstacles or negative points of trying this marriage between the

70
0:06:53.360 --> 0:06:54.680
two fields.

71
0:06:54.680 --> 0:07:01.680
I think if you want to have free software, computer science and free software in the

72
0:07:01.680 --> 0:07:10.680
digital humanities, you need to overcome a lack of visibility from the free software

73
0:07:10.680 --> 0:07:13.200
world towards the humanist.

74
0:07:13.200 --> 0:07:22.760
And I think this Versa, and I thought of taking short example of technical tools we are working

75
0:07:22.760 --> 0:07:23.760
with.

76
0:07:23.760 --> 0:07:28.480
So in digital humanities, I'm specialized in web scraping and NLP.

77
0:07:28.480 --> 0:07:36.320
And as engineers, we tend to use, I would say, open source tools like Python, Dutiful

78
0:07:36.320 --> 0:07:46.200
Soup and Spacey, whereas people that will be less computer savvy in digital humanities

79
0:07:46.200 --> 0:07:55.320
will use more proprietary softwares such as WebScraper.io or NSCONC, which has the advantage

80
0:07:55.320 --> 0:08:00.240
to be point and click tools, to be simpler, more straightforward, to have less functionalities

81
0:08:00.240 --> 0:08:03.040
as well.

82
0:08:03.040 --> 0:08:10.720
And yes, another remark is that I noticed recently while giving courses to digital humanists

83
0:08:10.720 --> 0:08:15.160
that people are asking me if I can teach them GitHub.

84
0:08:15.160 --> 0:08:19.120
And I say, no, I can teach you Git, not GitHub.

85
0:08:19.120 --> 0:08:23.360
So it's very revealing the fact that they don't even know the difference or what it

86
0:08:23.360 --> 0:08:24.360
means.

87
0:08:24.360 --> 0:08:30.240
It's very revealing that they know GitHub before understanding the notion of Git.

88
0:08:30.240 --> 0:08:35.640
So I think this is, to stress my point, about lack of visibility of the open source world,

89
0:08:35.640 --> 0:08:40.920
or maybe the over visibility of the freeware world.

90
0:08:40.920 --> 0:08:48.360
The second obstacle to bringing free software to digital humanists is maybe a lack of cohesion.

91
0:08:48.360 --> 0:08:58.960
I mean, digital humanities is an essence topic where we have a lot of groups already spread

92
0:08:58.960 --> 0:09:03.160
with different languages, digital historians, digital literature analysts, et cetera, et

93
0:09:03.160 --> 0:09:04.160
cetera.

94
0:09:04.160 --> 0:09:07.320
And so they have already had time gathering together.

95
0:09:07.320 --> 0:09:14.360
So in this context, it's hard to make as well a community of open source enthusiasts.

96
0:09:14.360 --> 0:09:21.880
So it's not yet built this community in this context.

97
0:09:21.880 --> 0:09:29.480
The next point or obstacle is, I would say, the lack of common references, or I would

98
0:09:29.480 --> 0:09:33.720
say that not of common values.

99
0:09:33.720 --> 0:09:38.280
So it's hard to find a language to understand each other's.

100
0:09:38.280 --> 0:09:41.560
We'll come back on that in the positive points.

101
0:09:41.560 --> 0:09:48.120
And yeah, that's it for the obstacles I can see.

102
0:09:48.120 --> 0:09:58.640
Then on the positive points, or on what could make this Maria Josephus, we have first, I

103
0:09:58.640 --> 0:10:06.560
think humanists will be a very receptive audience to the philosophy of free software.

104
0:10:06.560 --> 0:10:12.880
I mean, enlightenment philosophy existed before and was at least a student in humanities and

105
0:10:12.880 --> 0:10:18.400
was a student in humanities before, which has started and was born.

106
0:10:18.400 --> 0:10:26.800
And so they have those references and those references to philosophy and value of spreading

107
0:10:26.800 --> 0:10:32.080
the knowledge of sharing.

108
0:10:32.080 --> 0:10:35.520
They have a lot of activism in them.

109
0:10:35.520 --> 0:10:40.800
I mean, half of my department is vegan, so it reveals something about them.

110
0:10:40.800 --> 0:10:45.320
They are an nascent but varied community.

111
0:10:45.320 --> 0:10:50.360
I think that's a positive point.

112
0:10:50.360 --> 0:11:02.000
It's a crowd that is diverse, very unusual for a dev crowd.

113
0:11:02.000 --> 0:11:09.600
Even non-neglectable, they have financial means.

114
0:11:09.600 --> 0:11:14.200
The humanities in general do not have much financial needs, not as much as science.

115
0:11:14.200 --> 0:11:20.040
But digital humanists are attracting grants and subsidies for projects.

116
0:11:20.040 --> 0:11:27.920
And that's an indirect way to finance open source and free software.

117
0:11:27.920 --> 0:11:33.680
I'm an engineer developing tools for digital humanists, and my salary is paid by the government

118
0:11:33.680 --> 0:11:38.760
because digital humanities is such a buzzword.

119
0:11:38.760 --> 0:11:46.120
It's finally one very interesting thing about this crowd is that they know about domains

120
0:11:46.120 --> 0:11:52.280
that maybe engineers and computer scientists have interest on but do not have a formal

121
0:11:52.280 --> 0:11:54.560
training on.

122
0:11:54.560 --> 0:12:01.200
Part of them have access easily to training on communication, science of education, ethics,

123
0:12:01.200 --> 0:12:07.080
and are trained to think critically all the time.

124
0:12:07.080 --> 0:12:14.120
I will end my presentation not in certitudes but in doubts and questions.

125
0:12:14.120 --> 0:12:20.280
The questions we could have are ideas to reach better this community and how to make them

126
0:12:20.280 --> 0:12:21.280
feel welcome.

127
0:12:21.280 --> 0:12:26.120
That was it for my talk.

128
0:12:26.120 --> 0:12:31.560
After I just kept for illustration purpose in case I have questions that I happen to

129
0:12:31.560 --> 0:12:39.760
have prepared, and references here all in the slides.

130
0:12:39.760 --> 0:12:40.760
Thank you.

131
0:12:40.760 --> 0:12:43.760
We can have questions.

132
0:12:43.760 --> 0:13:04.720
Yes, I will open the floor to questions.

133
0:13:04.720 --> 0:13:07.840
Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been going on for about the

134
0:13:07.840 --> 0:13:10.920
last 10 years?

135
0:13:10.920 --> 0:13:14.120
Are you aware of the research software engineering movement that's been going on for about 10

136
0:13:14.120 --> 0:13:15.120
years now?

137
0:13:15.120 --> 0:13:18.600
There's quite an active group in the Nordic countries and in the UK that have a lot of

138
0:13:18.600 --> 0:13:20.320
common issues with what you've just been talking about.

139
0:13:20.320 --> 0:13:24.080
There will be a very good community for you to get involved with.

140
0:13:24.080 --> 0:13:25.760
Aware like this, no research.

141
0:13:25.760 --> 0:13:30.600
Is it any link to the dev room of yesterday about the research tools?

142
0:13:30.600 --> 0:13:31.600
I don't know.

143
0:13:31.600 --> 0:13:32.600
I wasn't in that dev room.

144
0:13:32.600 --> 0:13:33.600
No.

145
0:13:33.600 --> 0:13:34.600
Okay.

146
0:13:34.600 --> 0:13:35.600
But thank you for your remark.

147
0:13:35.600 --> 0:13:39.400
Please come to me after and I will write that down.

148
0:13:39.400 --> 0:13:43.680
We have one minute left.

149
0:13:43.680 --> 0:13:45.680
Yes.

150
0:13:45.680 --> 0:13:57.080
On the other side.

151
0:13:57.080 --> 0:13:59.160
Thank you.

152
0:13:59.160 --> 0:14:05.400
How could you, would you suggest to approach someone in the humanities sector that maybe

153
0:14:05.400 --> 0:14:11.240
needs a hand with the project but doesn't really know what can IT do for it?

154
0:14:11.240 --> 0:14:15.160
Does it really know what we do?

155
0:14:15.160 --> 0:14:19.200
I had a set of questions when I do consulting.

156
0:14:19.200 --> 0:14:20.720
I can read them to you.

157
0:14:20.720 --> 0:14:21.880
First, context.

158
0:14:21.880 --> 0:14:22.960
What is your domain?

159
0:14:22.960 --> 0:14:24.600
What does your domain focus on?

160
0:14:24.600 --> 0:14:26.440
Because they can be very varied.

161
0:14:26.440 --> 0:14:28.320
What is the problem you try to solve?

162
0:14:28.320 --> 0:14:32.120
Eventually, what did you already try to solve your problem?

163
0:14:32.120 --> 0:14:33.120
What tools did you use?

164
0:14:33.120 --> 0:14:38.440
That will give you an idea because they will be very blurry about what they want.

165
0:14:38.440 --> 0:14:40.280
That will help anchoring.

166
0:14:40.280 --> 0:14:45.000
What are the data you have and hope to collect and they rarely think about it.

167
0:14:45.000 --> 0:14:49.280
And finally, and the most important, can you present me your data?

168
0:14:49.280 --> 0:14:50.280
Screenshots.

169
0:14:50.280 --> 0:14:53.480
Probably they have an Excel file or something, whatever.

170
0:14:53.480 --> 0:14:55.520
Size, format.

171
0:14:55.520 --> 0:14:57.360
How has it been collected?

172
0:14:57.360 --> 0:15:03.680
And things you think are as a computer scientist quantification, they don't think like that.

173
0:15:03.680 --> 0:15:05.120
They just think questions.

174
0:15:05.120 --> 0:15:07.120
So I think that could help.

175
0:15:07.120 --> 0:15:08.120
Thank you.

176
0:15:08.120 --> 0:15:09.120
