WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.200
Okay, so hello everyone.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.200
I am Francois-Schwarz-Senterberg.

00:08.200 --> 00:18.140
I am really glad to be here and I will present to you Tablonoix, which is an online blackboard.

00:18.140 --> 00:28.480
So a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a mysterious virus attacked the population.

00:28.480 --> 00:35.200
So it attacked almost everybody.

00:35.200 --> 00:42.880
And that's why we decided to organize a lockdown, right?

00:42.880 --> 00:53.080
But we still had to teach and actually we did blackboards to teach and we are not able

00:53.080 --> 00:57.300
to use blackboards anymore.

00:57.300 --> 01:03.800
And actually there exists solutions online that enables to draw and share ideas, but

01:03.800 --> 01:08.920
they don't fit completely the needs.

01:08.920 --> 01:15.120
Some of them looks really like, I would say, graphical drawing softwares.

01:15.120 --> 01:21.200
So with many buttons and usually you need to get rid from all these buttons that are

01:21.200 --> 01:23.920
on the screen.

01:23.920 --> 01:33.280
So usually when you have to explain things, you need to make animations and to make students

01:33.280 --> 01:34.800
interact with you.

01:34.800 --> 01:44.580
So for instance, you know maybe sorting algorithms, like insertion, sort.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.880
And you can use Manette for that.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.620
It's very easy on a blackboard.

01:48.620 --> 01:53.800
You have Manette like that and you can teach, okay, you have to insert five in this.

01:53.800 --> 02:00.200
So you will move this and put five here and nine will be here, okay?

02:00.200 --> 02:10.000
And this is very difficult to use that with real blackboards, with existing tools, solutions

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
that are online.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.560
Also many of them, when you go on the website, you have to sign.

02:16.560 --> 02:24.920
And maybe you don't want to sign up and to give data to the services that offer some

02:24.920 --> 02:27.640
white or blackboards online.

02:27.640 --> 02:33.520
And also when you are using them, actually their server, they keep all your data maybe.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.500
They store your information and you don't want that.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.320
So that's why we decided to create Tableau Noir, which is available on this web page.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.960
You can, so it's online, it's also offline.

02:47.960 --> 02:54.680
You can also use Tableau Noir offline with Electron, which is a kind of software to make

02:54.680 --> 02:57.920
websites used like offline.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.920
It's collaborative and that's it.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.200
So now the rest of the presentation is divided in several parts.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.120
The first part I will discuss the philosophy of the tool.

03:08.120 --> 03:14.760
The second part I will explain a bit more the use of this fridge manniette here.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.360
Then we will discuss the collaborative board aspect of Tableau Noir.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.760
Then I will discuss how to make a presentation with Tableau Noir and finally we'll conclude.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.520
So what is the philosophy of Tableau Noir?

03:26.520 --> 03:28.520
The philosophy is kiss.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.800
So maybe you know this philosophy.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.560
This philosophy means keep it simple and stupid.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.200
This is a bit the philosophy behind Tableau Noir.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.600
So if you have a lot of tools like that in your drawing software, actually you don't

03:43.600 --> 03:49.320
need them because if you want to select a part of your board when you teach, you don't

03:49.320 --> 03:54.000
have time to select the correct tool selecting and then blah, blah, blah.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.120
You will use directly.

03:56.120 --> 04:02.160
Suppose you have this little guy and you want to move this guy on the board, but you just

04:02.160 --> 04:12.200
select with the shock you put around and then control X and boom you can move the little

04:12.200 --> 04:14.000
guy or little girl.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.760
So we don't need this button.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.040
Now you have a button for shock and erase.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.320
You just have one button for toggling.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.720
It's sufficient.

04:22.720 --> 04:32.060
Then you have usually in drawing software you can draw more thick or thin lines.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.240
But with a shock you don't need.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.720
You do that.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.880
So let's get rid of these buttons too.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.600
Button for the type of line is the same.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.040
It's very easy to do that when you teach.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.920
So we don't need that.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.400
Zoom we don't need also.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.720
I will explain that later why we don't need that.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.280
So the tool Tableau Noir is teaching oriented.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.760
You can hide the toolbar.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.040
There is a toolbar but usually you hide it.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.960
We don't care about the toolbar.

05:06.960 --> 05:17.200
You have short keys like C. If you press C you can change the color of your shock and

05:17.200 --> 05:19.400
so on.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.280
Dynamic size of the eraser.

05:21.280 --> 05:28.560
Usually when you erase in drawing software you have to choose the size of your eraser.

05:28.560 --> 05:32.800
When you teach you don't have time, maybe this size is good.

05:32.800 --> 05:40.360
When you erase, if you do it slowly you erase not so much.

05:40.360 --> 05:46.000
And if you start to then it will be big.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.960
Cool.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.480
Accessibility.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.920
Some persons are left handed and others are right handed.

05:56.920 --> 06:02.560
So on the project I had a request about that and I think it's important that everybody

06:02.560 --> 06:08.800
can use Tableau Noir so you can flip also the cursor.

06:08.800 --> 06:19.520
You can add text and also later formula in your lecture.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.080
So now let's talk about manettes.

06:21.080 --> 06:26.020
So manettes are things you can move on the board.

06:26.020 --> 06:36.800
So you can for instance explain the sort algorithms directly in Tableau Noir by moving the manettes.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.960
Actually you also have manettes from OpenMoji.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.520
This is a very nice project.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.280
I accidentally went on this.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.960
It's all like icons for.

06:51.960 --> 06:59.160
And Tableau Noir provides these icons in the interface so you can use this little picture

06:59.160 --> 07:03.160
for whatever you want.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.020
You can make interactive diagrams.

07:07.020 --> 07:13.960
So for instance you can draw graphs where the manettes are the nodes and you have edges

07:13.960 --> 07:16.440
that you have drawn by hand.

07:16.440 --> 07:27.480
And then interestingly you can move the manettes and the graph will be updated accordingly.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.360
You can also put a manette in the background.

07:30.360 --> 07:38.560
So if you have a grid and you want to draw on the top of the grid so you can transform

07:38.560 --> 07:44.680
that into a manette and then put the manettes in the background by pressing B and then you

07:44.680 --> 07:52.120
can draw on the top and especially when you erase you will not erase the grid.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.880
Otherwise you have to redraw it and it's boring.

07:57.880 --> 08:04.120
Let's talk now about the collaborative aspect of Tableau Noir.

08:04.120 --> 08:09.880
So interestingly if you are alone, if you use Tableau Noir alone, there is no communication

08:09.880 --> 08:11.720
with the server.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.320
Nothing.

08:13.320 --> 08:18.000
You're not just loading the HTML file and JavaScript otherwise.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.280
Then during the interaction there is no communication with the server.

08:21.280 --> 08:29.640
But as long as you click on this button which is here, you will share the board, right?

08:29.640 --> 08:32.840
And then it will contact the server.

08:32.840 --> 08:40.440
So in the Tableau Noir.github.io, the official address, it will contact the server that is

08:40.440 --> 08:43.080
located in my lab in REN.

08:43.080 --> 08:51.240
And it will create a shared board and you can share the URL with others.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.240
And then when you share the URL, they are all connected and when you draw something

08:55.240 --> 08:59.520
you have messages that are passing and giving the information that has been done on the

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
board.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.040
That's somehow how it's implemented.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.600
So the server is written in JavaScript.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.160
It's very small in Node.js.

09:10.160 --> 09:17.040
And the client, so it's a bundle file and the entire project is written in TypeScript.

09:17.040 --> 09:25.320
Using some libraries to, yeah, I don't have the list here but, no.

09:25.320 --> 09:30.960
So the features of the, when you share the board, so you have no account, you can protect

09:30.960 --> 09:32.280
a board with a password.

09:32.280 --> 09:39.480
So by protect I mean some users may not have the right to draw on the blackboard.

09:39.480 --> 09:44.280
They only have the right to see the blackboard.

09:44.280 --> 09:50.120
And those data are stored on the server so it means if everybody is stopping the session,

09:50.120 --> 09:56.840
sorry for that, data are lost, so you have to save manually the blackboard when you want

09:56.840 --> 09:59.240
to.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.840
Ah, there is no zoom.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
Why?

10:03.840 --> 10:07.720
Because suppose we have zoom on a blackboard.

10:07.720 --> 10:13.920
If somebody is writing something, for instance, okay, everything is okay.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.960
And the other person is writing hello.

10:17.960 --> 10:23.080
But this person is not seeing it because the zoom is not the same.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.480
So if you introduce zoom, you will get troubles.

10:26.480 --> 10:32.480
So that's why we decided not to have zoom.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.240
So the solution, if you don't have zoom, everybody is seeing the same thing.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.960
We are happy and that's it.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.600
Okay.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.920
So with this tool actually, so this is a kind of new feature that has been added afterwards.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.840
We can now make presentation with tableau noir.

10:53.840 --> 11:01.800
And actually the presentation that you are seeing is made in tableau noir.

11:01.800 --> 11:10.640
So actually, so it's not completely clear, but it's like we have another way to do presentations.

11:10.640 --> 11:14.880
So I will divide the way to make presentation in three.

11:14.880 --> 11:20.000
You have Librefist style, Lattech Bimmer style and tableau noir.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So how do you make animations?

11:24.000 --> 11:30.880
In Librefist, you have to navigate through a lot of menus to see, ah, I want to move

11:30.880 --> 11:36.680
this on the left, coming from the right and so on.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.640
Okay.

11:39.640 --> 11:46.360
In Lattech, you have to write, sorry, I write this type of codes many times.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.400
You have to write some obscure code to encode animations.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.600
You can say, ah, this is on the slide, not on the next slide and so on.

11:54.600 --> 11:59.920
And kind of in tableau noir, you just do it.

11:59.920 --> 12:04.960
So maybe we can make a demo.

12:04.960 --> 12:09.760
We have one minute for the demo.

12:09.760 --> 12:15.960
So let's suppose we are at the first demo.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.000
And we want to explain how we arrive at the first demo.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.840
So there is a little cat.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.840
This is not a cat.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.920
This is the cat, no?

12:25.920 --> 12:26.920
Okay.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.800
This is my first slide, okay?

12:31.800 --> 12:34.800
So now I create a new slide from here.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.160
Boom.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.280
And we have this cat.

12:38.280 --> 12:42.040
And this cat is going to the first demo.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.640
Okay.

12:43.640 --> 12:47.000
So now we have two slides, this one and this one.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.320
Okay.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.800
Now maybe we create a new slide where we erase everything.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.680
And you have, I don't know, this.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
I am improving.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.280
Sorry.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.960
Maybe if you have ideas, don't hesitate.

12:59.960 --> 13:00.960
T-shirt.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.960
Ah, T-shirt.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
Okay.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.960
So we have a T-shirt.

13:04.960 --> 13:13.520
And the cat.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.600
And then, so this is a slide, right?

13:17.600 --> 13:24.000
And then it takes the T-shirt and goes home.

13:24.000 --> 13:38.080
So let's see the presentation.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.640
So hello, I'm a cat.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.120
I want to go to the first demo.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.560
I enter it.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.000
And I want to have a T-shirt.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.640
So you have a T-shirt here.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.760
The cat is quite happy.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.440
And he gets home with the T-shirt.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.440
Okay.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.840
So conclusion.

13:57.840 --> 14:08.480
So kind of table noir can be summed up.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.200
It fits the teachers and students' need.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.440
Plus the kiss principle, keep it simple, stupid.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.880
Plus a bit of nostalgia.

14:16.880 --> 14:23.160
You have the real blackboard aspects, which is not completely clean, but you have like

14:23.160 --> 14:24.160
of dust.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.600
Dust that is a bit of dust.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
Yes.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.600
Video game aspects with a circular menu.

14:32.600 --> 14:39.680
With also, like if you draw something very far like this, you will have the overview

14:39.680 --> 14:42.840
of the map of the board.

14:42.840 --> 14:48.440
So kind of Zelda games or whatever.

14:48.440 --> 14:54.040
So now I am tempted to add new features.

14:54.040 --> 14:59.120
But this is the opposite of kiss.

14:59.120 --> 15:06.200
So I would be very glad to discuss with you about some features that I would like to add.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.200
And that's it.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.920
Thank you for your attention.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.920
Thank you.

15:11.920 --> 15:18.080
Really cool project.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.280
I think we all agree.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
So thank you.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.000
Thanks a lot for the presentation.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.760
And if you guys have any questions, feel free to grab them outside and ask your questions.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
Thank you.

15:28.760 --> 15:49.440
Thank you.
