1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.960
The stage is yours.

2
0:00:06.960 --> 0:00:09.460
Thank you.

3
0:00:09.460 --> 0:00:11.520
I'm here for quite a short time.

4
0:00:11.520 --> 0:00:17.180
My head may not have switched completely to English, so if that happens, maybe someone

5
0:00:17.180 --> 0:00:19.280
of the audience can help me out.

6
0:00:19.280 --> 0:00:22.580
So my talk is about Web access.

7
0:00:22.580 --> 0:00:28.720
And in the last time I had a talk, after the talk, people said to me, you need to tell

8
0:00:28.720 --> 0:00:32.760
more about Web access, so that's what I'll be doing.

9
0:00:32.760 --> 0:00:35.560
First wake up.

10
0:00:35.560 --> 0:00:36.560
Some color.

11
0:00:36.560 --> 0:00:37.560
What is Web access?

12
0:00:37.560 --> 0:00:45.880
Web access, I'm a manager of a workshop in Berlin, in a university.

13
0:00:45.880 --> 0:00:49.240
Some people call me the product owner or the father of Web access.

14
0:00:49.240 --> 0:00:51.760
It's not really the case.

15
0:00:51.760 --> 0:00:56.840
I'll tell later why.

16
0:00:56.840 --> 0:01:00.480
Using machines in a workshop sounds easy.

17
0:01:00.480 --> 0:01:04.920
You switch one bit on, machine is on, switch one bit off, reset the bit, and the machine

18
0:01:04.920 --> 0:01:06.920
is off.

19
0:01:06.920 --> 0:01:12.960
But it's not that easy.

20
0:01:12.960 --> 0:01:16.600
First thing, why do we need to switch off machines?

21
0:01:16.600 --> 0:01:22.000
In a workshop you have two kinds of machines, the one who tear off parts of the body of

22
0:01:22.000 --> 0:01:31.880
the users if they do not know how to use the machine, and the not so interesting ones who

23
0:01:31.880 --> 0:01:35.120
are not hurting people.

24
0:01:35.120 --> 0:01:38.280
And there are two kinds of people in your workshop.

25
0:01:38.280 --> 0:01:44.960
There are the ones who know how to clean up their place after they leave the workshop,

26
0:01:44.960 --> 0:01:50.000
and there are the ones who leave the mess to you.

27
0:01:50.000 --> 0:01:56.200
And if you need to get along with this combination of people and machines, you need to get some

28
0:01:56.200 --> 0:01:57.840
structure in the workshop.

29
0:01:57.840 --> 0:02:03.480
And I'm the only one working aesthetically in that workshop, so I'm not enough people

30
0:02:03.480 --> 0:02:04.800
to get structure.

31
0:02:04.800 --> 0:02:12.240
And 30 people are using the workshop, so I need support, and I need the wonder of the

32
0:02:12.240 --> 0:02:15.080
digitalization.

33
0:02:15.080 --> 0:02:26.760
So I do not like good luck, have fun, that's why we began to work in FabExcess in 2019.

34
0:02:26.760 --> 0:02:28.880
I won't read all of that.

35
0:02:28.880 --> 0:02:34.120
These are requirements which are coming into software if you want to switch on machines

36
0:02:34.120 --> 0:02:36.280
and off machines.

37
0:02:36.280 --> 0:02:38.080
That's why it wasn't that easy.

38
0:02:38.080 --> 0:02:51.800
And next thing is we saw a lot of projects who began working in that area.

39
0:02:51.800 --> 0:02:57.720
But when we realized there are a lot of these, no, where's the picture?

40
0:02:57.720 --> 0:03:01.040
There are a lot of these projects.

41
0:03:01.040 --> 0:03:13.320
I think most of you know that XKCD, we tried to avoid that by becoming modular and getting

42
0:03:13.320 --> 0:03:16.120
more than works for me.

43
0:03:16.120 --> 0:03:21.800
Technology readiness level nine, maybe some of you know what that means.

44
0:03:21.800 --> 0:03:33.240
And that's one more thing we wanted to reach, we wanted to reach the technical for Federation

45
0:03:33.240 --> 0:03:34.240
in the future.

46
0:03:34.240 --> 0:03:40.320
Not right now, we'll get there in September this year maybe.

47
0:03:40.320 --> 0:03:42.720
That's what it is, FabExcess.

48
0:03:42.720 --> 0:03:47.280
In the last talk they said, talk about what is FabExcess, that's it.

49
0:03:47.280 --> 0:03:54.520
We have users and the machines can be switched on by the user, not by the manager of the

50
0:03:54.520 --> 0:04:00.440
FabLab, but the manager of the FabLab has the user database and the machine database

51
0:04:00.440 --> 0:04:04.800
and can say who was allowed to switch on which machine.

52
0:04:04.800 --> 0:04:10.760
And in the next step here, can see which one of the users switched on which machine in

53
0:04:10.760 --> 0:04:14.640
the last time.

54
0:04:14.640 --> 0:04:20.560
And that's it, we do not follow our users or make surveillance of what they are doing,

55
0:04:20.560 --> 0:04:24.280
we want to know who left that mess.

56
0:04:24.280 --> 0:04:27.240
And that's it.

57
0:04:27.240 --> 0:04:39.080
There are, in the time, there are some perspectives which need to be implemented in such software.

58
0:04:39.080 --> 0:04:42.000
First is the workspace manager.

59
0:04:42.000 --> 0:04:47.680
I won't read because time is running.

60
0:04:47.680 --> 0:04:52.760
For the workspace manager, the software we are implementing should fit into his workspace

61
0:04:52.760 --> 0:04:57.160
and not press his workspace into our software.

62
0:04:57.160 --> 0:05:00.280
That's one of the most important things for us.

63
0:05:00.280 --> 0:05:07.720
And for the user, it should be easy to use and that's it, fast and clear as, and at,

64
0:05:07.720 --> 0:05:11.080
no, English word is missing.

65
0:05:11.080 --> 0:05:30.280
So that's how we approached to, well, you know what I mean.

66
0:05:30.280 --> 0:05:31.280
Sorry.

67
0:05:31.280 --> 0:05:40.400
How to consider the wishes of the FabLab manager, yes, of me.

68
0:05:40.400 --> 0:05:42.920
I think it's too much text for nine minutes.

69
0:05:42.920 --> 0:05:46.960
Are there some questions for that slide?

70
0:05:46.960 --> 0:05:50.960
I think the most important is the last one, attaching new machines is easy for Python

71
0:05:50.960 --> 0:05:57.960
and bash because we are not able to implement as a project each and every machine in each

72
0:05:57.960 --> 0:06:05.320
and every workshop, so we need to enable the workshop users and managers to work as a community

73
0:06:05.320 --> 0:06:08.680
project.

74
0:06:08.680 --> 0:06:15.760
In the middle, GUI would be great if there is anyone in the audience who is willing and

75
0:06:15.760 --> 0:06:27.040
able to build a GUI which takes machines and throws out to them and files, feel free.

76
0:06:27.040 --> 0:06:31.200
That's some things in the back end that are important.

77
0:06:31.200 --> 0:06:33.040
It's written in Rust.

78
0:06:33.040 --> 0:06:40.560
So the language and the compiler guarantees some sort of stability.

79
0:06:40.560 --> 0:06:48.880
And in between the back end and Rust, there is the CaptainProto API which enables the

80
0:06:48.880 --> 0:06:54.800
guys who are not working in the back end and in the core of the server to get a stable

81
0:06:54.800 --> 0:07:03.680
API where they can throw against with Python or I think easier languages which are, there

82
0:07:03.680 --> 0:07:13.040
are more people who can write code in these languages.

83
0:07:13.040 --> 0:07:30.760
We have two to three core developers who are having a guarantee of a very, very stable

84
0:07:30.760 --> 0:07:40.080
API and this is also important because the FabLab manager doesn't want to take care of

85
0:07:40.080 --> 0:07:42.360
software updates.

86
0:07:42.360 --> 0:07:48.360
They should happen without any effort.

87
0:07:48.360 --> 0:07:54.080
Accessibility for the users, the app which we have, I showed in the slides before, should

88
0:07:54.080 --> 0:07:57.920
be really accessible for the users because if you have a workshop, it doesn't help you

89
0:07:57.920 --> 0:08:04.200
if a third of your users say, sorry, I can't access the app, I can't use your workshop

90
0:08:04.200 --> 0:08:09.440
machines.

91
0:08:09.440 --> 0:08:18.760
The last line there is one more step to accessibility because not everyone has a mobile phone and

92
0:08:18.760 --> 0:08:23.280
not everyone wants to take his mobile phone and get the app and when he wants to just

93
0:08:23.280 --> 0:08:32.720
use a machine, so NFC is a thing in that case.

94
0:08:32.720 --> 0:08:38.880
Supported hardware devices out of the box, this is what the core developers have been

95
0:08:38.880 --> 0:08:48.840
working at right now and the accessibility are not only the core developers developing

96
0:08:48.840 --> 0:08:56.200
modules for Fab Access, that's where the community comes in.

97
0:08:56.200 --> 0:09:05.400
I think the list on the top will grow with time but the developers have an eye on stability

98
0:09:05.400 --> 0:09:13.480
so it's not growing that fast as the community wishes so it gives community unrights.

99
0:09:13.480 --> 0:09:18.480
I don't know the English word, sorry.

100
0:09:18.480 --> 0:09:19.480
That's where we are right now.

101
0:09:19.480 --> 0:09:29.080
We're in the beta and I think the beginning of March there's a deadline for 1.0 which

102
0:09:29.080 --> 0:09:41.240
will be the first release which can be used by workspace without having software engineering

103
0:09:41.240 --> 0:09:45.240
guys in the background.

104
0:09:45.240 --> 0:09:53.440
These are targets which will be addressed in 1.0 of my connectors which by a lot of

105
0:09:53.440 --> 0:09:58.440
the guys in the community as most of the German workspaces in the

106
0:09:58.440 --> 0:10:05.440
WachstÃ¤ppen switched to a key cloak in the background.

107
0:10:05.440 --> 0:10:12.440
I'm good in time.

108
0:10:12.440 --> 0:10:21.080
The Federation, I already talked to the people of Matrix and I think there will be some interfaces

109
0:10:21.080 --> 0:10:29.840
between Fab Access and Matrix to realize Federation.

110
0:10:29.840 --> 0:10:34.880
Coming to the end of the presentation, the most important are the community members.

111
0:10:34.880 --> 0:10:42.720
We have 64 number growing, we have a community manager, thank you.

112
0:10:42.720 --> 0:10:50.320
We have four people in Berlin, first the core developers, then me, sorry, and one guy in

113
0:10:50.320 --> 0:10:57.720
Bohold who is doing a really good job in alpha testing and documentation because if developers

114
0:10:57.720 --> 0:11:06.400
create documentation it's better when there is someone outside of the developer circle.

115
0:11:06.400 --> 0:11:11.000
Nobody in the team does anything with blockchain, sorry.

116
0:11:11.000 --> 0:11:15.880
These are organizations who supported us and are carrying the project.

117
0:11:15.880 --> 0:11:25.160
Yes, the lower even spent some amounts of money, thank you.

118
0:11:25.160 --> 0:11:32.920
These are the URLs you need to get involved and give it a try.

119
0:11:32.920 --> 0:11:36.600
I think we have three minutes, are there questions?

120
0:11:36.600 --> 0:11:37.600
Yeah.

121
0:11:37.600 --> 0:11:46.920
Did you guys think about interoperating with all the existing authorization schemes like

122
0:11:46.920 --> 0:11:49.640
Free IDA for example?

123
0:11:49.640 --> 0:11:55.600
Yes of course, right now they are implementing a summer and there will be many many more.

124
0:11:55.600 --> 0:12:03.560
It's part of the modular design of Fab Access because we do not want to press you into what

125
0:12:03.560 --> 0:12:10.360
we are using if there are authentication systems which are in the market we will implement

126
0:12:10.360 --> 0:12:17.840
them one after the other but if you have wishes feel free to talk to us.

127
0:12:17.840 --> 0:12:18.840
Yeah.

128
0:12:18.840 --> 0:12:23.480
This is maybe a little out of scope but how do you stop people from just unplugging the

129
0:12:23.480 --> 0:12:24.480
shelly?

130
0:12:24.480 --> 0:12:27.200
Ah, very good question, thank you.

131
0:12:27.200 --> 0:12:32.600
You are not able to solve social problems with technology.

132
0:12:32.600 --> 0:12:39.800
Unplugging plugs which switch on and off the machines is I think for me it's a part of

133
0:12:39.800 --> 0:12:44.160
a social problem but there is a technical aspect.

134
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:49.960
Of course the shellies say I am here, I am here, I am here, they have a heartbeat and

135
0:12:49.960 --> 0:12:55.600
if that heartbeat is away so you are in the core of Fab Access realizes all that shelly

136
0:12:55.600 --> 0:12:56.920
is unplugged.

137
0:12:56.920 --> 0:12:59.360
So it's a technical and social problem.

138
0:12:59.360 --> 0:13:04.760
So Fab Access does log a lightness of the shell.

139
0:13:04.760 --> 0:13:07.840
Inside the kernel, yes, inside the backend, yes.

140
0:13:07.840 --> 0:13:14.160
It throws out in the normal configuration into the memory so it's gone and the time

141
0:13:14.160 --> 0:13:22.240
is thrown out a log file and if you need to follow what your users are doing then you

142
0:13:22.240 --> 0:13:27.720
may take that log file and configure Fab Access, give me the log file and push that log file

143
0:13:27.720 --> 0:13:30.840
to ERP systems or whatever you want.

144
0:13:30.840 --> 0:13:36.920
But that's not in the scope of Fab Access.

145
0:13:36.920 --> 0:13:37.920
Any more questions?

146
0:13:37.920 --> 0:13:39.800
One and a half minutes?

147
0:13:39.800 --> 0:13:46.360
Do you have the possibility to also get a signal from the machine to say it's working

148
0:13:46.360 --> 0:13:49.800
or it's voicing?

149
0:13:49.800 --> 0:13:54.720
Next good question, thank you.

150
0:13:54.720 --> 0:13:59.000
It depends, sorry.

151
0:13:59.000 --> 0:14:03.040
Sometimes if the information from the machine is important for Fab Access to switch on and

152
0:14:03.040 --> 0:14:08.240
off machines then we're taking the data into Fab Access.

153
0:14:08.240 --> 0:14:14.720
Normally when there are data from the machine which are not needed to switch on and off

154
0:14:14.720 --> 0:14:19.040
machines because the core point of Fab Access is switching on and off machines and that's

155
0:14:19.040 --> 0:14:21.640
what we are doing good.

156
0:14:21.640 --> 0:14:31.440
If there are any other data in our package there is a MQTT server and maybe a, um, far

157
0:14:31.440 --> 0:14:38.760
by the MQTT server and Fab Access does not need that data, yeah?

158
0:14:38.760 --> 0:14:39.760
37 seconds.

159
0:14:39.760 --> 0:14:45.160
Since you talked about invoicing, next door or laser cut up we have a paper book where

160
0:14:45.160 --> 0:14:50.600
you wrote down like I used it for like one minute and 30 seconds.

161
0:14:50.600 --> 0:14:53.560
Is this something you can do with that?

162
0:14:53.560 --> 0:14:58.000
This is something you can do with the log file which is coming out of Fab Access and

163
0:14:58.000 --> 0:15:04.720
your own software, you writing or maybe a duo or any other ERP system which needs to

164
0:15:04.720 --> 0:15:08.080
be filled with structured data from that log file.

165
0:15:08.080 --> 0:15:10.680
So you don't want it in Fab Access?

166
0:15:10.680 --> 0:15:16.560
No we are not an ERP system, we are not gaining money from people using our machines.

167
0:15:16.560 --> 0:15:19.080
That's in the scope of different software packages.

168
0:15:19.080 --> 0:15:20.480
Yep.
