WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:04.780 --> 00:06.780
Thank you.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.400
So, it's time. Okay. Hello, everyone. So we have here

00:13.400 --> 00:17.840
Benjamin Jamie who will be sharing should there be a

00:17.840 --> 00:21.340
standard and Libra localization. Ideas on how to make it easy

00:21.340 --> 00:23.440
for translators to contribute to any FOSS project they like.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.440
Thank you, Benjamin.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.440
Thank you.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.440
Thank you for the applause. I didn't deserve that yet.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.440
Definitely. Thank you for being in such a large count here.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.440
So, I'm Benjamin. I work in Weblade. I do the talking there.

00:44.440 --> 00:48.440
And you can also meet Michal in this lovely hoodie here.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.440
And he's the mind behind the coat and everything. And the

00:54.440 --> 00:56.440
founder.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.440
I won't be talking much about Weblade here. That's the talk

01:00.440 --> 01:04.440
tomorrow in translation's dev room. Here I would like to share

01:04.440 --> 01:07.440
a story and kick off something probably that could become a

01:07.440 --> 01:09.440
standard in Libra localization.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.440
Because at the moment, it's nothing like that there.

01:16.440 --> 01:20.440
At first, I would like to talk a short start of Weblade story.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.440
It doesn't start like a master minded start-up plan that will

01:24.440 --> 01:28.440
get a lot of money and conquer the world of the localization.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.440
No, that's other companies. We are Libra software from the

01:31.440 --> 01:35.440
start. And Michal actually started it when he was working

01:35.440 --> 01:41.440
at SUSE. And now SUSE people are very proud that they started

01:41.440 --> 01:47.440
it during the SUSE hack week 12 years ago. Sorry, 11 years ago.

01:47.440 --> 01:56.440
And for a long time, this is the office. It was actually the

01:56.440 --> 02:00.440
office at the top of the building of those large concrete

02:00.440 --> 02:04.440
buildings you have around the Czech Republic built in

02:04.440 --> 02:11.440
socialism. And when you needed an elevator there, there was

02:11.440 --> 02:15.440
those like small on some side of the building. And then you

02:15.440 --> 02:18.440
put all the machinery for your elevator. But it's not needed

02:18.440 --> 02:22.440
now. So all the machinery is downstairs in the shaft. And

02:22.440 --> 02:26.440
Michal had his office on the top of the building. And it's like

02:26.440 --> 02:29.440
three to four meters or something like that. And that's

02:29.440 --> 02:35.440
how he started it. And it was not aimed to do something that

02:31.440 --> 02:37.440
supported. And it was a very good idea to do that. And it

02:35.440 --> 02:37.440
will be master minded and well-

02:37.440 --> 02:42.440
was a very good idea to do that. And it was a very good idea to

02:42.440 --> 02:46.440
do that. And it was a very good idea to do that. And it was

02:46.440 --> 02:52.440
master minded and well-prepared for all the use cases. It was

02:52.440 --> 02:57.440
just in the start, the use case that Michal wanted something

02:57.440 --> 03:02.440
better than Puthu, which was very popular tool but no longer

03:02.440 --> 03:07.440
maintained. And something that's very tightly integrated with

03:07.440 --> 03:12.440
Puthu is that much of the money will work. And you are a

03:12.440 --> 03:16.440
developer. So you connect Weblight to your version control

03:16.440 --> 03:19.440
system and it just works. You don't have to care about

03:19.440 --> 03:22.440
anything. And then everything is in the editor. And you know

03:22.440 --> 03:27.440
localization editors from Weblight and from other similar

03:27.440 --> 03:33.440
tools. And then more and more big open source projects and

03:33.440 --> 03:38.440
other companies went to ask Michal, hey, we would like to use

03:38.440 --> 03:44.440
it. Can we pay you for supporting it? And yeah, that's

03:44.440 --> 03:50.440
how Weblight started getting bigger. And these days there

03:50.440 --> 03:57.440
are large or small Libra projects that are using Weblight.

03:57.440 --> 04:03.440
And oh, sorry, I forgot to put a pen pot logo there. We'll do

04:03.440 --> 04:10.440
tomorrow. But there is Kaledis. And more and more Libra

04:10.440 --> 04:16.440
projects started using it. And it became some sort of a go

04:16.440 --> 04:21.440
for tool. And then Fedora came, I think, three years back to

04:21.440 --> 04:26.440
us and migrated all their stuff from Xanata, from their

04:26.440 --> 04:31.440
original platform they created to Weblight because Xanata was

04:31.440 --> 04:34.440
like we don't have time for that. That's not our core of

04:34.440 --> 04:40.440
business. So we won't use Weblight. And that's how we

04:40.440 --> 04:44.440
realized that this is maybe the thing that will be happening

04:44.440 --> 04:51.440
more. And it became our responsibility. We took very

04:51.440 --> 04:56.440
seriously to give the tool to the communities that they can

04:56.440 --> 05:00.440
use happily and they can contribute to. But it's still

05:00.440 --> 05:05.440
just one platform. It's Weblight. And we created last

05:05.440 --> 05:10.440
year a page called Discover Weblight. So if you are on a

05:10.440 --> 05:14.440
hosted Weblight, if you have your projects on a hosted Weblight

05:14.440 --> 05:18.440
which is the largest instance of Weblight on the Internet, it's

05:18.440 --> 05:22.440
easier to search there. And it will be even easier throughout

05:22.440 --> 05:26.440
this year because of the development. And if you host

05:26.440 --> 05:36.440
yourself your instance, we wanted to give the users a place

05:36.440 --> 05:40.440
where they can come and search through all the Weblight

05:40.440 --> 05:45.440
instances that are open to contribute to this page. So at

05:45.440 --> 05:50.440
the end of the project, you can find if the project is using

05:50.440 --> 05:54.440
Weblight, you have this place and you can search for your

05:54.440 --> 05:58.440
project name, let's say, and you will be guided to the right

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
place. And you can contribute to the localizations there. But

06:02.440 --> 06:06.440
what about if the project, because there are so many

06:06.440 --> 06:11.440
projects in the world that are not using Weblight yet or they

06:11.440 --> 06:15.440
are not using Weblight, it's always your choice. What do you

06:15.440 --> 06:29.440
use in your community? Sorry. So there became an idea. And I

06:29.440 --> 06:33.440
think two years back, and that's really important to say, the

06:33.440 --> 06:38.440
time frame, I was speaking with Dwayne. Dwayne is a wonderful

06:38.440 --> 06:42.440
guy who works with the Weblight. And he is a great developer

06:42.440 --> 06:47.440
to translate toolkit, which is one of the core components that

06:47.440 --> 06:53.440
Weblight uses to work with translation files. And Dwayne

06:53.440 --> 06:57.440
is, yeah, very talkative like I am. So we were talking a lot.

06:57.440 --> 07:04.440
And then I told him, yeah, and maybe there should be a way for

07:04.440 --> 07:08.440
like one place possibly federated,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.560
so it's not in one central place,

07:11.560 --> 07:16.400
where I as a translator of a Libra software,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.600
that's not technically savvy,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.560
and I want to contribute the time

07:20.560 --> 07:22.360
to the project of my choice,

07:22.360 --> 07:27.360
but I don't want to search through readme's and wikis

07:27.760 --> 07:32.540
because every project has its own different way,

07:32.540 --> 07:33.880
or there is no information,

07:33.880 --> 07:36.640
and you have to really dig hard to find it,

07:36.640 --> 07:38.840
or if you are at FOSDEM,

07:38.840 --> 07:41.240
you can walk around the booth

07:41.240 --> 07:45.680
and see a little bit like a little advertisement

07:45.680 --> 07:49.200
or small stand that says this project

07:49.200 --> 07:50.840
is localized on WebLite,

07:50.840 --> 07:54.920
but if you are in the online world,

07:54.920 --> 07:59.200
you will spend usually a lot of time to find

07:59.200 --> 08:00.320
where is the right place

08:00.320 --> 08:02.440
to localize your favorite software,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.280
and I told that to Dwayne,

08:04.280 --> 08:08.180
and Dwayne said, oh yeah, I had that idea a while before,

08:08.180 --> 08:13.080
and I have it very roughly specified,

08:13.080 --> 08:14.040
and we were talking more,

08:14.040 --> 08:18.220
and then he sent like nine pages long,

08:18.220 --> 08:22.980
nice specification of how it could look like

08:22.980 --> 08:24.200
and how it could work,

08:24.200 --> 08:25.960
and there are so many other features

08:25.960 --> 08:27.920
that we would like to have there,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.960
but that was two years ago,

08:30.960 --> 08:32.200
and nothing happened,

08:32.200 --> 08:37.200
because there is no time to do that

08:38.680 --> 08:40.960
in WebLite team,

08:40.960 --> 08:45.560
and it should be a community thing.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.560
It shouldn't be something that WebLite says,

08:49.560 --> 08:51.680
this is the thing, how you should do it,

08:51.680 --> 08:53.280
and everybody should use it.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.120
It can be like that,

08:54.120 --> 08:55.680
but we are at FOSDEM,

08:55.680 --> 08:59.280
there are so many wonderfully skilled people

08:59.280 --> 09:03.440
that may be interested in not only helping

09:03.440 --> 09:05.280
with the actual development,

09:05.280 --> 09:07.580
but also sharing their ideas,

09:07.580 --> 09:09.800
and maybe they,

09:09.800 --> 09:13.960
because it's such obvious thing that's missing,

09:13.960 --> 09:16.320
maybe there are so many people

09:16.320 --> 09:18.760
that already have similar ideas

09:18.760 --> 09:20.640
or some kind of specification,

09:20.640 --> 09:23.240
and I would like to use this talk

09:23.240 --> 09:26.360
if you have an idea,

09:26.360 --> 09:28.080
I just want to kick it off,

09:28.080 --> 09:30.200
we are not working on it yet,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.240
we just want to connect,

09:32.240 --> 09:33.800
we want to discuss,

09:33.800 --> 09:37.040
and maybe in a year on next FOSDEM,

09:37.040 --> 09:38.680
we will have something like that,

09:38.680 --> 09:43.000
and a lot of projects could use that,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.480
or every project on FOSDEM,

09:46.480 --> 09:50.240
and it shouldn't be just about WebLite,

09:50.240 --> 09:51.960
it should be maybe a file,

09:51.960 --> 09:56.520
like you have a license file in your repository,

09:56.520 --> 09:57.680
or a readme file,

09:57.680 --> 09:59.840
that can be indexed by some tool,

09:59.840 --> 10:04.400
so if I want to have an instance,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.640
a server where I could guide,

10:07.760 --> 10:09.760
let's say I'm a localization lab,

10:09.760 --> 10:12.720
or some other lovely group of people

10:12.720 --> 10:15.620
that wants to localize open source software,

10:15.620 --> 10:18.000
they can use some kind of tool,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.560
put it on their website on their own server,

10:20.560 --> 10:23.740
and tell if you have your time,

10:23.740 --> 10:26.320
select a language you want to contribute to,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.120
and find your project,

10:28.120 --> 10:33.120
and this might should index those readmes,

10:33.640 --> 10:35.620
or translation MD files,

10:35.620 --> 10:37.980
from not only GitHub and GitLab,

10:37.980 --> 10:40.840
but probably more and more.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.200
Can it be done?

10:44.200 --> 10:47.040
Probably yes, it will have some limits,

10:47.040 --> 10:50.160
it probably won't scan all the repositories in the world,

10:50.160 --> 10:51.200
that's not possible,

10:51.200 --> 10:54.920
but maybe we can make something bigger

10:54.920 --> 10:56.680
than Discover Web Light,

10:56.680 --> 11:01.480
that's universal use for everyone.

11:02.600 --> 11:07.600
What should it do is to guide the translator

11:07.960 --> 11:10.120
to the right platform, to the right place,

11:10.120 --> 11:13.140
because if I'm a translator,

11:13.140 --> 11:18.140
I don't know all the technical way of the localization,

11:19.200 --> 11:20.920
which can be made easier

11:20.920 --> 11:25.140
by localization management software like Web Light.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.920
I just want to translate my hello to hello,

11:29.920 --> 11:31.120
and that's it.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.560
It should be unified, so everybody can use it.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.820
It should be possible to index it somehow,

11:39.820 --> 11:41.640
to search through it,

11:41.640 --> 11:45.100
and yeah, that's a start,

11:45.100 --> 11:49.400
and probably there is much more that it should do it,

11:49.400 --> 11:52.240
but in a start, this would be nice.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.360
And yeah, let's discuss.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.600
If you go, not right now,

11:58.600 --> 12:01.720
because I have to add a link once I finish the talk,

12:01.720 --> 12:05.040
but this is the place where you can go

12:05.040 --> 12:08.820
and search through Web Light schedule.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.120
I just double check.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.560
Yeah, it's right, there is no misclick.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.800
So if you go there, you can see all the schedule,

12:17.800 --> 12:21.700
all the plans as Web Light have for this post-em,

12:21.700 --> 12:24.140
I will add their link to the discussion,

12:24.140 --> 12:28.560
and you can join, you can share it with your friends

12:28.560 --> 12:31.000
that are interested in such things,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.880
and maybe we will come up with something interesting

12:34.880 --> 12:39.880
for every possible translator in the Libre community,

12:40.760 --> 12:44.160
or in ideal way, this tool,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.600
or this localization file,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.200
or translation entity, whatever we will call it,

12:50.200 --> 12:55.200
can welcome new translators

12:56.180 --> 12:58.460
that don't feel I'm a translator

12:58.460 --> 13:02.720
and then don't know how to get there,

13:02.720 --> 13:06.240
maybe to make it easy for everyone.

13:06.240 --> 13:11.240
So that's it, that's what I wanted to share with you,

13:11.240 --> 13:16.240
and yeah, I'm interested in what do you think,

13:18.080 --> 13:20.520
maybe we still have three minutes

13:20.520 --> 13:22.200
so we can talk something.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.640
Right now, you can also, if you go to that link,

13:27.880 --> 13:31.620
you can also find our BO stickers, T-shirts,

13:31.620 --> 13:34.040
and yeah, other things,

13:34.040 --> 13:36.980
and you can share your ideas there about Web Light

13:36.980 --> 13:38.900
and what we should include,

13:38.900 --> 13:42.600
and if you don't like something, just come there and tell us,

13:42.600 --> 13:45.600
or you can join the online discussion

13:45.600 --> 13:48.840
that will be ready in a few minutes,

13:48.840 --> 13:52.080
and yeah, thank you for your attention,

13:52.080 --> 13:54.740
and if anybody has a question or anything,

13:54.740 --> 13:59.740
just raise your hand or come here and tell it to us.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.480
Thank you for your time, and enjoy your first time.

14:02.480 --> 14:09.480
Thank you.
