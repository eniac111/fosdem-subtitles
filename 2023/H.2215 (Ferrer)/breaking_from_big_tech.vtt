00:00.000 --> 00:10.320
Everyone, we have Boris and Rado here, and they will be providing a talk on breaking

00:10.320 --> 00:16.320
away from Big Tech using open source infrastructure in a convenient way.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.320
Thank you.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.320
Thank you.

00:18.320 --> 00:23.360
So, as mentioned, today we'll be talking about how to break away from Big Tech, and we will

00:23.360 --> 00:29.840
be focusing mostly on small and medium teams, but what we're talking about applies more

00:29.840 --> 00:31.640
broadly as well.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.260
So a little bit about us.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.260
My name is Boris.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.840
And I'm Redon.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
Yep.

00:36.840 --> 00:42.240
We've been open source activists for a couple of years involved in different projects.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.840
And yeah.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.080
Okay.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.560
So to start off, let's talk about Big Tech.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.280
So any fans of Big Tech here?

00:52.280 --> 00:53.280
Show of hands.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.280
Okay.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.280
No?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.440
This was not expected.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.440
So okay.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.440
So there are many issues with Big Tech.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.800
We're going to focus on some of them really fast and will not say probably annoy you with

01:04.800 --> 01:09.200
things that you already know or hate.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.800
But one thing that sends out is that the amount of money these people have, it's like in

01:13.800 --> 01:15.440
the beginning was millions.

01:15.440 --> 01:19.280
Some decades ago, now it's trillions.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.880
It's billions now, and millions, millions, and now it's trillions.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.800
So it's probably the market accumulation or wealth accumulation is more than the entire

01:27.800 --> 01:31.500
GDP of France if you gather all around all these.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.200
And that's just in the first quarter of 2022.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.580
2021, one year ago.

01:35.580 --> 01:42.200
So probably more money are printed and they're not going anywhere close to here, right?

01:42.200 --> 01:47.600
Which is, and money is not the issue here, but money also brings power, which is a major

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
problem.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.960
So in the beginning of the 70s, as you know, the big oil companies were the one who had

01:52.960 --> 01:56.360
all this market capital and growth.

01:56.360 --> 02:03.880
Of course, Disney with its nice copyright lobbying issues and Warner Brothers, just

02:03.880 --> 02:08.240
like Disney, but less efficient in terms of copyright things, as you know.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.760
But again, we're talking about trillions.

02:10.760 --> 02:18.880
And one thing that concerned us a lot is that we've seen many of open source organizations

02:18.880 --> 02:25.360
or companies that are in open source that they do not use.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.360
They don't do that.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.720
The one thing called that we say it's dogfooding.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.400
They don't use other open source tools for their own infrastructure.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.000
And they do this out of conveniences, you know, because when services like Gmail started,

02:38.000 --> 02:45.080
they were giving away this service for free, free as not as in freedom, which brought a

02:45.080 --> 02:48.520
lot of people into these platforms.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.080
Gmail is only one of them, right?

02:51.080 --> 02:55.800
And this was the main problem because they could afford, because all of this market capital

02:55.800 --> 03:00.720
that they had, they could afford giving all these services for free.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.000
And of course, they also killed a lot of innovative stuff.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.680
I'm not saying that Instagram is innovative, but as you know, they bought Amazon is one

03:09.680 --> 03:11.080
of these good examples.

03:11.080 --> 03:17.520
They're buying everything that is around and which they consider a threat, a threat, which

03:17.520 --> 03:21.560
might be a very innovative product at some point.

03:21.560 --> 03:27.640
And one of the scholars, Tim Wu, mentioned that this kind of formula, but by purchasing

03:27.640 --> 03:34.120
other companies that can be considered competitive, this is anti-innovative, right?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.760
And create oligopoly kill zones.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.360
Okay, you know all of this.

03:39.360 --> 03:45.640
But the question is, why do a lot of these organizations, small teams or medium teams,

03:45.640 --> 03:49.760
continue to use this kind of big tech platforms?

03:49.760 --> 03:55.480
And even more specifically, how come that in the open source community, we are so reliant

03:55.480 --> 03:58.120
upon big tech infrastructure?

03:58.120 --> 04:00.400
And there's a couple of different reasons for that.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.840
For sure, one of them is the fact that they are free as in premium and not free as in

04:04.840 --> 04:06.200
freedom.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.800
And this makes it very convenient to sign up with them.

04:09.800 --> 04:16.880
Also the fact that they integrate their services with one another very tightly, at first makes

04:16.880 --> 04:20.920
us believe that it makes us more efficient in what we want to do.

04:20.920 --> 04:26.600
But in reality, this just leads to a vendor lock-in, where after a few years, it will

04:26.600 --> 04:29.960
be very hard for you to migrate to something else.

04:29.960 --> 04:36.560
So in our daily job, we work on providing digital infrastructure with using open source

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
tools.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.800
And we've seen this, these organizations that are again, are into the open source, open

04:41.800 --> 04:45.120
science or open knowledge world.

04:45.120 --> 04:49.360
These organizations started by using the free model of these platforms.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.680
And because they couldn't move in easily, now they are locked.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.240
And that's why they keep using these platforms.

04:57.240 --> 05:04.760
Yeah, so the solution we think is we're going to talk about it in two parts.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.120
The first part is the ideological side.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.600
And the second part is the more hands-on and practical one.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.760
So there are proposals for this.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.120
One of those, we are just mentioning because we don't have much time, we are just mentioning

05:17.120 --> 05:18.640
one of them.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.060
Usually we say big tech, but why should everybody go big, right?

05:23.060 --> 05:29.000
So we should use small tech, small companies which use open source tools.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.860
There is a small tech foundation founded by, founded some years ago.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.760
And they say that small tech, it should be easy to use, private by default, peer-to-peer,

05:39.760 --> 05:43.960
zero knowledge, non-colonial, personal, share-like, interoperable, non-commercial, inclusive,

05:43.960 --> 05:45.080
a lot of stuff.

05:45.080 --> 05:51.240
Again, I'm pretty sure there are other approaches, but this is only one of them that we want

05:51.240 --> 05:52.240
to mention.

05:52.240 --> 05:58.800
So part two of the solution, or the solutions, is hands-on, the hands-on approach.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.400
What, okay, this is good.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.520
We need to, we want to move away from big tech, but what to do, how to do it technically.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.000
Right.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.280
And the good, but also maybe a little bad thing is that you have a lot of choices as

06:12.280 --> 06:14.980
to how you do this migration.

06:14.980 --> 06:20.840
So we listed the five most important ones that we've seen.

06:20.840 --> 06:26.040
And we want to go over each and every one of them to talk a bit more about them.

06:26.040 --> 06:30.520
So the first option is what we believe will be an ideal world.

06:30.520 --> 06:35.440
And as a sysadmin, I definitely want this to be real, will be where everybody is able

06:35.440 --> 06:39.320
to host their own stuff on their computers.

06:39.320 --> 06:43.960
And this means that everybody does their own deployments, their own maintenance, their

06:43.960 --> 06:47.640
own security optimizations, and so on.

06:47.640 --> 06:52.000
This can work quite good, especially for personal projects.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.760
But when we're speaking about infrastructure for organizations, it can be a bit harder

06:56.760 --> 07:00.200
to maintain as compared to your own personal data.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.580
Case in point, an instance should not be down for an organization, same way it can be down

07:04.580 --> 07:05.680
for you.

07:05.680 --> 07:10.000
So with more users, there is more complexity as well.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.200
And also it depends on who is using it.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.280
Like do it yourself.

07:14.280 --> 07:19.120
For example, I don't have the time to do it for my parents, for example, right?

07:19.120 --> 07:21.160
But I can do it for myself.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.040
And the idea is sometimes it's a very good scenario, sometimes it doesn't work.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.600
For the punk movement in the late 70s, 80s, it worked doing a DIY.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.380
We need to see if it's also going to work for us as well.

07:33.380 --> 07:38.120
But when we talk about DIY, you need to be a bit careful about what we call the Dropbox

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
problem.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.080
And what the Dropbox problem is, is that when Dropbox was initially launched, one of the

07:44.080 --> 07:45.840
first comments on Hacker News was...

07:45.840 --> 07:48.520
This is quite famous, by the way.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.480
Or for some people.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.800
One of the first comments was saying, I don't understand why Dropbox needs to exist, because

07:54.800 --> 07:59.200
you can host your own FTP server and use this and that library to do it.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.720
And yeah, from a technical perspective, you can.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.920
But I think time has shown that most users will not want to host their own FTP server.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.440
Is the person who commented this in the here?

08:10.440 --> 08:16.920
So if not, please don't have this approach when...

08:16.920 --> 08:21.520
Because this is one of the reasons we have so much big tech right now.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.160
Like we say, yes, we can do it.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.160
And if you do all this and you have your own server at your home place and you do this

08:28.160 --> 08:34.440
and you update and you have SSL certificates and FTP and all that stuff, that works.

08:34.440 --> 08:39.160
But for the wider audience, that's a major issue.

08:39.160 --> 08:42.400
So we need to have a different approach when we propose this.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.760
So the second approach that one can take are what we call no-code platforms.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.080
So these are platforms like joingardens.com or Unihost.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.640
And essentially what they do is that they lower the barrier needed to start self-hosting,

08:57.640 --> 09:00.280
because they automate a lot of the processes.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.760
And this is a really great way to not only set up, but also maintain your infrastructure.

09:05.760 --> 09:12.800
However, depending on your specific needs, if you want to do some custom features, it

09:12.800 --> 09:17.480
might be a bit trickier to get them to work exactly the way you want.

09:17.480 --> 09:21.720
But as long as you don't want something very custom, they're a very great way to get started.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.360
And it's a very...

09:23.360 --> 09:29.880
It makes you win a lot of time from the first solution, which is self-hosting, because you

09:29.880 --> 09:34.240
have lots of the tools that you need to do in order to automate stuff, right?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
Yeah.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.560
So the third option is having an internal team.

09:38.560 --> 09:46.480
So again, if you are an organization promoting open knowledge, you might either, again, do

09:46.480 --> 09:51.040
it yourself and get all the know-how, but you might also have one system administrator

09:51.040 --> 09:52.960
or team inside.

09:52.960 --> 09:58.360
This is good, because you can deploy things as you want and customize them.

09:58.360 --> 10:05.120
Obviously, there are costs for the hardware or if you go to the cloud, for the...

10:05.120 --> 10:06.800
Also for the team that you're going to go.

10:06.800 --> 10:11.000
If you have the budget that's good, if you don't, that's a tricky one.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.680
You should either go to option one or two or to the other two ones that are like option

10:15.680 --> 10:18.320
four or five.

10:18.320 --> 10:26.240
Hosting collectives are, if you know Chateau, lots of small hosting collectives from France.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.040
They're mainly in France.

10:30.040 --> 10:36.760
And they are mainly focused on the collective side of it, which is great, because it's also

10:36.760 --> 10:39.920
a very good approach of providing solidarity.

10:39.920 --> 10:45.560
Some of them are not-for-profit, some of them are collective, some of them are small companies.

10:45.560 --> 10:52.640
But the idea is to provide a good step, a very easy step for other collectives or other

10:52.640 --> 10:58.480
small companies to have open source infrastructure on their own.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.040
And some of them are very...that we know.

11:02.040 --> 11:07.200
They also provide some training so that it's easier the migration from all these evil platforms

11:07.200 --> 11:09.240
to the new platforms that are using.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.280
We usually tend to...

11:11.280 --> 11:15.680
Lots of people who are technical know how we tend not to...

11:15.680 --> 11:22.400
We tend to underestimate how hard it is to change the routine from one platform to the

11:22.400 --> 11:23.480
other.

11:23.480 --> 11:27.760
And these setups, these collectives are great in doing that.

11:27.760 --> 11:28.760
Yep.

11:28.760 --> 11:34.280
And the solution number four and five are kind of very close together.

11:34.280 --> 11:40.480
But the solution number five is that recently there has been an increasing number of providers

11:40.480 --> 11:43.480
that focus on open source infrastructure.

11:43.480 --> 11:48.720
For example, there's a GitHub repository on Nextcloud called Providers.

11:48.720 --> 11:54.520
And these providers are not officially endorsed by Nextcloud, but they take care of setting

11:54.520 --> 11:57.840
up Nextcloud and maintaining it for you.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
And this is...

11:58.840 --> 12:00.400
Sorry, go back to...

12:00.400 --> 12:06.480
This is great because, for example, the Nextcloud ecosystem has also official partners of Nextcloud.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.600
So if you are a big organization, you just go there.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.160
If you're a small one, you just go to the list and research and do your own.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.000
Or you can do it yourself, as we mentioned before.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.960
Having all these options in a clear way makes it easier for people to just migrate for,

12:21.960 --> 12:27.520
I don't know, for my parents to start using Nextcloud for their photos on their Android

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
phone.

12:28.520 --> 12:34.360
Which, by the way, I should update at some point because they asked them for me to help

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
them.

12:35.360 --> 12:40.120
But it's important to keep in mind that it's not necessarily a one size fits all.

12:40.120 --> 12:45.000
And even if you find something that fits your need, your needs might change in the future.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.080
So it's important to think of these solutions as different alternatives and different steps

12:50.080 --> 12:55.000
that you can take on the journey to have open source infrastructure.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.080
So yeah, about managed service providers, as we mentioned, we think it should be very

13:01.080 --> 13:07.520
important to focus on platforms that are open source, so therefore open platforms.

13:07.520 --> 13:13.280
And with such service providers, usually you don't need to have technical knowledge to

13:13.280 --> 13:14.600
get things up and running.

13:14.600 --> 13:20.960
You need to have some knowledge, which is legal, but also from the provider that you

13:20.960 --> 13:26.520
are choosing, of where your data are, if it's compliant, and all these things.

13:26.520 --> 13:31.620
So you need some basic knowledge to understand what the other side is doing with all your

13:31.620 --> 13:34.080
infrastructure that you are managing, right?

13:34.080 --> 13:39.160
And these providers should also offer you with not just technical support when something

13:39.160 --> 13:44.960
is down, but we believe also with user support, because if you have an infrastructure, but

13:44.960 --> 13:48.320
nobody uses it, what's the point?

13:48.320 --> 13:52.800
And because managed service providers should not be the end goal, the end goal is to everybody

13:52.800 --> 13:54.800
to self host, right?

13:54.800 --> 14:00.160
But until then, we should be able to understand the terms of service to read them, because

14:00.160 --> 14:03.560
somebody else is doing the maintenance and they can do some.

14:03.560 --> 14:08.560
They might have higher expertise, but there are also mistakes that people do usually in

14:08.560 --> 14:10.160
these cases, right?

14:10.160 --> 14:14.520
And so in this case, terms of service are very important, not in this case always.

14:14.520 --> 14:18.720
And also to understand the legal coverage, as I mentioned before, where the servers are,

14:18.720 --> 14:20.560
where they deployed, et cetera, et cetera.

14:20.560 --> 14:25.000
And of course, very important, service continuity.

14:25.000 --> 14:31.840
There are many such service providers that provide open source platforms as managed service

14:31.840 --> 14:36.480
that they popped up, especially some years ago, pop up, they are there, and after like

14:36.480 --> 14:40.680
two years, they say, oh, it didn't work out for us, the pricing that we calculated was

14:40.680 --> 14:42.520
bad, and they shut down.

14:42.520 --> 14:50.080
So you also need to review your service provider if they seem to have a business continuity

14:50.080 --> 14:54.240
and a system to build the plan.

14:54.240 --> 14:58.000
So one example is, for example, Mastodon, right?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
There's a lot of talk about hosting Mastodon these days, et cetera.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.360
So you need to know where to deploy it and what you can do it again.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.760
You can do it yourself, but you can choose someone else to do it for you.

15:07.760 --> 15:13.080
You need to have technical know-how with all the platforms, platform-specific know-how.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.880
What does federation mean, for example?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.120
Or what's the truth?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.600
Legal implications and who does the moderation.

15:19.600 --> 15:25.320
All these things are very, very, very important for you to know.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.840
And five more seconds.

15:27.840 --> 15:34.240
So that's why, for example, for us, it took us months to understand and read a lot of

15:34.240 --> 15:42.680
legal paperwork and also research the platform before deciding to offer it to other people,

15:42.680 --> 15:45.080
which we are planning to do this week.

15:45.080 --> 15:49.840
And this is something that we are announcing just here today.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.840
Yeah.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.000
Something to keep in mind is that regardless of the option that you choose...

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Okay, go on.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Very quick.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.120
Yeah, very quickly.

15:59.120 --> 16:04.840
Be careful to not be vendor-locked in, because that's a very important aspect.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.280
If you want the sticker, we have it around with us so you can get it later.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
Thank you so much.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.280
Thank you for your...

16:11.280 --> 16:29.800
Thank you very much.
