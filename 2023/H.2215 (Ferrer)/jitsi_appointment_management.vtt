00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Hello, I'm Konstantinos Pabadimitriou.

00:09.640 --> 00:16.880
I'm the web developer and analyst from GeForce Open Technology Salients.

00:16.880 --> 00:26.240
I will show you how we combine these appointments with JITC for online appointment management.

00:26.240 --> 00:33.880
In COVID, a lot of private and public services switched to online appointments.

00:33.880 --> 00:44.120
Most of them used closed source services for the online part.

00:44.120 --> 00:52.760
We at GeForce adapted the easy appointments, which is an online software platform for appointment

00:52.760 --> 00:55.400
management in JITC.

00:55.400 --> 01:07.280
An online open source meeting with audio and video, and combined them into a seamless integration

01:07.280 --> 01:17.600
for booking an appointment that will take place online rather than physically.

01:17.600 --> 01:23.880
About our organization, we established in 2008, we are a non-profit organization, and

01:23.880 --> 01:33.240
also we have shareholders, universities, research centers, and public beneficial organizations.

01:33.240 --> 01:40.120
Our objectives are development and promotion of open standards, open software, open content,

01:40.120 --> 01:48.600
open data, open government, open educational resources, creative common license of open

01:48.600 --> 01:55.480
material and design technologies, and also open hardware and design.

01:55.480 --> 02:02.480
We contribute to openness in education, in public sector, and also in private sector.

02:02.480 --> 02:08.560
We have thematic working groups on open software and open standards, open technologies and

02:08.560 --> 02:17.240
education, open governance and open data, open design, open hardware, wireless networks,

02:17.240 --> 02:24.320
information, system security, and personal data protection, and also innovation and entrepreneurship.

02:24.320 --> 02:33.960
Well, the easy appointments part, it's a web application for appointment management.

02:33.960 --> 02:43.040
It has a very easy installation on a web server, and also configuration is simple.

02:43.040 --> 02:50.240
Workers can use it directly without having to install any applications.

02:50.240 --> 02:58.800
The operation is using a web browser, and it works on a computer, on tablet, or mobile

02:58.800 --> 03:04.560
phones since the design is responsive.

03:04.560 --> 03:11.280
It's a really simple and fast operation, optimized without unnecessary options.

03:11.280 --> 03:17.320
Also easy to use environment for managing the appointments from the service side.

03:17.320 --> 03:24.120
It supports over 25 languages, and also since it's open source, anyone can contribute more

03:24.120 --> 03:25.560
languages.

03:25.560 --> 03:34.440
It's written by Greek developer Alex Chelegidis, which actively continues development.

03:34.440 --> 03:43.040
It's open software, open source, and also it has already hundreds of installations around

03:43.040 --> 03:46.360
the world.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.080
It's written in PHP.

03:49.080 --> 03:54.200
It requires PHP 7.4 or above.

03:54.200 --> 04:03.320
It uses MySQL or MariaDB for the database part, runs on N-Zincs or Apache web server,

04:03.320 --> 04:10.480
and uses PDO extensions for JSON, M-B-String, OpenSSL, and PDO.

04:10.480 --> 04:17.040
It's a developer friendly with clean source code.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.040
Now the JITC part.

04:19.040 --> 04:25.760
JITC is a set of open source projects that allow easy teleconferencing.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.680
It's written in Java and JavaScript.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.320
It's compatible with web by RTC.

04:32.320 --> 04:39.640
JITC VideoBridges transmits video and audio to all participants separately, rather than

04:39.640 --> 04:42.720
combining them first.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.640
And of course it's open software.

04:47.640 --> 04:58.720
The platform now, on the first page, if that seems Greek to you, actually it is Greeks.

04:58.720 --> 05:07.200
In the first menu, the user can select the service he wants.

05:07.200 --> 05:13.600
After that, he selects specific agent or any available from the service.

05:13.600 --> 05:20.760
And finally, some information appears about the selected service, the duration of the

05:20.760 --> 05:21.760
appointment.

05:21.760 --> 05:31.160
On the bottom you can select also the interface language.

05:31.160 --> 05:37.760
We added the part that you can also arrange an online appointment.

05:37.760 --> 05:43.080
That's why we, maybe it's the same service, but rather than physically you want to do

05:43.080 --> 05:47.680
it online.

05:47.680 --> 05:57.000
On the second step, you choose the available dates and times of the service you choose.

05:57.000 --> 06:06.520
Or if you select a specific agent, you see his availability or any other agent available,

06:06.520 --> 06:11.120
you will see the calendar here.

06:11.120 --> 06:20.200
And the third step, a user inserts its information, first name, last name, and email, which in

06:20.200 --> 06:27.840
this email you will receive the details of the appointment and also the option to change

06:27.840 --> 06:31.760
or to cancel the appointment.

06:31.760 --> 06:45.720
The fourth step, all the details gathered for the appointment.

06:45.720 --> 06:55.640
And finally, when he submits the appointment, two emails are, he sees a confirmation message

06:55.640 --> 06:57.040
on the browser.

06:57.040 --> 07:05.040
Also the system generates two emails, one for the user with details and also from the

07:05.040 --> 07:11.040
selected agent to the selected service.

07:11.040 --> 07:19.400
The email he receives, again, the confirmation, the details, and also in case it's an online

07:19.400 --> 07:32.800
appointment, on the location field it will appear the unique video link to the DTC service.

07:32.800 --> 07:42.360
Also the user will receive an as an attachment and an ICS file which he can import it to

07:42.360 --> 07:45.400
the calendar.

07:45.400 --> 07:56.400
On the administration side, the agent sees all his meetings with information in an easy

07:56.400 --> 07:58.880
management environment.

07:58.880 --> 08:06.560
Also you have roles in the system so you can have directors of the service which they will

08:06.560 --> 08:14.360
see all the appointments.

08:14.360 --> 08:19.560
Some technical details about our prototype.

08:19.560 --> 08:25.920
We did minimal changes to easy appointments source code.

08:25.920 --> 08:31.560
So it will be also easy to use it.

08:31.560 --> 08:39.400
If the administrator doesn't set a physical location of a service because it's a service

08:39.400 --> 08:44.720
so you say the appointment is on this address or this building, this office.

08:44.720 --> 08:54.520
If this is empty, then the change we did, they generate a unique DTC link using the

08:54.520 --> 08:57.080
appointments hash.

08:57.080 --> 09:03.760
Each appointment has a unique hash in the database so we use this also as a link for

09:03.760 --> 09:06.080
the conference.

09:06.080 --> 09:13.520
We use the native location field to store the DTC link.

09:13.520 --> 09:20.240
We added the location field in the email the user receives.

09:20.240 --> 09:24.800
And administer to some settings.

09:24.800 --> 09:32.400
We also wanted to show some text with information on the homepage which wasn't an option in

09:32.400 --> 09:39.080
the appointment so we also added this and we wanted to change also the appearance.

09:39.080 --> 09:47.840
So we inserted a CSS file which from there you can change colors and some design of the

09:47.840 --> 09:52.040
pages.

09:52.040 --> 10:03.320
The source code is available on the GitHub you see here.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.000
That was our project.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.720
Thank you for coming.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.480
Does anyone have any questions?

10:18.480 --> 10:22.400
Because once further information.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.400
Yes.

10:23.400 --> 10:31.400
I understand that this is a port from the official DTF endpoint.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.400
Yes.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.400
So how do you manage with the new versions?

10:35.400 --> 10:48.080
Do you provide something like automatic combination to add some patches to the main project?

10:48.080 --> 10:51.360
This is a prototype.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.920
We spoke with the developer of his appointments.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.160
He has a system for plug-ins.

10:58.160 --> 11:03.360
So it could be written as a plug-in to his appointments.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.920
At the moment, no.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.640
You change the actual code.

11:08.640 --> 11:20.560
That's why also we wanted to make minimal changes.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.560
Thank you, Konstantinos.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.560
That was fantastic.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.560
Thank you.

11:23.560 --> 11:39.240
Thank you.
