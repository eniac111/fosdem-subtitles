1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:10.320
Everyone, we have Boris and Rado here, and they will be providing a talk on breaking

2
0:00:10.320 --> 0:00:16.320
away from Big Tech using open source infrastructure in a convenient way.

3
0:00:16.320 --> 0:00:17.320
Thank you.

4
0:00:17.320 --> 0:00:18.320
Thank you.

5
0:00:18.320 --> 0:00:23.360
So, as mentioned, today we'll be talking about how to break away from Big Tech, and we will

6
0:00:23.360 --> 0:00:29.840
be focusing mostly on small and medium teams, but what we're talking about applies more

7
0:00:29.840 --> 0:00:31.640
broadly as well.

8
0:00:31.640 --> 0:00:33.260
So a little bit about us.

9
0:00:33.260 --> 0:00:34.260
My name is Boris.

10
0:00:34.260 --> 0:00:35.840
And I'm Redon.

11
0:00:35.840 --> 0:00:36.840
Yep.

12
0:00:36.840 --> 0:00:42.240
We've been open source activists for a couple of years involved in different projects.

13
0:00:42.240 --> 0:00:43.840
And yeah.

14
0:00:43.840 --> 0:00:45.080
Okay.

15
0:00:45.080 --> 0:00:49.560
So to start off, let's talk about Big Tech.

16
0:00:49.560 --> 0:00:52.280
So any fans of Big Tech here?

17
0:00:52.280 --> 0:00:53.280
Show of hands.

18
0:00:53.280 --> 0:00:54.280
Okay.

19
0:00:54.280 --> 0:00:55.280
No?

20
0:00:55.280 --> 0:00:57.440
This was not expected.

21
0:00:57.440 --> 0:01:00.440
So okay.

22
0:01:00.440 --> 0:01:01.440
So there are many issues with Big Tech.

23
0:01:01.440 --> 0:01:04.800
We're going to focus on some of them really fast and will not say probably annoy you with

24
0:01:04.800 --> 0:01:09.200
things that you already know or hate.

25
0:01:09.200 --> 0:01:13.800
But one thing that sends out is that the amount of money these people have, it's like in

26
0:01:13.800 --> 0:01:15.440
the beginning was millions.

27
0:01:15.440 --> 0:01:19.280
Some decades ago, now it's trillions.

28
0:01:19.280 --> 0:01:21.880
It's billions now, and millions, millions, and now it's trillions.

29
0:01:21.880 --> 0:01:27.800
So it's probably the market accumulation or wealth accumulation is more than the entire

30
0:01:27.800 --> 0:01:31.500
GDP of France if you gather all around all these.

31
0:01:31.500 --> 0:01:34.200
And that's just in the first quarter of 2022.

32
0:01:34.200 --> 0:01:35.580
2021, one year ago.

33
0:01:35.580 --> 0:01:42.200
So probably more money are printed and they're not going anywhere close to here, right?

34
0:01:42.200 --> 0:01:47.600
Which is, and money is not the issue here, but money also brings power, which is a major

35
0:01:47.600 --> 0:01:48.600
problem.

36
0:01:48.600 --> 0:01:52.960
So in the beginning of the 70s, as you know, the big oil companies were the one who had

37
0:01:52.960 --> 0:01:56.360
all this market capital and growth.

38
0:01:56.360 --> 0:02:03.880
Of course, Disney with its nice copyright lobbying issues and Warner Brothers, just

39
0:02:03.880 --> 0:02:08.240
like Disney, but less efficient in terms of copyright things, as you know.

40
0:02:08.240 --> 0:02:10.760
But again, we're talking about trillions.

41
0:02:10.760 --> 0:02:18.880
And one thing that concerned us a lot is that we've seen many of open source organizations

42
0:02:18.880 --> 0:02:25.360
or companies that are in open source that they do not use.

43
0:02:25.360 --> 0:02:26.360
They don't do that.

44
0:02:26.360 --> 0:02:28.720
The one thing called that we say it's dogfooding.

45
0:02:28.720 --> 0:02:33.400
They don't use other open source tools for their own infrastructure.

46
0:02:33.400 --> 0:02:38.000
And they do this out of conveniences, you know, because when services like Gmail started,

47
0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:45.080
they were giving away this service for free, free as not as in freedom, which brought a

48
0:02:45.080 --> 0:02:48.520
lot of people into these platforms.

49
0:02:48.520 --> 0:02:51.080
Gmail is only one of them, right?

50
0:02:51.080 --> 0:02:55.800
And this was the main problem because they could afford, because all of this market capital

51
0:02:55.800 --> 0:03:00.720
that they had, they could afford giving all these services for free.

52
0:03:00.720 --> 0:03:05.000
And of course, they also killed a lot of innovative stuff.

53
0:03:05.000 --> 0:03:09.680
I'm not saying that Instagram is innovative, but as you know, they bought Amazon is one

54
0:03:09.680 --> 0:03:11.080
of these good examples.

55
0:03:11.080 --> 0:03:17.520
They're buying everything that is around and which they consider a threat, a threat, which

56
0:03:17.520 --> 0:03:21.560
might be a very innovative product at some point.

57
0:03:21.560 --> 0:03:27.640
And one of the scholars, Tim Wu, mentioned that this kind of formula, but by purchasing

58
0:03:27.640 --> 0:03:34.120
other companies that can be considered competitive, this is anti-innovative, right?

59
0:03:34.120 --> 0:03:35.760
And create oligopoly kill zones.

60
0:03:35.760 --> 0:03:39.360
Okay, you know all of this.

61
0:03:39.360 --> 0:03:45.640
But the question is, why do a lot of these organizations, small teams or medium teams,

62
0:03:45.640 --> 0:03:49.760
continue to use this kind of big tech platforms?

63
0:03:49.760 --> 0:03:55.480
And even more specifically, how come that in the open source community, we are so reliant

64
0:03:55.480 --> 0:03:58.120
upon big tech infrastructure?

65
0:03:58.120 --> 0:04:00.400
And there's a couple of different reasons for that.

66
0:04:00.400 --> 0:04:04.840
For sure, one of them is the fact that they are free as in premium and not free as in

67
0:04:04.840 --> 0:04:06.200
freedom.

68
0:04:06.200 --> 0:04:09.800
And this makes it very convenient to sign up with them.

69
0:04:09.800 --> 0:04:16.880
Also the fact that they integrate their services with one another very tightly, at first makes

70
0:04:16.880 --> 0:04:20.920
us believe that it makes us more efficient in what we want to do.

71
0:04:20.920 --> 0:04:26.600
But in reality, this just leads to a vendor lock-in, where after a few years, it will

72
0:04:26.600 --> 0:04:29.960
be very hard for you to migrate to something else.

73
0:04:29.960 --> 0:04:36.560
So in our daily job, we work on providing digital infrastructure with using open source

74
0:04:36.560 --> 0:04:37.560
tools.

75
0:04:37.560 --> 0:04:41.800
And we've seen this, these organizations that are again, are into the open source, open

76
0:04:41.800 --> 0:04:45.120
science or open knowledge world.

77
0:04:45.120 --> 0:04:49.360
These organizations started by using the free model of these platforms.

78
0:04:49.360 --> 0:04:54.680
And because they couldn't move in easily, now they are locked.

79
0:04:54.680 --> 0:04:57.240
And that's why they keep using these platforms.

80
0:04:57.240 --> 0:05:04.760
Yeah, so the solution we think is we're going to talk about it in two parts.

81
0:05:04.760 --> 0:05:08.120
The first part is the ideological side.

82
0:05:08.120 --> 0:05:11.600
And the second part is the more hands-on and practical one.

83
0:05:11.600 --> 0:05:13.760
So there are proposals for this.

84
0:05:13.760 --> 0:05:17.120
One of those, we are just mentioning because we don't have much time, we are just mentioning

85
0:05:17.120 --> 0:05:18.640
one of them.

86
0:05:18.640 --> 0:05:23.060
Usually we say big tech, but why should everybody go big, right?

87
0:05:23.060 --> 0:05:29.000
So we should use small tech, small companies which use open source tools.

88
0:05:29.000 --> 0:05:36.860
There is a small tech foundation founded by, founded some years ago.

89
0:05:36.860 --> 0:05:39.760
And they say that small tech, it should be easy to use, private by default, peer-to-peer,

90
0:05:39.760 --> 0:05:43.960
zero knowledge, non-colonial, personal, share-like, interoperable, non-commercial, inclusive,

91
0:05:43.960 --> 0:05:45.080
a lot of stuff.

92
0:05:45.080 --> 0:05:51.240
Again, I'm pretty sure there are other approaches, but this is only one of them that we want

93
0:05:51.240 --> 0:05:52.240
to mention.

94
0:05:52.240 --> 0:05:58.800
So part two of the solution, or the solutions, is hands-on, the hands-on approach.

95
0:05:58.800 --> 0:06:00.400
What, okay, this is good.

96
0:06:00.400 --> 0:06:04.520
We need to, we want to move away from big tech, but what to do, how to do it technically.

97
0:06:04.520 --> 0:06:06.000
Right.

98
0:06:06.000 --> 0:06:12.280
And the good, but also maybe a little bad thing is that you have a lot of choices as

99
0:06:12.280 --> 0:06:14.980
to how you do this migration.

100
0:06:14.980 --> 0:06:20.840
So we listed the five most important ones that we've seen.

101
0:06:20.840 --> 0:06:26.040
And we want to go over each and every one of them to talk a bit more about them.

102
0:06:26.040 --> 0:06:30.520
So the first option is what we believe will be an ideal world.

103
0:06:30.520 --> 0:06:35.440
And as a sysadmin, I definitely want this to be real, will be where everybody is able

104
0:06:35.440 --> 0:06:39.320
to host their own stuff on their computers.

105
0:06:39.320 --> 0:06:43.960
And this means that everybody does their own deployments, their own maintenance, their

106
0:06:43.960 --> 0:06:47.640
own security optimizations, and so on.

107
0:06:47.640 --> 0:06:52.000
This can work quite good, especially for personal projects.

108
0:06:52.000 --> 0:06:56.760
But when we're speaking about infrastructure for organizations, it can be a bit harder

109
0:06:56.760 --> 0:07:00.200
to maintain as compared to your own personal data.

110
0:07:00.200 --> 0:07:04.580
Case in point, an instance should not be down for an organization, same way it can be down

111
0:07:04.580 --> 0:07:05.680
for you.

112
0:07:05.680 --> 0:07:10.000
So with more users, there is more complexity as well.

113
0:07:10.000 --> 0:07:12.200
And also it depends on who is using it.

114
0:07:12.200 --> 0:07:14.280
Like do it yourself.

115
0:07:14.280 --> 0:07:19.120
For example, I don't have the time to do it for my parents, for example, right?

116
0:07:19.120 --> 0:07:21.160
But I can do it for myself.

117
0:07:21.160 --> 0:07:26.040
And the idea is sometimes it's a very good scenario, sometimes it doesn't work.

118
0:07:26.040 --> 0:07:30.600
For the punk movement in the late 70s, 80s, it worked doing a DIY.

119
0:07:30.600 --> 0:07:33.380
We need to see if it's also going to work for us as well.

120
0:07:33.380 --> 0:07:38.120
But when we talk about DIY, you need to be a bit careful about what we call the Dropbox

121
0:07:38.120 --> 0:07:39.120
problem.

122
0:07:39.120 --> 0:07:44.080
And what the Dropbox problem is, is that when Dropbox was initially launched, one of the

123
0:07:44.080 --> 0:07:45.840
first comments on Hacker News was...

124
0:07:45.840 --> 0:07:48.520
This is quite famous, by the way.

125
0:07:48.520 --> 0:07:50.480
Or for some people.

126
0:07:50.480 --> 0:07:54.800
One of the first comments was saying, I don't understand why Dropbox needs to exist, because

127
0:07:54.800 --> 0:07:59.200
you can host your own FTP server and use this and that library to do it.

128
0:07:59.200 --> 0:08:01.720
And yeah, from a technical perspective, you can.

129
0:08:01.720 --> 0:08:06.920
But I think time has shown that most users will not want to host their own FTP server.

130
0:08:06.920 --> 0:08:10.440
Is the person who commented this in the here?

131
0:08:10.440 --> 0:08:16.920
So if not, please don't have this approach when...

132
0:08:16.920 --> 0:08:21.520
Because this is one of the reasons we have so much big tech right now.

133
0:08:21.520 --> 0:08:24.160
Like we say, yes, we can do it.

134
0:08:24.160 --> 0:08:28.160
And if you do all this and you have your own server at your home place and you do this

135
0:08:28.160 --> 0:08:34.440
and you update and you have SSL certificates and FTP and all that stuff, that works.

136
0:08:34.440 --> 0:08:39.160
But for the wider audience, that's a major issue.

137
0:08:39.160 --> 0:08:42.400
So we need to have a different approach when we propose this.

138
0:08:42.400 --> 0:08:47.760
So the second approach that one can take are what we call no-code platforms.

139
0:08:47.760 --> 0:08:52.080
So these are platforms like joingardens.com or Unihost.

140
0:08:52.080 --> 0:08:57.640
And essentially what they do is that they lower the barrier needed to start self-hosting,

141
0:08:57.640 --> 0:09:00.280
because they automate a lot of the processes.

142
0:09:00.280 --> 0:09:05.760
And this is a really great way to not only set up, but also maintain your infrastructure.

143
0:09:05.760 --> 0:09:12.800
However, depending on your specific needs, if you want to do some custom features, it

144
0:09:12.800 --> 0:09:17.480
might be a bit trickier to get them to work exactly the way you want.

145
0:09:17.480 --> 0:09:21.720
But as long as you don't want something very custom, they're a very great way to get started.

146
0:09:21.720 --> 0:09:23.360
And it's a very...

147
0:09:23.360 --> 0:09:29.880
It makes you win a lot of time from the first solution, which is self-hosting, because you

148
0:09:29.880 --> 0:09:34.240
have lots of the tools that you need to do in order to automate stuff, right?

149
0:09:34.240 --> 0:09:35.240
Yeah.

150
0:09:35.240 --> 0:09:38.560
So the third option is having an internal team.

151
0:09:38.560 --> 0:09:46.480
So again, if you are an organization promoting open knowledge, you might either, again, do

152
0:09:46.480 --> 0:09:51.040
it yourself and get all the know-how, but you might also have one system administrator

153
0:09:51.040 --> 0:09:52.960
or team inside.

154
0:09:52.960 --> 0:09:58.360
This is good, because you can deploy things as you want and customize them.

155
0:09:58.360 --> 0:10:05.120
Obviously, there are costs for the hardware or if you go to the cloud, for the...

156
0:10:05.120 --> 0:10:06.800
Also for the team that you're going to go.

157
0:10:06.800 --> 0:10:11.000
If you have the budget that's good, if you don't, that's a tricky one.

158
0:10:11.000 --> 0:10:15.680
You should either go to option one or two or to the other two ones that are like option

159
0:10:15.680 --> 0:10:18.320
four or five.

160
0:10:18.320 --> 0:10:26.240
Hosting collectives are, if you know Chateau, lots of small hosting collectives from France.

161
0:10:26.240 --> 0:10:30.040
They're mainly in France.

162
0:10:30.040 --> 0:10:36.760
And they are mainly focused on the collective side of it, which is great, because it's also

163
0:10:36.760 --> 0:10:39.920
a very good approach of providing solidarity.

164
0:10:39.920 --> 0:10:45.560
Some of them are not-for-profit, some of them are collective, some of them are small companies.

165
0:10:45.560 --> 0:10:52.640
But the idea is to provide a good step, a very easy step for other collectives or other

166
0:10:52.640 --> 0:10:58.480
small companies to have open source infrastructure on their own.

167
0:10:58.480 --> 0:11:02.040
And some of them are very...that we know.

168
0:11:02.040 --> 0:11:07.200
They also provide some training so that it's easier the migration from all these evil platforms

169
0:11:07.200 --> 0:11:09.240
to the new platforms that are using.

170
0:11:09.240 --> 0:11:11.280
We usually tend to...

171
0:11:11.280 --> 0:11:15.680
Lots of people who are technical know how we tend not to...

172
0:11:15.680 --> 0:11:22.400
We tend to underestimate how hard it is to change the routine from one platform to the

173
0:11:22.400 --> 0:11:23.480
other.

174
0:11:23.480 --> 0:11:27.760
And these setups, these collectives are great in doing that.

175
0:11:27.760 --> 0:11:28.760
Yep.

176
0:11:28.760 --> 0:11:34.280
And the solution number four and five are kind of very close together.

177
0:11:34.280 --> 0:11:40.480
But the solution number five is that recently there has been an increasing number of providers

178
0:11:40.480 --> 0:11:43.480
that focus on open source infrastructure.

179
0:11:43.480 --> 0:11:48.720
For example, there's a GitHub repository on Nextcloud called Providers.

180
0:11:48.720 --> 0:11:54.520
And these providers are not officially endorsed by Nextcloud, but they take care of setting

181
0:11:54.520 --> 0:11:57.840
up Nextcloud and maintaining it for you.

182
0:11:57.840 --> 0:11:58.840
And this is...

183
0:11:58.840 --> 0:12:00.400
Sorry, go back to...

184
0:12:00.400 --> 0:12:06.480
This is great because, for example, the Nextcloud ecosystem has also official partners of Nextcloud.

185
0:12:06.480 --> 0:12:09.600
So if you are a big organization, you just go there.

186
0:12:09.600 --> 0:12:13.160
If you're a small one, you just go to the list and research and do your own.

187
0:12:13.160 --> 0:12:16.000
Or you can do it yourself, as we mentioned before.

188
0:12:16.000 --> 0:12:21.960
Having all these options in a clear way makes it easier for people to just migrate for,

189
0:12:21.960 --> 0:12:27.520
I don't know, for my parents to start using Nextcloud for their photos on their Android

190
0:12:27.520 --> 0:12:28.520
phone.

191
0:12:28.520 --> 0:12:34.360
Which, by the way, I should update at some point because they asked them for me to help

192
0:12:34.360 --> 0:12:35.360
them.

193
0:12:35.360 --> 0:12:40.120
But it's important to keep in mind that it's not necessarily a one size fits all.

194
0:12:40.120 --> 0:12:45.000
And even if you find something that fits your need, your needs might change in the future.

195
0:12:45.000 --> 0:12:50.080
So it's important to think of these solutions as different alternatives and different steps

196
0:12:50.080 --> 0:12:55.000
that you can take on the journey to have open source infrastructure.

197
0:12:55.000 --> 0:13:01.080
So yeah, about managed service providers, as we mentioned, we think it should be very

198
0:13:01.080 --> 0:13:07.520
important to focus on platforms that are open source, so therefore open platforms.

199
0:13:07.520 --> 0:13:13.280
And with such service providers, usually you don't need to have technical knowledge to

200
0:13:13.280 --> 0:13:14.600
get things up and running.

201
0:13:14.600 --> 0:13:20.960
You need to have some knowledge, which is legal, but also from the provider that you

202
0:13:20.960 --> 0:13:26.520
are choosing, of where your data are, if it's compliant, and all these things.

203
0:13:26.520 --> 0:13:31.620
So you need some basic knowledge to understand what the other side is doing with all your

204
0:13:31.620 --> 0:13:34.080
infrastructure that you are managing, right?

205
0:13:34.080 --> 0:13:39.160
And these providers should also offer you with not just technical support when something

206
0:13:39.160 --> 0:13:44.960
is down, but we believe also with user support, because if you have an infrastructure, but

207
0:13:44.960 --> 0:13:48.320
nobody uses it, what's the point?

208
0:13:48.320 --> 0:13:52.800
And because managed service providers should not be the end goal, the end goal is to everybody

209
0:13:52.800 --> 0:13:54.800
to self host, right?

210
0:13:54.800 --> 0:14:00.160
But until then, we should be able to understand the terms of service to read them, because

211
0:14:00.160 --> 0:14:03.560
somebody else is doing the maintenance and they can do some.

212
0:14:03.560 --> 0:14:08.560
They might have higher expertise, but there are also mistakes that people do usually in

213
0:14:08.560 --> 0:14:10.160
these cases, right?

214
0:14:10.160 --> 0:14:14.520
And so in this case, terms of service are very important, not in this case always.

215
0:14:14.520 --> 0:14:18.720
And also to understand the legal coverage, as I mentioned before, where the servers are,

216
0:14:18.720 --> 0:14:20.560
where they deployed, et cetera, et cetera.

217
0:14:20.560 --> 0:14:25.000
And of course, very important, service continuity.

218
0:14:25.000 --> 0:14:31.840
There are many such service providers that provide open source platforms as managed service

219
0:14:31.840 --> 0:14:36.480
that they popped up, especially some years ago, pop up, they are there, and after like

220
0:14:36.480 --> 0:14:40.680
two years, they say, oh, it didn't work out for us, the pricing that we calculated was

221
0:14:40.680 --> 0:14:42.520
bad, and they shut down.

222
0:14:42.520 --> 0:14:50.080
So you also need to review your service provider if they seem to have a business continuity

223
0:14:50.080 --> 0:14:54.240
and a system to build the plan.

224
0:14:54.240 --> 0:14:58.000
So one example is, for example, Mastodon, right?

225
0:14:58.000 --> 0:15:01.000
There's a lot of talk about hosting Mastodon these days, et cetera.

226
0:15:01.000 --> 0:15:05.360
So you need to know where to deploy it and what you can do it again.

227
0:15:05.360 --> 0:15:07.760
You can do it yourself, but you can choose someone else to do it for you.

228
0:15:07.760 --> 0:15:13.080
You need to have technical know-how with all the platforms, platform-specific know-how.

229
0:15:13.080 --> 0:15:14.880
What does federation mean, for example?

230
0:15:14.880 --> 0:15:17.120
Or what's the truth?

231
0:15:17.120 --> 0:15:19.600
Legal implications and who does the moderation.

232
0:15:19.600 --> 0:15:25.320
All these things are very, very, very important for you to know.

233
0:15:25.320 --> 0:15:27.840
And five more seconds.

234
0:15:27.840 --> 0:15:34.240
So that's why, for example, for us, it took us months to understand and read a lot of

235
0:15:34.240 --> 0:15:42.680
legal paperwork and also research the platform before deciding to offer it to other people,

236
0:15:42.680 --> 0:15:45.080
which we are planning to do this week.

237
0:15:45.080 --> 0:15:49.840
And this is something that we are announcing just here today.

238
0:15:49.840 --> 0:15:51.840
Yeah.

239
0:15:51.840 --> 0:15:56.000
Something to keep in mind is that regardless of the option that you choose...

240
0:15:56.000 --> 0:15:57.000
Okay, go on.

241
0:15:57.000 --> 0:15:58.000
Very quick.

242
0:15:58.000 --> 0:15:59.120
Yeah, very quickly.

243
0:15:59.120 --> 0:16:04.840
Be careful to not be vendor-locked in, because that's a very important aspect.

244
0:16:04.840 --> 0:16:09.280
If you want the sticker, we have it around with us so you can get it later.

245
0:16:09.280 --> 0:16:10.280
Thank you so much.

246
0:16:10.280 --> 0:16:11.280
Thank you for your...

247
0:16:11.280 --> 0:16:29.800
Thank you very much.
