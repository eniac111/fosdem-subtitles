00:00.000 --> 00:26.760
Okay, the next speaker is Miquel Tameni, which has a talk about coffee or coffee osmo.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.560
It's an upper state map, it's received at a time.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.560
So check it and add shop on the map with the receipt.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.560
So the stage is yours.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.660
Hello everyone and thank you to be here.

00:43.660 --> 00:49.360
It's really nice to be here after attending like 10 additional post-em so it's my first talk.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.360
It's really great to be here.

00:51.360 --> 00:58.560
So I want to talk to you today about a little project that I started like five months ago, I think.

00:58.560 --> 01:05.360
And it basically wanted to be a new, different and hopefully easier way to add place,

01:05.360 --> 01:11.660
in particular business place to open a street map.

01:11.660 --> 01:19.460
And to give you a little bit of perspective, the usual process to insert a new place or

01:19.460 --> 01:26.360
a business into open street map usually involves with check if the place is already on open street map.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.760
So open the map and look for the location or where you want to add the place.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.560
Gather all the information needed.

01:33.560 --> 01:40.360
So the name, the position, the address, maybe the phone number, the website.

01:40.360 --> 01:48.260
Then open your preferred editor, the website or, you know, osmond or something like that.

01:48.260 --> 01:52.860
Insert all the information, check if it's correct and then save it.

01:52.860 --> 02:00.960
And it became easier over the time, but it's anyway a time-consuming task.

02:00.960 --> 02:08.260
And especially I found myself sometimes having problems on the updated information about a business,

02:08.260 --> 02:12.060
like the phone number or the website.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.460
Sometimes you find the incorrect information online.

02:15.460 --> 02:20.660
So I think it's quite hard sometimes to insert a new place.

02:20.660 --> 02:29.660
And so I got this idea that I'll tell you later how it's come.

02:29.660 --> 02:34.760
But to validate the idea, before coming to FOSNAM, we took a little bit longer way.

02:34.760 --> 02:41.860
We went to Zagreb with my friends to drink some beer for a sales purpose, obviously.

02:41.860 --> 02:50.860
And when you are in a new city that you don't know, you usually open them up

02:50.860 --> 03:00.060
and have a look where the majority of perhaps a restaurant or something like that, where they are.

03:00.060 --> 03:06.860
And when you see something like that, you know that on that street maybe it's a good place to be

03:06.860 --> 03:11.260
or on the other side of the city there is something else.

03:11.260 --> 03:16.360
But what you usually do is looking for restaurants, pubs, bars, etc.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.760
So it's quite important for me having this kind of information on the map.

03:20.760 --> 03:29.260
Open Street map, I think it's improved a lot over the last years, especially Europe maybe.

03:29.260 --> 03:33.760
But sometimes it's lacking the biggest information, I think.

03:33.760 --> 03:42.260
So we went to Zagreb, we tried to find as many bars as possible for this research.

03:42.260 --> 03:52.660
And what we found out is that there is so much more pubs and drinking place than what we spot on the map at first time.

03:52.660 --> 03:56.560
So our question is how we can improve this.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.660
Obviously, we can do more travel like this one.

04:00.660 --> 04:06.660
And instead of the information that we gather traveling,

04:06.660 --> 04:10.760
fortunately there is so many volunteers around the world that do this kind of stuff

04:10.760 --> 04:18.360
and insert all the kind of place that nowadays we can find on Open Street map.

04:18.360 --> 04:25.760
But as I told you before, it's a time consuming task and you have always to find the correct information

04:25.760 --> 04:29.760
about the business you want to add.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.360
So what we can do?

04:32.360 --> 04:40.960
We can do the things that they already said or do something like Bob does that is seated over there.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.060
I think he do a quite smart thing.

04:44.060 --> 04:51.360
He call it on the site that we get over our drinking nights.

04:51.360 --> 04:57.560
And after he check if the place where we went is already on the map or not.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.060
And it's not that it's in open street map.

05:01.060 --> 05:08.660
With all the information already there, no need to look everywhere because usually the receipt have the business name,

05:08.660 --> 05:12.460
the address, the location, the numbers, sometimes the website.

05:12.460 --> 05:18.060
So I think it's quite smart things to do something like this.

05:18.060 --> 05:23.060
Maybe it's not that smart that Bob usually do this after too many years.

05:23.060 --> 05:30.460
That's another problem and to avoid his mistakes like type or something like that.

05:30.460 --> 05:37.660
I think this could be interesting to try to automate the processor and the access information from the receipt.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.360
And basically the idea.

05:39.360 --> 05:46.260
So it's like to use not a picture of your receipt and you get all the information that you need to insert the place.

05:46.260 --> 05:51.660
And eventually you insert the place already if the place is not on open street map.

05:51.660 --> 05:57.060
So coffee or some basically do these things.

05:57.060 --> 05:59.260
Exeter the text from the receipt.

05:59.260 --> 06:03.660
Try to tokenize and label the data that you can find.

06:03.660 --> 06:09.860
Check if the existence of the place is the place is already on open street map.

06:09.860 --> 06:17.260
And if not, maybe we happen because it's not actually possible.

06:17.260 --> 06:24.760
You can insert it already on open street map or at least copy and paste all the information you need.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.960
And actually the project is quite small.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.460
It's just a proof of concept.

06:30.460 --> 06:35.860
And I thought a little bit about the architecture of this project.

06:35.860 --> 06:40.660
And maybe I started to try to do a standalone app.

06:40.660 --> 06:48.860
But I think that maybe it's better to have something that can be easily integrated in other application.

06:48.860 --> 06:58.960
There is something like street complete or other projects that do a great job to improve and make easy to be able to contribute to open street map.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.460
So I think it can be really, really interesting to maybe integrate a function like this in those apps.

07:05.460 --> 07:18.260
So I just mock it up a small Python API based on fast API that expose an endpoint where you can just upload an image.

07:18.260 --> 07:26.260
And then the software tried to understand what is on the site, label the data and just return it.

07:26.260 --> 07:40.460
Actually, the front end is just really, really small application that show as more form and visualize the information that the mechanic will extract.

07:40.460 --> 07:52.260
As I said, future integration for the editors, I think it will be the way to use this kind of function if it's probably to be interesting and useful and available.

07:52.260 --> 07:57.660
Or maybe it can be just a standalone app or a PVO. I actually don't know.

07:57.660 --> 08:03.260
It's something open and I'm here to discuss it actually.

08:03.260 --> 08:08.560
So how it works, actually, the receiver is allowed to a server.

08:08.560 --> 08:19.160
I removed the exit data just to have a little bit of privacy because can be there like the location, the time where you went in a place.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.060
And I think it's not something that you want to share.

08:23.060 --> 08:28.060
The image is a little bit pre-processed before the OCR.

08:28.060 --> 08:33.860
Actually, it's something really basic. I think it can be improved really a lot.

08:33.860 --> 08:48.060
And there is OCR with test out OCR that work quite good, but I think it can be a little bit better, maybe processing a little bit more an image before.

08:48.060 --> 08:59.760
Then I tried several ways to parse the data with Live Postal that actually I think is what I found the most available for this task with PASI.

08:59.760 --> 09:14.960
And maybe it could be interesting to train a custom model because I found some open source model that can understand what our receiver and invoice say.

09:14.960 --> 09:23.460
But it's usually trained about the product that you buy and find the price and the total and not the business name.

09:23.460 --> 09:27.360
So it doesn't work really well, actually.

09:27.360 --> 09:34.960
Then the beacon just look with nomination with the place already on the open street or not.

09:34.960 --> 09:41.560
If we can find the exact name, I try a location search with the WordPress API.

09:41.560 --> 09:56.460
So I look at the address, have a look at all the business of that type that is around and show a list to the user to just to make sure that the place is not there with a little bit different name.

09:56.460 --> 10:00.960
So what can be done different or better?

10:00.960 --> 10:04.360
I have in my to the list improved the text section.

10:04.360 --> 10:14.760
As I said before, the OCR actually works good. I tried the like the Google Vision API that worked much better, but I don't want to use it actually.

10:14.760 --> 10:25.860
So I think that maybe with a little bit more proper processing on the major, all the data started could be a little bit more accurate.

10:25.860 --> 10:32.060
As I said, the front end, actually, it's a really, really small application that just shows some information.

10:32.060 --> 10:36.360
It's maybe better to do on the client side all the stuff for privacy reasons.

10:36.360 --> 10:47.760
So I just can read the text, keep it on my device and just upload or save the new place to open street bumper and choosing what information I want to share.

10:47.760 --> 10:59.560
Integration. So as I said, use of the place directly from the app will be great or integrated with some other editor.

10:59.560 --> 11:15.960
More safe to test and improve because what we spot in the agrib, so our trip is not useful, actually, is that there is not a clear standard of obviously for a sieve and can change a little bit from place to place.

11:15.960 --> 11:24.460
In Italy, almost they are all the same. We didn't find this true for like the agrib.

11:24.460 --> 11:32.360
So maybe call it more information about how their sieve look all around the world could be great.

11:32.360 --> 11:40.160
What we can do, we don't know different because this is the step that I thought is the easiest.

11:40.160 --> 11:50.860
But maybe like I said, having a custom model that can label a little bit better information could be interesting,

11:50.860 --> 12:03.460
at least because sometimes you find not the name of the place on the receipt, but the name of the business that is sometimes different or sometimes you find both and actually post that they use, get confused.

12:03.460 --> 12:08.560
So you don't have a rebel over time.

12:08.560 --> 12:19.160
So why we don't use to find more pub, more beer, more fun, help Bob to drink some more good beer?

12:19.160 --> 12:30.760
And absolutely to improve open street maps together and just having an easier way to add place and so we can call it more information.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.960
So thank you. This is the website where you can find the source code.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.860
I asked the temporary playground where you can upload your sieve to test.

12:40.860 --> 12:46.060
And that's it. I just want to know if you find this idea interesting.

12:46.060 --> 12:50.260
If it could be good to go on with this project if you have some suggestions.

12:50.260 --> 12:55.960
So I asked question. It doesn't actually you to have questions.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.260
So thank you.

12:59.260 --> 13:08.860
Any?

13:17.260 --> 13:17.960
OK.

13:17.960 --> 13:23.960
the mic. Why don't you expect GPS coordinates from the X-ray?

13:23.960 --> 13:31.960
Because maybe you haven't snapped the photo when you just went out from the place, the

13:31.960 --> 13:37.800
first reason. And the second reason is for privacy, as I said before. But I think it

13:37.800 --> 13:43.240
will be great to offer the users the possible to choose if you want to share information.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.880
It's much easier because if you have the X-ray coordinates, you can just have a look in a

13:49.880 --> 13:55.960
really small area around and just easily found if the place is already on OpenState map or not.

13:55.960 --> 14:03.320
And even be more accurate when you insert it. So it's obviously a nice idea. I haven't done it

14:03.320 --> 14:11.000
just because sometimes, like Bob, he doesn't do the insert right away, but the day after the

14:11.000 --> 14:16.200
angle there, so like... Yep.

14:16.200 --> 14:23.400
Question, normally on the receipts, it always shows like the time when the receipt was printed or given to the customer.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.000
Can you repeat the question? Okay, I repeat the question.

14:27.000 --> 14:37.000
Could you somehow combine it? Maybe we scanned the pictures taken to think, maybe the picture was taken as the question or at the button or...

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
That's a nice idea. Yes, sir.
