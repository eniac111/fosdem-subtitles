WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.220
So, my name is Boris Baldassari.

00:08.220 --> 00:12.600
I work for the Eclipse Foundation as an open source consultant and I'd like to introduce

00:12.600 --> 00:18.880
the OSPO Alliance and the work we are doing on the Good Governance Initiative.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.440
So, to start with, what is an OSPO?

00:23.440 --> 00:30.680
OSPO stands for Open Source Program Office and it's a team within an organization that

00:30.680 --> 00:34.440
takes care of everything open source within the organization.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.640
So, it's supposed to be a single point of contact for any question people may have about

00:39.640 --> 00:42.480
open source licensing and so on.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.720
The OSPO is supposed to foster the awareness of open source within the organization, define

00:47.720 --> 00:55.400
and implement a strategy regarding open source for the organization, inbound, outbound and

00:55.400 --> 00:57.600
much more than that.

00:57.600 --> 01:06.840
So, the idea is to make sure that the organization make a good use of the open source they consume,

01:06.840 --> 01:09.600
produce and so on.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.800
It also includes things about the ecosystem, the open source ecosystem and the participation

01:14.800 --> 01:19.760
into the ecosystem, the open source ecosystem by the organization.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.160
It should be noted that it has many impacts on many domains, so it's from the legal to

01:26.160 --> 01:34.560
the technical to the security, dependencies, development practices and so on.

01:34.560 --> 01:42.800
It's a strong recent trend, so many organizations nowadays are in the process of setting up

01:42.800 --> 01:44.960
an OSPO.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.360
When I talk about organizations, I talk about any type of organization, so these could be

01:49.360 --> 01:56.980
corporations, SMEs, administrations, universities, NGOs and so on.

01:56.980 --> 02:02.760
The point with these organizations is that quite often they don't know anything about

02:02.760 --> 02:08.760
open source, it's not in their culture, so they just don't know where to start.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.560
That's where the OSPO Alliance comes into the picture.

02:13.560 --> 02:20.600
The OSPO Alliance was launched in 2021 by a group of four European nonprofit organizations

02:20.600 --> 02:26.200
and the idea is to promote an approach to excellence in open source software management.

02:26.200 --> 02:34.440
We wanted it to be really easy to access, low barrier, there is no fee, there is no

02:34.440 --> 02:39.760
fee, the only thing we ask is a letter of support, a statement of support from the organization

02:39.760 --> 02:43.480
to the principals of open source and the OSPO Alliance.

02:43.480 --> 02:50.280
All our activity is open, public and freely accessible, no need to register to get access

02:50.280 --> 02:53.780
to what we do our outcomes.

02:53.780 --> 02:59.960
We are entirely governed by open source principles, so you can just come, join us, collaborate

02:59.960 --> 03:07.480
and if you are an active contributor then you will become a mentor and so on.

03:07.480 --> 03:14.360
Once again it's for all types and sizes of organizations.

03:14.360 --> 03:23.880
Our mission is twofold, firstly help the organizations make sure that they better use the open source

03:23.880 --> 03:32.880
software and ecosystem and properly take care of open source and also make them good citizens

03:32.880 --> 03:35.320
of the open source ecosystem.

03:35.320 --> 03:41.960
Not only consuming and producing but also participating and financing and being there

03:41.960 --> 03:48.560
and openly asserting their use of open source, so things like that.

03:48.560 --> 03:57.040
To assure this goals we have set up different sub-task forces, the first and the most visible

03:57.040 --> 04:03.640
one is the Good Governance Initiative Handbook which is a blueprint to help organizations

04:03.640 --> 04:06.960
define and build their OSPO.

04:06.960 --> 04:13.320
We also provide a safe place to exchange information so people can ask any type of question when

04:13.320 --> 04:18.920
they are trying to replace some proprietary software by an open source alternative they

04:18.920 --> 04:22.880
can ask for what others did.

04:22.880 --> 04:29.600
We have mailing lists, meetings, regular meetings, we participate to events and we also have

04:29.600 --> 04:36.600
a monthly session which is called the OSPO UNRAMP sessions where some of our members

04:36.600 --> 04:45.320
present how they did with their OSPO and share their good practices, their mistakes too.

04:45.320 --> 04:54.320
And we also have a task force for evangelism and dissemination of our initiative.

04:54.320 --> 05:00.560
So the Good Governance Handbook as I said is a blueprint to help organizations define,

05:00.560 --> 05:08.960
so build a roadmap and actually build their OSPO and make it a success.

05:08.960 --> 05:15.080
For that we propose 25 activities which are good practices that you want to implement

05:15.080 --> 05:20.000
when you build your OSPO and when you want to grow the open source awareness within your

05:20.000 --> 05:22.040
organization.

05:22.040 --> 05:28.160
These 25 activities are organized into five goals which are kind of levels of maturity,

05:28.160 --> 05:35.200
so the first one will be identify the open source you use and identify the skills that

05:35.200 --> 05:43.280
you have, start changing your contracts with your employees so they can actually contribute,

05:43.280 --> 05:50.920
set up or educate the legal team, educate the executives, contribute back, contribute

05:50.920 --> 05:56.120
upstream, assert publicly your use of open source and so on.

05:56.120 --> 06:04.240
We also provide the methods to implement these 25 activities so we recommend an agile and

06:04.240 --> 06:11.120
agile-like process where you will pick a few activities, complete them, select a few other

06:11.120 --> 06:15.560
activities and so on until you have completed the scope.

06:15.560 --> 06:23.040
And we had quite some success, so the first edition of our end book was in 2021.

06:23.040 --> 06:30.200
Last year we did an update, the 1.1 version and we also have translations, so German and

06:30.200 --> 06:36.200
French are already available and a few others are on their way, so Portuguese, Spanish,

06:36.200 --> 06:41.720
Italian, and whatever your language is, please join us, we use Weblades and we of course

06:41.720 --> 06:45.160
welcome contributors.

06:45.160 --> 06:53.360
So talking about the activities, they have really a wide range and scope, so it's from,

06:53.360 --> 06:58.160
as I said, identifying the open source you use, doing software composition analysis,

06:58.160 --> 07:03.320
dependency management, vulnerability management, it's also about implementing the good practices

07:03.320 --> 07:09.480
that we use in open source, so setting up peer reviews and things like that.

07:09.480 --> 07:16.360
Understanding the people, each air, so the contract allowing people to contribute, funding

07:16.360 --> 07:21.760
the ecosystem, the project that you use, and the foundation and the organization that make

07:21.760 --> 07:25.880
the open source ecosystem.

07:25.880 --> 07:33.440
Up to executive education and potentially making open source strategic asset for your

07:33.440 --> 07:34.720
organization.

07:34.720 --> 07:41.040
Each activity has the same structure, so we have a description that states what this activity

07:41.040 --> 07:46.760
is about, opportunity assessments, why would you implement this activity, what it will

07:46.760 --> 07:53.880
bring to you, progress assessment so you know where you are and that enables to track your

07:53.880 --> 08:00.880
progress and know when you can say that it's a complete activity and you can switch to

08:00.880 --> 08:02.880
the next.

08:02.880 --> 08:09.120
So feedback from the field, experienced people saying well you might have a look at this

08:09.120 --> 08:16.480
that will help and also some tools and recommendations and resources that you might find useful.

08:16.480 --> 08:23.640
As I said, the good governance initiative is for any type of organizations, so there

08:23.640 --> 08:28.240
are activities that will not fit within your organization.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.300
The first thing that you will do actually when you will implement the handbook is look

08:32.300 --> 08:38.440
at all the activities and select the one that you want or reject the one that do not apply

08:38.440 --> 08:40.840
to your context, that's okay.

08:40.840 --> 08:46.160
And from there the activities are kind of generic, so what you want to do from there

08:46.160 --> 08:53.720
is for each activity create a scorecard which will be the local adaptation of the activity

08:53.720 --> 08:56.000
to your own organization.

08:56.000 --> 09:03.280
So that will imply stating the teams, the internal teams that you may reach out to,

09:03.280 --> 09:09.280
the competencies, skills that you may need, the processes, tools and resources that you

09:09.280 --> 09:15.440
can use and that you will have to deal with and also identify some specific tasks that

09:15.440 --> 09:22.240
are relevant to your context and that this task will help you track your progress on

09:22.240 --> 09:24.120
the scorecard.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.560
We provide the scorecards in two versions, one is the PDF that you can simply print and

09:28.560 --> 09:35.040
fill in with paper and pen, good old style, and also a digital one.

09:35.040 --> 09:41.880
So last year when we did the 1.1 version of the handbook, we introduced a new feature

09:41.880 --> 09:46.120
which is the deployable GGI program.

09:46.120 --> 09:54.920
So basically it's a GitLab project that you clone in your own GitLab or in any GitLab

09:54.920 --> 10:00.640
and from there there will be a bunch of scripts that will be executed, create 25 activities

10:00.640 --> 10:07.280
as GitLab issues, so create a board so you can visualize them, you can click on an issue

10:07.280 --> 10:11.440
and see the description, opportunity assessment and so on.

10:11.440 --> 10:20.880
From there you can edit the description to fill in your own scorecard and once you have

10:20.880 --> 10:25.280
that so you have all your issues, you can visualize them in the board, you have defined

10:25.280 --> 10:28.520
your scorecard, so you can just start working on them.

10:28.520 --> 10:34.560
So you select a few of them, you work on them, you complete them, you select a few other

10:34.560 --> 10:41.400
ones and so on and each and every time, so it's a nightly script actually, but the GGI

10:41.400 --> 10:49.000
will create a GitLab pages, a static website that will reflect where you are, what are

10:49.000 --> 10:58.600
your current activities, your past activities and will even provide a simple dashboard.

10:58.600 --> 11:06.920
So the list of activities when you have implemented the myGGI looks like that and the simple dashboard

11:06.920 --> 11:11.280
that you get in static website looks like that so you have the full description of the

11:11.280 --> 11:15.680
activities that you are working on and also the scorecard.

11:15.680 --> 11:23.960
So it really tracks your own adaptation and implementation of the GGI program.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.400
So that's all.

11:25.400 --> 11:34.560
Once again we are an open source initiative so you can access all our resources for free,

11:34.560 --> 11:40.040
not even need to register whatsoever, you go to our website ospo-alliance.org, from

11:40.040 --> 11:45.960
there you can download the Good Governance Handbook, there is an HTML version, you get

11:45.960 --> 11:52.160
access to all the translations that are available and there is also a section about contributing,

11:52.160 --> 11:59.680
you can just simply join our calls, we have weekly calls and you just connect, everything

11:59.680 --> 12:04.800
is there.

12:04.800 --> 12:11.800
So we are European based because our contributors are Europeans so it's really based on the

12:11.800 --> 12:17.320
European values and way of doing things and so on but we are open to absolutely everyone.

12:17.320 --> 12:23.680
So just come, join us, you can help on the translations, on the updates of the handbook,

12:23.680 --> 12:28.800
on the dissemination and if you want to follow us it's here.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.840
And that's it.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
Thank you.

12:30.840 --> 12:36.720
Thank you very much.
