WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Thank you. I'm Aurora from the University of Murcia.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.080
And I'm Michael from the University of Passau.

00:12.080 --> 00:16.320
And we will be presenting the NDSR 10-up Web Search.U projects.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.960
Two sister initiatives for a paradigm change in open search and discovery on the internet.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.700
We will have a common introduction and then each of us will delve into projects that we

00:27.700 --> 00:31.920
are involved in. And a short disclaimer before we start.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.440
In the last two days at Fosten we have heard a lot about personal lifetime projects.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.400
This is quite different because it's not personal.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.440
These are European institutions involved and it's not lifetime.

00:45.440 --> 00:51.080
But these projects they are just starting up and have nice ideas and require your attention

00:51.080 --> 00:56.360
and contribution. So NDSR 10-up Web Search is a European project

00:56.360 --> 01:03.320
that will welcome entrepreneurs, tech tapes, developers and socially engaged people that

01:03.320 --> 01:09.240
have challenging ideas about the way that we will search and discover information and

01:09.240 --> 01:17.960
data on the internet. So basically we will fund projects that are

01:17.960 --> 01:21.320
focusing on several topics that I will explain in a minute.

01:21.320 --> 01:28.360
And they are compliant with the European values of openness, transparency, privacy and trust.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.240
The applicants can be natural persons and organizations and they can apply individually

01:32.240 --> 01:37.680
or as a consortium of three members per team.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.360
Open Web Search is a project funded by the EU and has the goal of developing an open

01:43.360 --> 01:50.360
European infrastructure for a Web Search. There are several research and computing centers

01:50.360 --> 01:56.920
involved and the project started in September last year and has a timeframe of three years.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.220
It's quite interesting that it's the first project which is funded by the EU and has

02:02.220 --> 02:08.160
the goal of developing Europe's own Web Index. And for those who don't know, a Web Index

02:08.160 --> 02:13.040
is a data structure which allows the vast access of Web Data.

02:13.040 --> 02:20.240
It is the fundamental core of all current search engines.

02:20.240 --> 02:31.280
And it enables the development of all kind of Web Search and Web Data retrieval services.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.360
So for us, let me present you the project partners. We are Link Novane, Aarhus University,

02:36.360 --> 02:43.480
the University of Murcia, OWU2 and Family Box. These are some of our faces.

02:43.480 --> 02:47.720
We will organize five different open calls and we welcome these innovative projects.

02:47.720 --> 02:53.080
We will provide them financial support up to â‚¬150,000.

02:53.080 --> 02:58.280
As well, we will not only provide financial but also technical business and innovation

02:58.280 --> 03:03.160
support and the projects are expected to take 12 months.

03:03.160 --> 03:12.040
The first open call, which is already closed, the evaluation is ongoing and it was a technological-based

03:12.040 --> 03:19.160
call, meaning that we were looking for products, finalized products.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.400
And then we will select 9 to 10 projects in the topics that you see on the screen, based

03:24.400 --> 03:30.600
voice assistants, NLP, semantic analysis, social computing and data visualization.

03:30.600 --> 03:36.640
But let me delve a little bit more on the second open call topics which may cut your

03:36.640 --> 03:39.800
attention. I hope you can resonate with some of them.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.240
The second open call will open in April, 1 April.

03:44.240 --> 03:50.240
It's a little bit more research-oriented but please have a look because we have plenty

03:50.240 --> 03:52.760
of space for everything.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.120
And let me explain each topic. The first one is power cognitive search by reinforcement

03:57.120 --> 04:02.200
learning. Basically, we look for mechanisms of self-learning

04:02.200 --> 04:07.280
and all kinds of algorithms that can contribute to a reinforcement learning system that is

04:07.280 --> 04:13.960
able to learn with the interactions how to choose the right data and algorithms in order

04:13.960 --> 04:19.600
to make any search more relevant towards the objective of it.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.360
Then the second topic is machine-based data, Internet of Things data.

04:23.360 --> 04:29.240
Basically we look for algorithms for search and pattern discovery that are adapted or

04:29.240 --> 04:38.680
that can adapt to IoT characteristics which means we will look for edge computing, algorithms

04:38.680 --> 04:45.120
that can deal with time series, with events, with different geo-localizations and so on.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.280
We have also AI-based taxonomies. We look for the automatic creation and expansion of

04:50.280 --> 04:57.640
existing taxonomies that are machine-based, machine interpretable semantics by using AI

04:57.640 --> 05:01.760
techniques. Basically, we want to model the interdependency

05:01.760 --> 05:08.200
among new concepts so we want to adapt to the dynamic and the dynamicity of the data.

05:08.200 --> 05:14.840
The next topic is network analysis. Basically, we want to find other ways to create knowledge

05:14.840 --> 05:21.520
graphs which are an interlinked network of distributed resources that can be searched.

05:21.520 --> 05:27.400
We can do this looking for the objective can be to make them more scalable, to test the

05:27.400 --> 05:35.080
quality of the creative models, to create different semantics, to make them compliant

05:35.080 --> 05:39.160
with diversity and dynamicity of data and so on.

05:39.160 --> 05:47.440
Then we have AI-based search tools and content generators. As you know, nowadays AI-based

05:47.440 --> 05:53.000
content generators are quite popular. Here I have some names that have been coming up

05:53.000 --> 06:01.600
in FOSM many times, CheckTPT, GitHub Copilot, CopyAI. We welcome projects that can help

06:01.600 --> 06:06.600
evaluate the privacy of these kind of tools. Also, look for research and technological

06:06.600 --> 06:11.520
gaps on them as well as the completeness of their answers.

06:11.520 --> 06:16.840
Then we have the topic of ethics in search and discovery. We want to have projects that

06:16.840 --> 06:24.320
specifically focus on testing that the developments of search and discovery are compliant with

06:24.320 --> 06:32.400
human rights, that they are not biased towards minorities, towards gender, so that they promote

06:32.400 --> 06:44.280
equality but also private and they take care of the confidentiality.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.440
Finally we have new ways of discovering and accessing information which can be a broad

06:48.440 --> 06:53.320
topic so that we don't leave anything behind. How are we going to do that? We are going

06:53.320 --> 06:59.040
to provide technology mentoring and advice on technologies to access store managed data

06:59.040 --> 07:04.840
and also on algorithms and platforms that are tailored to the projects. We are going

07:04.840 --> 07:11.300
to leverage the ReachOut beta testing platform for beta testing campaigns. Then we are going

07:11.300 --> 07:14.600
to link the projects to different standards and promote the conversations with different

07:14.600 --> 07:21.260
foundations that will be related to them. We will have a program for market readiness.

07:21.260 --> 07:31.360
We will create workshops for pitch training so that they can try to pitch their solution

07:31.360 --> 07:37.680
or their project to potential investors and users. Business modeling, advice and coaching.

07:37.680 --> 07:44.280
As for innovation, we will give information about which kind of open source license they

07:44.280 --> 07:50.720
can have, they can use, how to manage it and how to make their research and their solutions

07:50.720 --> 07:58.440
reproducible, so following open science principles. So as to conclude from my part, the next three

07:58.440 --> 08:04.160
years there will be five open calls that will challenge the way that we search and discover

08:04.160 --> 08:12.560
information on the internet. We have synergies with the NDI mission of looking for a more

08:12.560 --> 08:17.600
human centric internet. These are our core values, open source, contributions to the

08:17.600 --> 08:23.560
wider community, collaboration and open science principles as well as transfer challenges

08:23.560 --> 08:30.600
that include sustainability and equality. I give the floor to my colleague.

08:30.600 --> 08:38.480
So now switching to the second system project, Open Web Search. As I said before, there are

08:38.480 --> 08:45.680
several computing and research centers involved in the project and it's good this way because

08:45.680 --> 08:52.080
all of these have different competences like universities or businesses and this underlines

08:52.080 --> 08:59.660
one specific point about the project. In a contrary to the web index which is operated

08:59.660 --> 09:04.760
by Google for example, this project does not follow a centralized approach but it tries

09:04.760 --> 09:14.640
to build up a web index collaboratively and distributed among several European institutions.

09:14.640 --> 09:24.600
Otherwise, it would just not be possible to build up a web index from scratch. I will

09:24.600 --> 09:29.640
keep the motivation short because it should be clear why it is a good idea to have own

09:29.640 --> 09:36.160
a web index in Europe. The first thing is the imbalance in the search engine market.

09:36.160 --> 09:46.680
There are four big global web indexes out there from big tech companies and this dominance

09:46.680 --> 09:53.240
of these companies has a lot of negative effects on the critical infrastructure web search

09:53.240 --> 10:02.960
so to say. The solution is to strive for more plurality. Another thing is that web data

10:02.960 --> 10:10.280
is a driver for innovations. An example, just one out of many examples that has drawn a

10:10.280 --> 10:19.680
lot of attention lately is the training of large language models such as JetGPT which

10:19.680 --> 10:31.360
works on its basis with web data. The project goals are developing the core of an open web

10:31.360 --> 10:42.080
index so two remarks on this point. This will be done with open source and open configuration

10:42.080 --> 10:47.040
and it is not expected that at the end of the three years of the project there will

10:47.040 --> 10:56.360
be a production ready index. But the goal is to have an index which contains at least

10:56.360 --> 11:04.320
50% of all text web pages and then that can be worked on and that shows as a prototype

11:04.320 --> 11:12.760
that it is possible to create it collaboratively and distribute it among several institutions.

11:12.760 --> 11:18.720
Another goal is to build an ecosystem around the index and make it publicly available in

11:18.720 --> 11:24.960
this way. As I said before, it serves as a feasibility study in some way to show that

11:24.960 --> 11:31.640
it is possible to do it collaboratively and that is why along the way it should be established

11:31.640 --> 11:41.760
a network among European infrastructure partners. The overall vision of the project is to give

11:41.760 --> 11:51.240
open access for innovators and businesses and researchers on web data to enable them

11:51.240 --> 11:58.920
to build new business ideas for example or to work on their ideas on web search and web

11:58.920 --> 12:10.520
analysis. As for the NGI search project, there are also ways to contribute to openwebsearch.eu

12:10.520 --> 12:17.120
through third party calls. There will be three public calls with a fixed amount of funding

12:17.120 --> 12:23.680
and the first of them focuses on the legal aspects of the project. There are two tracks.

12:23.680 --> 12:31.680
The first one focuses contributions on legal and business and social aspects of web search

12:31.680 --> 12:37.920
in general and the second track focuses on the legal compliance of the crawling so the

12:37.920 --> 12:44.800
acquisition of the data from the internet which is then stored in the index. This call

12:44.800 --> 12:54.280
will open on the first of March this year. There are also other opportunities to contribute

12:54.280 --> 13:02.160
which is covered by the upcoming calls and this course overview of the architecture should

13:02.160 --> 13:10.800
just give you a hint on where these contributions can be located. If you have an idea on how

13:10.800 --> 13:20.400
to develop a search and discovery application, this can be done for example as a vertical

13:20.400 --> 13:32.000
search engine on top of the web index infrastructure or it can be a content analysis method which

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
enriches the data which is then stored in the index. As a conclusion, the openwebsearch.eu

13:42.000 --> 13:52.000
project wants to open up web search and strides for more plurality to give new business ideas

13:52.000 --> 14:00.400
a chance and new alternative search engines a chance. Therefore, the project partners

14:00.400 --> 14:09.680
collaborate and build up a European open web index which is then publicly available. For

14:09.680 --> 14:15.660
researchers, innovators and businesses there is the possibility to contribute either by

14:15.660 --> 14:24.280
developing your own business model which sets upon the open web index or by involving in

14:24.280 --> 14:30.320
one of the three public calls. The first one of them, as I said, opens on the first of

14:30.320 --> 14:55.320
March. So thanks for your attention and we're open for questions.
