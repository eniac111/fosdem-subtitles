0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.260
Hello, good morning everyone.

2
0:00:09.260 --> 0:00:12.800
I'm Christopher Peters and I'm going to present you Grotto Center.

3
0:00:12.800 --> 0:00:15.220
So first a bit about me.

4
0:00:15.220 --> 0:00:16.800
I'm from Belgium.

5
0:00:16.800 --> 0:00:21.960
I'm mostly working as a trainer and consultant in open source and DevOps.

6
0:00:21.960 --> 0:00:27.000
And in my free time, I'm spending quite a lot of time doing outdoor adventure stuff

7
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:29.680
such as, for example, I go into caves.

8
0:00:29.680 --> 0:00:32.880
By the way, for the people who like to enjoy the pictures of my slides, this is the only

9
0:00:32.880 --> 0:00:34.880
picture that I didn't take.

10
0:00:34.880 --> 0:00:39.700
So it's a bit difficult to take it when you're posing for it.

11
0:00:39.700 --> 0:00:42.680
So first a bit about caving or spalliology.

12
0:00:42.680 --> 0:00:44.920
So what does it actually mean?

13
0:00:44.920 --> 0:00:51.440
It's mostly a scientific study where we are going into caves or outdoors and explore cast

14
0:00:51.440 --> 0:00:55.720
phenomena or caves in particular.

15
0:00:55.720 --> 0:01:00.600
If we are going into caves to study what is happening over there, there are different

16
0:01:00.600 --> 0:01:01.600
sciences that are involved.

17
0:01:01.600 --> 0:01:08.120
There is geology, there is biology, there is also a lot of physics and chemistry involved.

18
0:01:08.120 --> 0:01:14.560
But in general, to get to the place that we want to study, we need to go and pass certain

19
0:01:14.560 --> 0:01:15.560
obstacles.

20
0:01:15.560 --> 0:01:18.680
We have to crawl through some small passages.

21
0:01:18.680 --> 0:01:21.320
We have to descend into pits.

22
0:01:21.320 --> 0:01:25.280
And for that we need a certain physical activity to get there.

23
0:01:25.280 --> 0:01:30.760
So there are some people who do this for science, to actually research things that are happening

24
0:01:30.760 --> 0:01:31.760
down there.

25
0:01:31.760 --> 0:01:34.960
There are other people who just like to do the physical activity.

26
0:01:34.960 --> 0:01:37.680
And so it's also a bit of a sport.

27
0:01:37.680 --> 0:01:43.360
For the people who are a bit familiar with other terminologies, in English it's also

28
0:01:43.360 --> 0:01:45.880
known as caving, potholing, spallunking.

29
0:01:45.880 --> 0:01:46.920
So they're different words for it.

30
0:01:46.920 --> 0:01:50.760
But in general, the idea is we go into caves.

31
0:01:50.760 --> 0:01:56.320
Now if we go into caves, of course there are a few things that we have to keep in mind.

32
0:01:56.320 --> 0:02:00.120
And one of the things that I would like to present to you today is a problem that we

33
0:02:00.120 --> 0:02:02.800
often have to deal with.

34
0:02:02.800 --> 0:02:06.680
So when we go into caves, on this picture you can see a person who is descending into

35
0:02:06.680 --> 0:02:08.440
a pit on a rope.

36
0:02:08.440 --> 0:02:13.720
And this is something you don't do just like, okay, you know, it's 10 o'clock, let's go

37
0:02:13.720 --> 0:02:17.200
and see what's in this hole.

38
0:02:17.200 --> 0:02:19.240
We actually do some preparations.

39
0:02:19.240 --> 0:02:25.600
For that we are using a lot of information that we are consulting to make sure that we

40
0:02:25.600 --> 0:02:27.600
have the adequate equipment with us.

41
0:02:27.600 --> 0:02:35.520
We have also made sure that we are using the right tools that we are also making sure that

42
0:02:35.520 --> 0:02:37.240
we're not going in the wrong moments.

43
0:02:37.240 --> 0:02:43.360
Because sometimes also weather conditions can make a very bad influence on the conditions

44
0:02:43.360 --> 0:02:44.360
in a cave.

45
0:02:44.360 --> 0:02:50.960
Here you see an example of a survey, we have quite a lot of surveys that provide us with

46
0:02:50.960 --> 0:02:54.440
information on how the cave looks like, if it has already been explored.

47
0:02:54.440 --> 0:03:00.280
And we can use these surveys to also make sure that we have all the rigging material

48
0:03:00.280 --> 0:03:06.720
with us, that we make sure that we know where we are going, what we are going to do, and

49
0:03:06.720 --> 0:03:13.400
what kind of dangers that could be involved in this trip.

50
0:03:13.400 --> 0:03:18.600
For this we have the surveys, they provide us with this information, there is also sometimes

51
0:03:18.600 --> 0:03:23.320
a description that is added to the survey which provides us more information of, for

52
0:03:23.320 --> 0:03:28.400
example, how to get to the entrance, maybe some particularities, special things we would

53
0:03:28.400 --> 0:03:32.240
like to see or special things we would like to avoid.

54
0:03:32.240 --> 0:03:36.720
And sometimes also separately we have rigging information.

55
0:03:36.720 --> 0:03:41.520
That's not always the case, but depending on how well a cave has been researched and

56
0:03:41.520 --> 0:03:45.240
explored, these documents are available.

57
0:03:45.240 --> 0:03:52.560
On this survey there is also, over here you can see that there is an indication which

58
0:03:52.560 --> 0:03:57.440
actually also tells that this is a pit of 20 meters, and so sometimes also this information

59
0:03:57.440 --> 0:04:00.560
is only available on the survey.

60
0:04:00.560 --> 0:04:06.280
Except for that we also have other information which is not very necessary to just facilitate

61
0:04:06.280 --> 0:04:09.840
the trip itself, but which can give us some more background.

62
0:04:09.840 --> 0:04:16.280
For example, scientific research that has been performed, some information about the

63
0:04:16.280 --> 0:04:22.520
region that could be geologically, that could be biologically, that could also be, for example,

64
0:04:22.520 --> 0:04:26.880
information about how rivers are flowing above and underground.

65
0:04:26.880 --> 0:04:33.140
There is also other kind of research that can have been performed that isn't necessarily

66
0:04:33.140 --> 0:04:38.520
limited to this specific cave we are going to visit, but that could be more broad and

67
0:04:38.520 --> 0:04:44.600
give more information about also the region or maybe a particular kind of cave.

68
0:04:44.600 --> 0:04:49.120
And other documentation, like for example, when they made this survey they also took

69
0:04:49.120 --> 0:04:50.120
measurements.

70
0:04:50.120 --> 0:04:56.720
This survey has been made probably with compass and just measuring tape, and thus they might

71
0:04:56.720 --> 0:04:58.320
have taken notes of that.

72
0:04:58.320 --> 0:05:01.600
They might have also saved them somewhere.

73
0:05:01.600 --> 0:05:08.360
These days we are also using more modern technologies such as radar and 3D scanners, and also those

74
0:05:08.360 --> 0:05:12.840
data points that can be saved and they can also be archived.

75
0:05:12.840 --> 0:05:18.320
All this kind of information is available at a certain location most of the time.

76
0:05:18.320 --> 0:05:23.520
It is the person who has actually, who has generated this information, who owns this

77
0:05:23.520 --> 0:05:24.520
information.

78
0:05:24.520 --> 0:05:31.080
But if we want to share this, we are very much scattered around the world and there

79
0:05:31.080 --> 0:05:34.280
is not such a thing as a central database.

80
0:05:34.280 --> 0:05:37.440
That is the actual problem we have to deal with.

81
0:05:37.440 --> 0:05:42.440
So if you look at how we are going to share this information these days, a lot of this

82
0:05:42.440 --> 0:05:49.760
happens by email or by websites or blogs, sometimes also some file transfer services.

83
0:05:49.760 --> 0:05:56.100
But in general all the information is at one specific organization, one specific person

84
0:05:56.100 --> 0:06:00.780
or group of persons, and you have to know where you have to go to if you want to actually

85
0:06:00.780 --> 0:06:02.760
access the information.

86
0:06:02.760 --> 0:06:08.080
There are some countries who do have their central databases, but this is not something

87
0:06:08.080 --> 0:06:12.440
which is also standardized or generalized.

88
0:06:12.440 --> 0:06:17.100
If we then have the information about the cave, like for example the survey, how also

89
0:06:17.100 --> 0:06:20.560
are we going to link this with scientific research that has been performed around this

90
0:06:20.560 --> 0:06:21.640
cave?

91
0:06:21.640 --> 0:06:24.060
That is also one of the problems we have to deal with.

92
0:06:24.060 --> 0:06:29.360
If we are contacting someone because we want to visit the cave, very often we get a survey

93
0:06:29.360 --> 0:06:34.160
or we get a description or we get a combination of both, but we don't get all the information

94
0:06:34.160 --> 0:06:35.320
that is available.

95
0:06:35.320 --> 0:06:42.220
Also because very often this information is not centralized in one sort of group of people.

96
0:06:42.220 --> 0:06:48.100
Some people have one part of the information, other people have another part of the information.

97
0:06:48.100 --> 0:06:53.680
And then when I contact someone to obtain this information and if I have been using

98
0:06:53.680 --> 0:06:58.640
it for a while and then afterwards an update has been provided on this information, how

99
0:06:58.640 --> 0:07:02.800
am I going to make sure that I'm also getting this update?

100
0:07:02.800 --> 0:07:08.200
Because also in this world science is still moving on, we are still exploring new places

101
0:07:08.200 --> 0:07:15.080
underground, we're still finding new places, new caves, and so all these kinds of information

102
0:07:15.080 --> 0:07:21.320
need to be shared as well because the survey that I was showing before is a very old one.

103
0:07:21.320 --> 0:07:24.440
There are already several newer versions of that available right now.

104
0:07:24.440 --> 0:07:29.400
And so if I get this survey one day and a newer version is made the other day, how am

105
0:07:29.400 --> 0:07:34.440
I going to make sure that I also get this if the person who sent me the first one is

106
0:07:34.440 --> 0:07:38.440
forgetting to also send me updates?

107
0:07:38.440 --> 0:07:43.280
For that there is a solution and this solution is Grotto Center.

108
0:07:43.280 --> 0:07:44.660
So what is Grotto Center?

109
0:07:44.660 --> 0:07:50.720
It is a sort of wiki database which is made for cavers and also mostly made by cavers.

110
0:07:50.720 --> 0:07:58.040
So there are a few people in France, they have been starting developing a database which

111
0:07:58.040 --> 0:08:02.840
they use to store all the information and it is made public available so that everyone

112
0:08:02.840 --> 0:08:04.480
can use it.

113
0:08:04.480 --> 0:08:12.540
It is supported by the European Caving Federation and it is also supported by the International

114
0:08:12.540 --> 0:08:17.800
Caving Federation who also officially hosts some parts of this.

115
0:08:17.800 --> 0:08:22.400
The idea is to have a global source of all kinds of information about caves and caste

116
0:08:22.400 --> 0:08:28.000
phenomena and to have it with an open access so that everyone can access this information.

117
0:08:28.000 --> 0:08:32.600
Also with the idea to use standards so that all the information is saved in the same way

118
0:08:32.600 --> 0:08:38.600
and it is very easy for everyone to also add information and also query this.

119
0:08:38.600 --> 0:08:44.600
And because we are using standards we are also making it very easy to make it accessible

120
0:08:44.600 --> 0:08:50.960
by machines as well so that you can query this using APIs.

121
0:08:50.960 --> 0:08:58.960
How are we going to then use these kind of standards to make sure that everyone can access

122
0:08:58.960 --> 0:08:59.960
this information?

123
0:08:59.960 --> 0:09:05.200
For this we made a standard which is called Cast Link and which enables us to link all

124
0:09:05.200 --> 0:09:07.480
the different documents to caves.

125
0:09:07.480 --> 0:09:13.800
For this we didn't really try to reinvent the wheel, we just extended a tool which is

126
0:09:13.800 --> 0:09:18.120
from the W3C Linked Data and Semantic Web.

127
0:09:18.120 --> 0:09:24.280
This enables us to store the information in such a way that it is very easy to access

128
0:09:24.280 --> 0:09:30.800
also using machine readable sort of ways such as APIs.

129
0:09:30.800 --> 0:09:32.720
And then you have Grotto Center itself.

130
0:09:32.720 --> 0:09:39.260
So here you see the front page of the website where you have on the side menu bar which

131
0:09:39.260 --> 0:09:42.600
you can easily use to browse the information.

132
0:09:42.600 --> 0:09:46.520
If we then go, you can see there is a quick search and advanced search.

133
0:09:46.520 --> 0:09:48.240
I'm going to skip those for a moment.

134
0:09:48.240 --> 0:09:54.120
I'm going to skip to the map and then here you see a screenshot of a part of Belgium

135
0:09:54.120 --> 0:09:59.040
where you can also see all the hexagons which are indicating where are caves or cluster

136
0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:00.160
of caves.

137
0:10:00.160 --> 0:10:03.640
So these are just sort of caves bundled together.

138
0:10:03.640 --> 0:10:09.080
If you further zoom in then you can actually see over here you can see that there are also

139
0:10:09.080 --> 0:10:14.720
a switch point where you can find certain caves and then you also have over there the

140
0:10:14.720 --> 0:10:19.200
pop-up which appears when you click on one of those points which provides us with some

141
0:10:19.200 --> 0:10:24.080
information like for example here which cave has been found at that location and then also

142
0:10:24.080 --> 0:10:27.140
a link to the data sheet of this cave.

143
0:10:27.140 --> 0:10:29.680
So this is the data sheet of that exact cave.

144
0:10:29.680 --> 0:10:32.060
You can see then where it is on the map.

145
0:10:32.060 --> 0:10:37.320
You can get some basic information such as for example the exact GPS coordinates, some

146
0:10:37.320 --> 0:10:41.680
information about how deep and how long the cave is when it's been discovered and then

147
0:10:41.680 --> 0:10:46.200
if you browse down here you can also find some information about for example the location.

148
0:10:46.200 --> 0:10:51.200
If you go down a bit more in the description you can also find documents such as the cave

149
0:10:51.200 --> 0:10:53.360
survey.

150
0:10:53.360 --> 0:10:56.160
Not all this information is of course very extended.

151
0:10:56.160 --> 0:10:59.500
It depends very much on the people who add this information.

152
0:10:59.500 --> 0:11:08.420
So this is one that has been created automatically using an import which is done during migration

153
0:11:08.420 --> 0:11:12.720
of Grotto Center from version 2 to version 3.

154
0:11:12.720 --> 0:11:17.640
But most of this information is being provided by users.

155
0:11:17.640 --> 0:11:19.240
It's just like Wikipedia.

156
0:11:19.240 --> 0:11:23.880
If I don't write a webpage, a Wikipedia page about Grotto Center then there is no Wikipedia

157
0:11:23.880 --> 0:11:26.860
page available about Grotto Center.

158
0:11:26.860 --> 0:11:30.920
So this is information that can be shared by everyone.

159
0:11:30.920 --> 0:11:36.360
On the top there is also a login which enables you to add to your information yourselves.

160
0:11:36.360 --> 0:11:39.240
How are we making this possible?

161
0:11:39.240 --> 0:11:42.000
We are using different technologies.

162
0:11:42.000 --> 0:11:48.200
The complete infrastructure is running on AWS and Microsoft Azure and we're using Docker

163
0:11:48.200 --> 0:11:50.400
to also host our application.

164
0:11:50.400 --> 0:11:55.500
For the rest we're using quite a lot of JavaScript so there is a node involved, there is Sales

165
0:11:55.500 --> 0:11:57.720
JS, React.

166
0:11:57.720 --> 0:12:05.240
We are also using GitHub to host our code so you can also browse the code freely because

167
0:12:05.240 --> 0:12:11.560
this is of course an open source project so the GitHub project is freely available.

168
0:12:11.560 --> 0:12:14.080
You can check out the code over there.

169
0:12:14.080 --> 0:12:18.640
For the rest you can also get in touch using our Slack channel.

170
0:12:18.640 --> 0:12:23.640
There is a wiki which explains how you can use this tool if you want to add information

171
0:12:23.640 --> 0:12:26.720
and then for the rest a few other links.

172
0:12:26.720 --> 0:12:29.680
For example here you have the WikiCaves Foundation.

173
0:12:29.680 --> 0:12:36.120
The WikiCaves Foundation is the foundation which is responsible for the project so Grotto

174
0:12:36.120 --> 0:12:41.080
Center is being officially organized by WikiCaves.

175
0:12:41.080 --> 0:12:49.040
They are also making sure that all the funding and all the partners are being addressed.

176
0:12:49.040 --> 0:12:56.440
Then a link to what is called the Documentation Center of the International Caving Federation

177
0:12:56.440 --> 0:12:59.680
where you can find all the scientific documents.

178
0:12:59.680 --> 0:13:04.160
They have been imported into Grotto Center so these days if you are browsing information

179
0:13:04.160 --> 0:13:10.580
about specific caves then you can also find all the scientific bulletins linked to specific

180
0:13:10.580 --> 0:13:12.160
caves.

181
0:13:12.160 --> 0:13:17.800
Last link is one to the CastLink project page where you can find more information as well

182
0:13:17.800 --> 0:13:22.800
as the current standard.

183
0:13:22.800 --> 0:13:29.280
We are building this mostly with people who are doing spelology and who are by accident

184
0:13:29.280 --> 0:13:32.400
also IT people.

185
0:13:32.400 --> 0:13:38.300
We are also very grateful that we from time to time get some interns from different schools

186
0:13:38.300 --> 0:13:46.920
that want to build on specific parts of our project to make it better and to also add

187
0:13:46.920 --> 0:13:48.400
more functionality.

188
0:13:48.400 --> 0:13:54.240
For that we can rely on interns from the Polytech of Montpellier as well as the Epitech from

189
0:13:54.240 --> 0:13:58.480
Montpellier and the University of Grenoble.

190
0:13:58.480 --> 0:14:01.480
Many thanks to them as well.

191
0:14:01.480 --> 0:14:05.920
Some of our partners, I didn't list all of them because then my slide would be very full

192
0:14:05.920 --> 0:14:13.060
but there are quite a lot of clubs and caving associations, federations who are sponsoring

193
0:14:13.060 --> 0:14:17.520
the project and who are making it possible that we can build this and we can host this

194
0:14:17.520 --> 0:14:24.640
on an infrastructure that is also made it, that makes it possible that everyone can access

195
0:14:24.640 --> 0:14:26.600
this.

196
0:14:26.600 --> 0:14:29.480
So here by I would like to conclude my presentation.

197
0:14:29.480 --> 0:14:35.480
If there are any questions then I'm very eager to answer them and if you have any questions

198
0:14:35.480 --> 0:14:40.320
later you can also reach out to us on our Slack or GitHub or project pages.

199
0:14:40.320 --> 0:14:47.320
Thank you very much.
