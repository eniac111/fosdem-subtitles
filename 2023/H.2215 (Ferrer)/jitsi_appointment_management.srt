0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.640
Hello, I'm Konstantinos Pabadimitriou.

2
0:00:09.640 --> 0:00:16.880
I'm the web developer and analyst from GeForce Open Technology Salients.

3
0:00:16.880 --> 0:00:26.240
I will show you how we combine these appointments with JITC for online appointment management.

4
0:00:26.240 --> 0:00:33.880
In COVID, a lot of private and public services switched to online appointments.

5
0:00:33.880 --> 0:00:44.120
Most of them used closed source services for the online part.

6
0:00:44.120 --> 0:00:52.760
We at GeForce adapted the easy appointments, which is an online software platform for appointment

7
0:00:52.760 --> 0:00:55.400
management in JITC.

8
0:00:55.400 --> 0:01:07.280
An online open source meeting with audio and video, and combined them into a seamless integration

9
0:01:07.280 --> 0:01:17.600
for booking an appointment that will take place online rather than physically.

10
0:01:17.600 --> 0:01:23.880
About our organization, we established in 2008, we are a non-profit organization, and

11
0:01:23.880 --> 0:01:33.240
also we have shareholders, universities, research centers, and public beneficial organizations.

12
0:01:33.240 --> 0:01:40.120
Our objectives are development and promotion of open standards, open software, open content,

13
0:01:40.120 --> 0:01:48.600
open data, open government, open educational resources, creative common license of open

14
0:01:48.600 --> 0:01:55.480
material and design technologies, and also open hardware and design.

15
0:01:55.480 --> 0:02:02.480
We contribute to openness in education, in public sector, and also in private sector.

16
0:02:02.480 --> 0:02:08.560
We have thematic working groups on open software and open standards, open technologies and

17
0:02:08.560 --> 0:02:17.240
education, open governance and open data, open design, open hardware, wireless networks,

18
0:02:17.240 --> 0:02:24.320
information, system security, and personal data protection, and also innovation and entrepreneurship.

19
0:02:24.320 --> 0:02:33.960
Well, the easy appointments part, it's a web application for appointment management.

20
0:02:33.960 --> 0:02:43.040
It has a very easy installation on a web server, and also configuration is simple.

21
0:02:43.040 --> 0:02:50.240
Workers can use it directly without having to install any applications.

22
0:02:50.240 --> 0:02:58.800
The operation is using a web browser, and it works on a computer, on tablet, or mobile

23
0:02:58.800 --> 0:03:04.560
phones since the design is responsive.

24
0:03:04.560 --> 0:03:11.280
It's a really simple and fast operation, optimized without unnecessary options.

25
0:03:11.280 --> 0:03:17.320
Also easy to use environment for managing the appointments from the service side.

26
0:03:17.320 --> 0:03:24.120
It supports over 25 languages, and also since it's open source, anyone can contribute more

27
0:03:24.120 --> 0:03:25.560
languages.

28
0:03:25.560 --> 0:03:34.440
It's written by Greek developer Alex Chelegidis, which actively continues development.

29
0:03:34.440 --> 0:03:43.040
It's open software, open source, and also it has already hundreds of installations around

30
0:03:43.040 --> 0:03:46.360
the world.

31
0:03:46.360 --> 0:03:49.080
It's written in PHP.

32
0:03:49.080 --> 0:03:54.200
It requires PHP 7.4 or above.

33
0:03:54.200 --> 0:04:03.320
It uses MySQL or MariaDB for the database part, runs on N-Zincs or Apache web server,

34
0:04:03.320 --> 0:04:10.480
and uses PDO extensions for JSON, M-B-String, OpenSSL, and PDO.

35
0:04:10.480 --> 0:04:17.040
It's a developer friendly with clean source code.

36
0:04:17.040 --> 0:04:19.040
Now the JITC part.

37
0:04:19.040 --> 0:04:25.760
JITC is a set of open source projects that allow easy teleconferencing.

38
0:04:25.760 --> 0:04:28.680
It's written in Java and JavaScript.

39
0:04:28.680 --> 0:04:32.320
It's compatible with web by RTC.

40
0:04:32.320 --> 0:04:39.640
JITC VideoBridges transmits video and audio to all participants separately, rather than

41
0:04:39.640 --> 0:04:42.720
combining them first.

42
0:04:42.720 --> 0:04:47.640
And of course it's open software.

43
0:04:47.640 --> 0:04:58.720
The platform now, on the first page, if that seems Greek to you, actually it is Greeks.

44
0:04:58.720 --> 0:05:07.200
In the first menu, the user can select the service he wants.

45
0:05:07.200 --> 0:05:13.600
After that, he selects specific agent or any available from the service.

46
0:05:13.600 --> 0:05:20.760
And finally, some information appears about the selected service, the duration of the

47
0:05:20.760 --> 0:05:21.760
appointment.

48
0:05:21.760 --> 0:05:31.160
On the bottom you can select also the interface language.

49
0:05:31.160 --> 0:05:37.760
We added the part that you can also arrange an online appointment.

50
0:05:37.760 --> 0:05:43.080
That's why we, maybe it's the same service, but rather than physically you want to do

51
0:05:43.080 --> 0:05:47.680
it online.

52
0:05:47.680 --> 0:05:57.000
On the second step, you choose the available dates and times of the service you choose.

53
0:05:57.000 --> 0:06:06.520
Or if you select a specific agent, you see his availability or any other agent available,

54
0:06:06.520 --> 0:06:11.120
you will see the calendar here.

55
0:06:11.120 --> 0:06:20.200
And the third step, a user inserts its information, first name, last name, and email, which in

56
0:06:20.200 --> 0:06:27.840
this email you will receive the details of the appointment and also the option to change

57
0:06:27.840 --> 0:06:31.760
or to cancel the appointment.

58
0:06:31.760 --> 0:06:45.720
The fourth step, all the details gathered for the appointment.

59
0:06:45.720 --> 0:06:55.640
And finally, when he submits the appointment, two emails are, he sees a confirmation message

60
0:06:55.640 --> 0:06:57.040
on the browser.

61
0:06:57.040 --> 0:07:05.040
Also the system generates two emails, one for the user with details and also from the

62
0:07:05.040 --> 0:07:11.040
selected agent to the selected service.

63
0:07:11.040 --> 0:07:19.400
The email he receives, again, the confirmation, the details, and also in case it's an online

64
0:07:19.400 --> 0:07:32.800
appointment, on the location field it will appear the unique video link to the DTC service.

65
0:07:32.800 --> 0:07:42.360
Also the user will receive an as an attachment and an ICS file which he can import it to

66
0:07:42.360 --> 0:07:45.400
the calendar.

67
0:07:45.400 --> 0:07:56.400
On the administration side, the agent sees all his meetings with information in an easy

68
0:07:56.400 --> 0:07:58.880
management environment.

69
0:07:58.880 --> 0:08:06.560
Also you have roles in the system so you can have directors of the service which they will

70
0:08:06.560 --> 0:08:14.360
see all the appointments.

71
0:08:14.360 --> 0:08:19.560
Some technical details about our prototype.

72
0:08:19.560 --> 0:08:25.920
We did minimal changes to easy appointments source code.

73
0:08:25.920 --> 0:08:31.560
So it will be also easy to use it.

74
0:08:31.560 --> 0:08:39.400
If the administrator doesn't set a physical location of a service because it's a service

75
0:08:39.400 --> 0:08:44.720
so you say the appointment is on this address or this building, this office.

76
0:08:44.720 --> 0:08:54.520
If this is empty, then the change we did, they generate a unique DTC link using the

77
0:08:54.520 --> 0:08:57.080
appointments hash.

78
0:08:57.080 --> 0:09:03.760
Each appointment has a unique hash in the database so we use this also as a link for

79
0:09:03.760 --> 0:09:06.080
the conference.

80
0:09:06.080 --> 0:09:13.520
We use the native location field to store the DTC link.

81
0:09:13.520 --> 0:09:20.240
We added the location field in the email the user receives.

82
0:09:20.240 --> 0:09:24.800
And administer to some settings.

83
0:09:24.800 --> 0:09:32.400
We also wanted to show some text with information on the homepage which wasn't an option in

84
0:09:32.400 --> 0:09:39.080
the appointment so we also added this and we wanted to change also the appearance.

85
0:09:39.080 --> 0:09:47.840
So we inserted a CSS file which from there you can change colors and some design of the

86
0:09:47.840 --> 0:09:52.040
pages.

87
0:09:52.040 --> 0:10:03.320
The source code is available on the GitHub you see here.

88
0:10:03.320 --> 0:10:06.000
That was our project.

89
0:10:06.000 --> 0:10:14.720
Thank you for coming.

90
0:10:14.720 --> 0:10:18.480
Does anyone have any questions?

91
0:10:18.480 --> 0:10:22.400
Because once further information.

92
0:10:22.400 --> 0:10:23.400
Yes.

93
0:10:23.400 --> 0:10:31.400
I understand that this is a port from the official DTF endpoint.

94
0:10:31.400 --> 0:10:32.400
Yes.

95
0:10:32.400 --> 0:10:35.400
So how do you manage with the new versions?

96
0:10:35.400 --> 0:10:48.080
Do you provide something like automatic combination to add some patches to the main project?

97
0:10:48.080 --> 0:10:51.360
This is a prototype.

98
0:10:51.360 --> 0:10:53.920
We spoke with the developer of his appointments.

99
0:10:53.920 --> 0:10:58.160
He has a system for plug-ins.

100
0:10:58.160 --> 0:11:03.360
So it could be written as a plug-in to his appointments.

101
0:11:03.360 --> 0:11:05.920
At the moment, no.

102
0:11:05.920 --> 0:11:08.640
You change the actual code.

103
0:11:08.640 --> 0:11:20.560
That's why also we wanted to make minimal changes.

104
0:11:20.560 --> 0:11:21.560
Thank you, Konstantinos.

105
0:11:21.560 --> 0:11:22.560
That was fantastic.

106
0:11:22.560 --> 0:11:23.560
Thank you.

107
0:11:23.560 --> 0:11:39.240
Thank you.
