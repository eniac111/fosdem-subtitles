1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:15.240
All right, everyone. Thank you. We have Emily O'Meer for the next talk, and she'll be doing

2
0:00:15.240 --> 0:00:20.600
her talk on do more awkward interview, more awkward user interviews. Do you feel awkward

3
0:00:20.600 --> 0:00:25.000
interviewing users about how they use your project? That's okay. Awkward interviews are

4
0:00:25.000 --> 0:00:32.080
often good interviews. I'll hand it over to Emily. Okay, excellent. Can everyone hear

5
0:00:32.080 --> 0:00:40.760
me? Cool. Okay, so how many of you feel really awkward when you do a user interview? Yes,

6
0:00:40.760 --> 0:00:45.520
okay. How many of you are really excited to learn about how you can make your user interviews

7
0:00:45.520 --> 0:00:52.080
even more awkward so you can feel... Okay, cool. That's what we're all here for. So I'm

8
0:00:52.080 --> 0:01:00.000
talking about two things basically that you should, A, do more user interviews regardless

9
0:01:00.000 --> 0:01:05.040
of how awkward you feel about them or not, and also that you should proactively employ

10
0:01:05.040 --> 0:01:09.920
techniques to make yourself feel more awkward, possibly also to make your interviewees feel

11
0:01:09.920 --> 0:01:14.360
a little bit more awkward, too. So I hope this sounds really awesome, and thank you

12
0:01:14.360 --> 0:01:20.320
all for joining me. The first thing that I... The first point that I want to make about

13
0:01:20.320 --> 0:01:26.280
doing user interviews and feeling awkward because a lot of people actually really hesitate

14
0:01:26.280 --> 0:01:29.960
to ask users in the first place because they feel like this is a huge ask. I'm going to

15
0:01:29.960 --> 0:01:34.260
ask literally like 30 minutes of somebody's time so they can feel really awkward just

16
0:01:34.260 --> 0:01:40.000
about that part. So remember though that this isn't actually how your user thinks about

17
0:01:40.000 --> 0:01:45.460
it. Doing a user interview, as in from the user's perspective, is actually a way for

18
0:01:45.460 --> 0:01:50.280
them to contribute to your project. It's a way for them to tell you what works, what

19
0:01:50.280 --> 0:01:56.440
doesn't, help you make the project better, and also people like to talk about themselves.

20
0:01:56.440 --> 0:02:02.640
You're giving the user an opportunity to talk about themselves, and from their perspective,

21
0:02:02.640 --> 0:02:07.040
hopefully get some of their needs met. They can give you their wish list. That doesn't

22
0:02:07.040 --> 0:02:12.000
mean you have to do everything on the wish list, but there is something in it for the

23
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:17.440
user. So don't get too hung up on that first ask and feel like this is a huge imposition

24
0:02:17.440 --> 0:02:25.600
on your user. Okay. So then let's talk about a little bit why you need these user interviews.

25
0:02:25.600 --> 0:02:31.440
You need to be able to understand who your users are. You need to understand why they're

26
0:02:31.440 --> 0:02:37.440
using your product or your project, why they care about it. You need to understand that

27
0:02:37.440 --> 0:02:41.720
in order to figure out how you're going to talk about your project and also figure out

28
0:02:41.720 --> 0:02:47.000
what you're going to do with your project next. What components of your project, what

29
0:02:47.000 --> 0:02:52.200
features are really useful to people, what things people really don't care about, what

30
0:02:52.200 --> 0:02:56.640
things would actually be helpful if they were added, what things potentially could actually

31
0:02:56.640 --> 0:03:00.880
detract from the value of your product if you were to build them. So user interviews

32
0:03:00.880 --> 0:03:05.760
are really important. They're also a really important part of building community. Again,

33
0:03:05.760 --> 0:03:09.600
something to keep in mind when you're feeling really awkward about asking for that user

34
0:03:09.600 --> 0:03:14.440
interview, it's a way for your users to feel more connected to you as a maintainer and

35
0:03:14.440 --> 0:03:21.640
more connected to the community. So user interviews, super important to do in the first place.

36
0:03:21.640 --> 0:03:26.400
And this is some of the information that I hope that everyone thinks of when they're

37
0:03:26.400 --> 0:03:31.800
doing their user interviews. Just an example of things that you're going to try to be getting

38
0:03:31.800 --> 0:03:36.400
extracting out of your users as you're doing these interviews. You want to know what triggered

39
0:03:36.400 --> 0:03:42.000
them to find your project. So did they hear about it at a conference like Fostem? If so,

40
0:03:42.000 --> 0:03:47.120
and you want more people to find out about your project, maybe you should go to more

41
0:03:47.120 --> 0:03:52.520
conferences. But you also want to know what triggered them to even look for something

42
0:03:52.520 --> 0:03:58.680
like your project in the first place. What were they trying to accomplish in that moment?

43
0:03:58.680 --> 0:04:03.280
Then you also want to know what do they compare your project to in their head. And sometimes

44
0:04:03.280 --> 0:04:08.840
you'll find answers like some other project, and it will be obvious. But oftentimes people

45
0:04:08.840 --> 0:04:14.040
don't actually compare a project to another project. They compare a project to spending

46
0:04:14.040 --> 0:04:20.100
four hours a month doing something manually. They might compare a project to paying a fine.

47
0:04:20.100 --> 0:04:25.240
They might compare a project to losing sleep at night because they are worried about whatever

48
0:04:25.240 --> 0:04:31.240
it is that your project solves. So understanding what that mental comparison is is going to

49
0:04:31.240 --> 0:04:36.040
help you talk about your project more effectively, understand where your project needs to go

50
0:04:36.040 --> 0:04:41.080
in the future, and make more of a connection with your community.

51
0:04:41.080 --> 0:04:44.880
So another thing that you need to understand is how they interact with your project. Is

52
0:04:44.880 --> 0:04:49.880
this something that they actually touch every day, every week? Or is it something that runs

53
0:04:49.880 --> 0:04:54.920
in the background and is really critical but it's very easy for everybody to forget? Especially

54
0:04:54.920 --> 0:05:00.720
if you have a project that's used in a team situation, you want to know who on the team

55
0:05:00.720 --> 0:05:06.000
is interacting with the project and in what way. You'd also want to know who was the champion.

56
0:05:06.000 --> 0:05:09.920
So maybe you have five people on the team who are interacting with your project. Who

57
0:05:09.920 --> 0:05:14.760
was the champion? How did they then evangelize it within that team?

58
0:05:14.760 --> 0:05:21.920
And then you also want to know if, hopefully there was one, but if there was a magic moment,

59
0:05:21.920 --> 0:05:26.600
what that moment was. So when they first started using your project, what was the sort of a-ha

60
0:05:26.600 --> 0:05:33.600
moment when they were like, oh, now I understand how this is working. This is so awesome. And

61
0:05:33.600 --> 0:05:38.600
the understanding what that moment is, is really important so that you know what to

62
0:05:38.600 --> 0:05:45.600
optimize and how to make the process for a new user of getting to that magic moment as

63
0:05:45.600 --> 0:05:47.480
smooth as possible.

64
0:05:47.480 --> 0:05:54.440
All right. So let's talk some more about goals, right? Okay. So what's your goal when you're

65
0:05:54.440 --> 0:05:58.160
doing a user interview? I've just talked about some of these things. This is a pop quiz.

66
0:05:58.160 --> 0:06:04.280
Is it to get some really amazing information about your project or is it to make yourself

67
0:06:04.280 --> 0:06:14.040
look awesome and smart? Which? Okay. So there is a little bit of a caveat here. You don't

68
0:06:14.040 --> 0:06:18.860
want to make yourself look like a total moron, especially, you know, people are trusting

69
0:06:18.860 --> 0:06:22.600
you so you don't want them, like, if they're using your project, you don't want them to

70
0:06:22.600 --> 0:06:27.080
think you're a total moron, especially if you're, like, trying to monetize this project

71
0:06:27.080 --> 0:06:33.280
in any way, in any way, depending on it financially. However, you also don't want to get hung up

72
0:06:33.280 --> 0:06:37.680
on the idea of making yourself look good during this interview. That is not the point of a

73
0:06:37.680 --> 0:06:43.960
user interview. The point is to get some really good information. So some of these techniques,

74
0:06:43.960 --> 0:06:48.160
these interview techniques are from journalism. I used to be a journalist. When you're a journalist,

75
0:06:48.160 --> 0:06:51.720
you don't really care what your sources think of you. If they think you're an idiot, that's

76
0:06:51.720 --> 0:06:57.200
okay. So just to acknowledge, there are some limits. But then again, you know, your users

77
0:06:57.200 --> 0:07:02.720
are coming into this, they already respect you, they know your work as a maintainer,

78
0:07:02.720 --> 0:07:08.200
they depend and they like your project. So you don't need to show them how awesome you

79
0:07:08.200 --> 0:07:16.400
are. They already know that. Okay. So here are the two, like, awkward interview techniques

80
0:07:16.400 --> 0:07:22.400
that I want people to take away from this. So one is to strategically deploy awkward

81
0:07:22.400 --> 0:07:28.900
silences. The second one is to ask so many follow-up questions you risk looking dumb.

82
0:07:28.900 --> 0:07:38.280
But let's talk about the first one, the awkward silences. Okay. So in Western cultures, most

83
0:07:38.280 --> 0:07:43.440
cultures, it is a little bit culture-bound, but after a certain amount of time in a conversation,

84
0:07:43.440 --> 0:07:49.840
people start to feel like this silence is really awkward. And if you're in a conversation,

85
0:07:49.840 --> 0:07:54.480
that's really easy. You just ask the other person another question, boom, problem solved.

86
0:07:54.480 --> 0:07:58.920
But if this is an interview and one person is asking questions and the other person is

87
0:07:58.920 --> 0:08:06.960
answering them, and the interviewee has finished answering their question, and the interviewer

88
0:08:06.960 --> 0:08:13.520
doesn't do anything and just sits there and is silent, it's going to make the interviewee

89
0:08:13.520 --> 0:08:18.560
start talking again. And what happens is that first answer that you get to the question

90
0:08:18.560 --> 0:08:25.880
is like the pre-planned canned answer that they've already sort of mentally vetted to

91
0:08:25.880 --> 0:08:30.560
make themselves look good, possibly to make their organization look good and not reveal

92
0:08:30.560 --> 0:08:34.520
anything that's too embarrassing. That's good. I mean, you're going to get some good information

93
0:08:34.520 --> 0:08:39.720
there, but if you want to get beyond that, then after that person has finished answering

94
0:08:39.720 --> 0:08:51.120
the question, just let it sit and let it feel a little bit awkward. And if you can stand,

95
0:08:51.120 --> 0:08:56.800
if you can sit with that awkward silence long enough, the interviewee will start talking

96
0:08:56.800 --> 0:09:02.480
again. And when he or she starts talking again, that's where you get the information that

97
0:09:02.480 --> 0:09:07.120
they haven't really pre-vetted with themselves. They'll start rambling. You'll get the sort

98
0:09:07.120 --> 0:09:15.240
of like more emotional, more off the cuff answers to questions like, why did this matter?

99
0:09:15.240 --> 0:09:20.760
Or why did you want to do that? Even if you were to interview somebody about what they

100
0:09:20.760 --> 0:09:26.140
had for breakfast, I can guarantee you that if you just let an awkward silence sit there,

101
0:09:26.140 --> 0:09:30.600
they would start rambling on about why they chose whatever they had for breakfast because

102
0:09:30.600 --> 0:09:41.240
they feel like they need to fill that awkward silence. So the next thing, the next technique

103
0:09:41.240 --> 0:09:47.840
is follow-up questions. Let's use the breakfast example again. So you ask somebody, what did

104
0:09:47.840 --> 0:09:55.560
you have for breakfast? And they said, I had a croissant. And then you ask them why. Then

105
0:09:55.560 --> 0:09:59.040
you're going to start getting some more information. And then maybe they say, you know, that's

106
0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:04.880
all that was available. And then you ask them why. And you keep asking why again. This can

107
0:10:04.880 --> 0:10:09.040
start to feel a little bit uncomfortable because you're really pressing people to talk about

108
0:10:09.040 --> 0:10:17.360
their core motivation. But you're also getting information that is much deeper, much richer.

109
0:10:17.360 --> 0:10:22.760
And one of the tricks here and the thing that can honestly make you risk looking like an

110
0:10:22.760 --> 0:10:27.720
idiot is that you want to try not to assume anything. And particularly, this can be hard

111
0:10:27.720 --> 0:10:34.080
in a technical situation because there are some times when you want to show that you're

112
0:10:34.080 --> 0:10:39.440
not an idiot, you know why this was important. When somebody is like, we felt like we had

113
0:10:39.440 --> 0:10:46.000
to improve our supply chain security. And you ask why. It's like, well, isn't it obvious

114
0:10:46.000 --> 0:10:51.600
why we had to do that? But actually, it's not because why at that moment was that suddenly

115
0:10:51.600 --> 0:10:58.320
a priority. Why hadn't you done it before? So keep asking those why questions to try

116
0:10:58.320 --> 0:11:04.720
to dive into really understanding what the motivation is and not assuming anything. Even

117
0:11:04.720 --> 0:11:10.880
if it seems like, you know, it should be self-evident what the answer is, don't make that assumption.

118
0:11:10.880 --> 0:11:21.040
All right. So I am going to give you some homework. This homework is really easy. Choose

119
0:11:21.040 --> 0:11:27.400
a friend or a colleague and ask them to do an interview with you. It can be about anything.

120
0:11:27.400 --> 0:11:32.720
It can be what they did yesterday evening, what they had for breakfast. And I want you

121
0:11:32.720 --> 0:11:40.920
to try and see what happens when you don't jump in with a new question and just let that

122
0:11:40.920 --> 0:11:46.320
awkward silence hang. The key to doing this is that you have to set the expectations that

123
0:11:46.320 --> 0:11:51.440
this is an interview. So the other person is not allowed to ask you a question in return.

124
0:11:51.440 --> 0:11:57.080
They're only allowed to answer the questions that you're asking them. And the reason that

125
0:11:57.080 --> 0:12:02.720
I actually recommend practicing this is because it is way harder than you expect. It should

126
0:12:02.720 --> 0:12:08.920
be really easy, right? You're just sitting there quietly. But it goes against, like,

127
0:12:08.920 --> 0:12:16.480
your whole being to just let that silence sit there for as long as you can possibly

128
0:12:16.480 --> 0:12:26.760
stand. And that is why it works, quite honestly. Okay. So that's it. I'm Emily O'Meer. You

129
0:12:26.760 --> 0:12:31.600
can I have a podcast. It's called the business of open source. You can connect with me on

130
0:12:31.600 --> 0:12:37.240
my website. You can write me an email. I'm also on LinkedIn. You can send me a message

131
0:12:37.240 --> 0:12:40.360
on LinkedIn. You can just search for my name and you will find me. I don't think there's

132
0:12:40.360 --> 0:12:45.760
anyone else with my name. Before we wrap up, though, is there anybody who has questions?

133
0:12:45.760 --> 0:12:47.600
Yes.

134
0:12:47.600 --> 0:12:53.600
Do I need a microphone for this? Or is it more effective to do this with a microphone

135
0:12:53.600 --> 0:12:54.600
or?

136
0:12:54.600 --> 0:12:56.600
Just ask the question and I'll repeat it.

137
0:12:56.600 --> 0:12:59.920
Is it more effective to do this with a microphone?

138
0:12:59.920 --> 0:13:01.920
Oh, is that the question?

139
0:13:01.920 --> 0:13:11.920
You mean if you're doing a user interview? I mean, honestly, when I do interviews, I

140
0:13:11.920 --> 0:13:19.640
use Zoom. So I just use whatever's on my computer. But no, it doesn't matter. This is a situation

141
0:13:19.640 --> 0:13:26.400
where technology just doesn't matter. Whatever, however you do an interview doesn't matter.

142
0:13:26.400 --> 0:13:30.760
On the other hand, I will say I understand where the question's coming from because people

143
0:13:30.760 --> 0:13:36.520
do behave differently when you put a microphone in front of their face. So if anything, no,

144
0:13:36.520 --> 0:13:45.080
do not put a microphone in front of people's face because that triggers the self-sensor.

145
0:13:45.080 --> 0:13:49.080
And what you want is to get rid of the self-sensor. Yes?

146
0:13:49.080 --> 0:14:01.080
So you said that people shouldn't ask a question of you during this interview. One way information.

147
0:14:01.080 --> 0:14:02.080
Yep.

148
0:14:02.080 --> 0:14:07.160
If they do ask a question, do you stay silent to increase your view?

149
0:14:07.160 --> 0:14:14.120
So the question is if the interviewee asks you a question, should you just stay silent

150
0:14:14.120 --> 0:14:21.760
to increase the awkwardness? That's a really good question. I'm not sure. That's actually

151
0:14:21.760 --> 0:14:29.840
never happened to me. So I don't really have a good... I think I would go for just answering

152
0:14:29.840 --> 0:14:34.080
the question and then asking a follow-up.

153
0:14:34.080 --> 0:14:35.080
So you're...

154
0:14:35.080 --> 0:14:37.080
You could ask an answer question with a question.

155
0:14:37.080 --> 0:14:42.720
Yeah, you could do that too. So I think I would just... You want to use the two techniques

156
0:14:42.720 --> 0:14:47.080
together anyway. All right. We probably have time for one more question. Yes?

157
0:14:47.080 --> 0:14:53.280
Does being awkward ever break the interview or the trust and make it harder to go on?

158
0:14:53.280 --> 0:14:58.360
The question is does being awkward ever break the trust and make it even harder to go on?

159
0:14:58.360 --> 0:15:05.240
In my experience, no. I have never had a situation where being awkward broke the interviewee's

160
0:15:05.240 --> 0:15:12.240
trust. I don't think so. I mean, there's probably... There is a limit, right? But as long as you're

161
0:15:12.240 --> 0:15:20.440
being polite, then I wouldn't worry about that. And if you have any sense of social

162
0:15:20.440 --> 0:15:26.320
grace whatsoever, you will probably totally max out on your awkwardness well before you

163
0:15:26.320 --> 0:15:28.840
would break someone's trust.

164
0:15:28.840 --> 0:15:43.040
All right. Yeah. Okay. We have seven seconds. So thank you so much.
