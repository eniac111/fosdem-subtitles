0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.560
Bonjour. It's a great honor to be present among you. I'm sorry I speak English like

2
0:00:11.560 --> 0:00:21.920
an average French. And I asked, obviously, I asked ChatGPT and Google Translate to write

3
0:00:21.920 --> 0:00:29.580
me my speech. So if it doesn't work for you, it's the algorithm fault, obviously. My name

4
0:00:29.580 --> 0:00:34.600
is Alexis Kofmann, and I'm going to present to you a Forge project for all teachers and

5
0:00:34.600 --> 0:00:46.760
students in France. So a Forge project that forced them, so what? Nothing less original.

6
0:00:46.760 --> 0:00:51.400
But three points in which, in my opinion, distinguish this Forge from other classical

7
0:00:51.400 --> 0:01:01.560
forges. Users are teachers and K-12 students, so up to 18 years old for school, not for

8
0:01:01.560 --> 0:01:10.280
the university. Shared content is educational, pedagogical content, and there's more text

9
0:01:10.280 --> 0:01:20.520
in markup languages than code. And last but not least, the project is supported by the

10
0:01:20.520 --> 0:01:32.560
French state. A few words about me. Basically, I'm a high school math teacher for 25 years,

11
0:01:32.560 --> 0:01:46.880
but also a kind of screen software activist having founded the

12
0:01:46.880 --> 0:01:54.880
French. And for years, we hoped, we, from ourself, we hoped for a real free software

13
0:01:54.880 --> 0:02:01.480
policy in French education, and elsewhere and worldwide, obviously. But that did not

14
0:02:01.480 --> 0:02:10.840
real come. I remember 10 years ago, as a president of from ourself, I wrote an article titled

15
0:02:10.840 --> 0:02:17.640
My Ministry Drives Me to Despair, where I said this, either my ministry doesn't know

16
0:02:17.640 --> 0:02:25.200
that free software exists and then it is irresponsible and incompetent, or it knows it and does nothing

17
0:02:25.200 --> 0:02:32.100
and then it is guilty. By having such remarks publicly, you can well imagine that I would

18
0:02:32.100 --> 0:02:40.360
never have thought of funding myself one day in the ministry. But today, times have changed.

19
0:02:40.360 --> 0:02:45.720
I was invited to join the ministry a year ago and I accepted the challenge. This is

20
0:02:45.720 --> 0:02:52.600
the first time that there is such free software and open educational resources project manager

21
0:02:52.600 --> 0:03:02.720
in the institution and quite high in the organization chart. And I think it's a good sign. Another

22
0:03:02.720 --> 0:03:11.440
good sign, we don't just use free software, we also contribute. For example, we found

23
0:03:11.440 --> 0:03:20.640
a development for the open source video conferencing tool, BigBlueButton, and it's unusual to read

24
0:03:20.640 --> 0:03:31.400
this in a project repose. And we contribute to other free software projects like NextCloud,

25
0:03:31.400 --> 0:03:45.080
Future or Moodle. So, another positive move, this Forge project. It responds to two needs

26
0:03:45.080 --> 0:03:54.680
expressed by the teachers. The first is a classic one. We are nearly a million teachers

27
0:03:54.680 --> 0:04:00.840
in France and among them there are those who develop free software application for education.

28
0:04:00.840 --> 0:04:09.040
And some of which have a great potential. But all these projects are scattered and it is

29
0:04:09.040 --> 0:04:18.360
difficult to spot them and then it's difficult to support them. And for ethical and GDPR reasons,

30
0:04:18.360 --> 0:04:26.480
we cannot also tell our teachers to go to Microsoft GitHub. So, let's bring them together

31
0:04:26.480 --> 0:04:35.080
in a sovereign and secure space. And as we have computers courses from high school now

32
0:04:35.080 --> 0:04:46.320
in France, this also concerns students. Firstly, the second need corresponds to new uses. Here

33
0:04:46.320 --> 0:04:54.320
we share a lot more formatted text, markdown, LaTeX, than code to create educational content

34
0:04:54.320 --> 0:05:06.320
together. And here we create content in the dark mode image which will then be pushed

35
0:05:06.320 --> 0:05:19.280
into web pages, print PDF for a Jupyter Notebook. By using the pages function of the Forge, you

36
0:05:19.280 --> 0:05:27.160
can work collaboratively on the Forge to produce web pages, websites with quality educational

37
0:05:27.160 --> 0:05:35.280
content as in this project with computer science teachers. And you can do this without leaving

38
0:05:35.280 --> 0:05:48.360
the web environment, without knowing git pull, git push, etc. Another example in CI, in

39
0:05:48.360 --> 0:06:03.000
continuous integration, we can also push markdown into a pretty mind map as a philosophy teacher

40
0:06:03.000 --> 0:06:13.360
suggests here. Just to emphasize that it's not just science teachers who work this way.

41
0:06:13.360 --> 0:06:22.840
So, two needs expressed by teachers for a Forge of code and text. So, let's do it. And

42
0:06:22.840 --> 0:06:31.280
the Forge already exists as a proof of concept since last September with 200 projects or

43
0:06:31.280 --> 0:06:41.160
300 accounts. It's a GitLab instance powered by a French PE platform as a service, CleverCloud,

44
0:06:41.160 --> 0:06:47.760
who have a stand here at first then. And administered by the, an association, a teacher's

45
0:06:47.760 --> 0:06:57.680
association, the association of computer science teacher of France, the R-O-E-F. The big news

46
0:06:57.680 --> 0:07:05.600
just from 10 days ago is that the project has been validated by the ministry which has

47
0:07:05.600 --> 0:07:17.440
integrated it into its big strategy, the digital strategy for education 2023, 2027. So, the

48
0:07:17.440 --> 0:07:27.120
prototype Forge will join the IT services of the ministry. I cannot give you more details

49
0:07:27.120 --> 0:07:33.800
because the project is just beginning, so no road map, etc. But we have at least five

50
0:07:33.800 --> 0:07:45.840
years to move forward. To move forward and convince of its interests more and more teachers

51
0:07:45.840 --> 0:07:55.040
and students. This is the big challenge. Succeed in enlarging the cycle of users. This will

52
0:07:55.040 --> 0:08:03.960
require support, training, animation, and promotion of the projects submitted. Here,

53
0:08:03.960 --> 0:08:13.120
you can see a quick and dirty sweat and eyelashes. The most important thing for me is that the

54
0:08:13.120 --> 0:08:19.920
project is supported by the institution and that it has values close to an event like

55
0:08:19.920 --> 0:08:31.360
the post-dem. So, I have just one minute, huh? Okay. So, I don't detail the strengths,

56
0:08:31.360 --> 0:08:39.680
opportunities, or weaknesses. So, thank you. I came to post-dem to present this project,

57
0:08:39.680 --> 0:08:48.360
but also despite my terrible level of English to discuss and see if other countries, other

58
0:08:48.360 --> 0:08:54.960
ministry of education in Europe, for instance, are engaged in similar projects to pull and

59
0:08:54.960 --> 0:09:05.040
share our experiences. Okay. Don't hesitate to talk about it around you if you think the

60
0:09:05.040 --> 0:09:19.240
project is interesting. And, thank you.

61
0:09:19.240 --> 0:09:44.200
Thanks for your attention. If there is anyone who has a question, is there anyone who has

62
0:09:44.200 --> 0:09:51.200
a question? In French, in English, also in chat GPT language.

63
0:09:51.200 --> 0:10:05.720
No, but I can, if we have time, I can read with you a first list of positive points and

64
0:10:05.720 --> 0:10:16.720
risks. So, obviously, the main thing is that it's an institutional project that carries

65
0:10:16.720 --> 0:10:24.160
values, openness, sharing, ethics, sovereignty. Sovereignty is important here and sustainability.

66
0:10:24.160 --> 0:10:31.000
It encourages teachers and students to work together and so increase digital and computer

67
0:10:31.000 --> 0:10:39.800
skills, I think. And by gathering our force, join the force in the same place, it's easier

68
0:10:39.800 --> 0:10:50.960
to make community and obtainment. It's easier to ask money. And doing so, I hope we will

69
0:10:50.960 --> 0:11:00.480
have a big, a large bank of open educational content with free license available to the

70
0:11:00.480 --> 0:11:11.560
entire school community. There is also a point with what in France we call it so britais

71
0:11:11.560 --> 0:11:21.640
numÃ©ry, the digital sobriety. I think it's not a good translation. But because we use

72
0:11:21.640 --> 0:11:30.400
light and open format, we can work offline, it's improving existing rather than beginning

73
0:11:30.400 --> 0:11:46.760
from scratch, et cetera, et cetera. And important, the project for us is a commons. So, it's governance

74
0:11:46.760 --> 0:11:52.160
and policy is shared with the users. That's very important because we did a lot of projects,

75
0:11:52.160 --> 0:12:01.320
a lot of top-down projects in the French Ministry of Education. These want to be more horizontal.

76
0:12:01.320 --> 0:12:07.360
Not very expensive, but at first, at the beginning. But if there is a lot more and more users

77
0:12:07.360 --> 0:12:19.760
with CICD, it can be different. And the threats, maybe it's too complex tool for our teachers

78
0:12:19.760 --> 0:12:29.360
and students if we want more and more users. So, great news for documentation training,

79
0:12:29.360 --> 0:12:40.920
animation. And convents, great teachers who are already on forges to migrate to our forges.

80
0:12:40.920 --> 0:12:48.480
That's a point because super teachers are already on GitHub, for instance. A copyright

81
0:12:48.480 --> 0:12:59.240
stuff. This is not clear if the content belongs to the agents or the teacher or to the states.

82
0:12:59.240 --> 0:13:10.920
So, there is a thing to end the evolution of GitLab offer. And the competition with

83
0:13:10.920 --> 0:13:19.200
Microsoft GitHub, with Copilot and Chattera with more and more new functions. Voila.

84
0:13:19.200 --> 0:13:30.240
Thank you.
