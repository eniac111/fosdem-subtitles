00:00.000 --> 00:10.940
Hi, everybody. My name is Drew Devault, and today I'm going to give a quick talk giving

00:10.940 --> 00:20.760
you a sneak peek at a microkernel I've been working on called Helios. So why should we

00:20.760 --> 00:25.860
write new kernels? These are the reasons that I came up with for writing new kernels. You

00:25.860 --> 00:30.320
know, is Linux good enough? I don't know, but kernel hacking is really, really fun,

00:30.320 --> 00:35.360
so I'm enjoying myself working on it, which is reason enough. I also want to prove if

00:35.360 --> 00:40.840
the programming language Herr is useful for writing kernels. Herr is a programming language

00:40.840 --> 00:44.120
I developed along with many of the people in this room and many people outside of this

00:44.120 --> 00:49.880
room, which one of the stated goals is to be useful for systems programming and to be

00:49.880 --> 00:53.240
able to write kernels with. So in order to prove that that's possible, we have to write

00:53.240 --> 00:58.680
a kernel. Other goals is I want to know if we can do better than the SEL4 microkernel,

00:58.680 --> 01:04.360
which is a microkernel that inspired a lot of the system design for Helios. And if I

01:04.360 --> 01:09.080
were to be particularly ambitious and bold, I would wonder if it's possible to do better

01:09.080 --> 01:14.200
than Linux. And so we've had Linux now for, what, 30 years? Maybe a little bit less than

01:14.200 --> 01:20.160
30 years. And I think it's time for some innovation in kernels. SEL4 is cool, but maybe we can

01:20.160 --> 01:23.840
do better. And you know, at the end of the day, we're having fun doing it and that's

01:23.840 --> 01:32.000
enough. So enter Helios. Helios is a microkernel, which again is largely inspired by SEL4 and

01:32.000 --> 01:36.400
is written in Herr to prove that Herr can be used to write kernels and also because

01:36.400 --> 01:41.720
it's fun to write kernels and maybe we can make it good. It runs right now on x86.64

01:41.720 --> 01:47.160
and ARM64 and support for RISC-V is coming, which is all of the targets that Herr presently

01:47.160 --> 01:53.240
supports. The kernel itself is quite small. The portable code base is about 8,500 lines

01:53.240 --> 01:57.520
of code. And then on top of that, for each architecture, we have about 3,000 lines of

01:57.520 --> 02:02.080
code. And that's it. That's the whole microkernel. The kernel is licensed under the GNU public

02:02.080 --> 02:07.000
license and I suppose here, I should mention these small line codes don't include the boot

02:07.000 --> 02:12.800
loaders, which themselves maybe add 2,000 lines of code per target. And it's written

02:12.800 --> 02:17.640
in Herr, which is again a systems programming language that I designed with the help of

02:17.640 --> 02:23.600
about 80 contributors. This is the pitch from the website, but the short version is that

02:23.600 --> 02:28.760
Herr is a systems programming language, which is designed to be very simple. We have a specification

02:28.760 --> 02:33.640
which is less than 100 pages. We have a small compiler. We have a minimal runtime, manual

02:33.640 --> 02:38.720
memory management. And the goals is to use it for systems programming. So that includes

02:38.720 --> 02:46.120
others, daemons, system tools, and also things like kernels.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.320
Further about Herr, again, it's a general purpose systems programming language. So in

02:50.320 --> 02:55.600
addition to kernels, we also use it in user space on Linux and FreeBSD, working on OpenBSD

02:55.600 --> 03:01.600
and NetBSD user space support as well. We've been working on it now for about three years.

03:01.600 --> 03:08.040
And the footprint of the programming language is also small. We have an 18,000 line compiler,

03:08.040 --> 03:13.760
our backend cube, not LLVM. Our backend is cube, which is about 12,000 lines of C99.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.840
And together, this is enough to bootstrap the compiler plus, you know, bin utils is

03:17.840 --> 03:22.960
required. And it runs again on these three targets.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.960
If you've never seen any Herr code before, I just have a small sample here. I'm not going

03:26.960 --> 03:32.360
to go into too much detail about exactly what any of this code does. But this is just what

03:32.360 --> 03:37.160
it looks like. If you're familiar with C, a lot of things here probably look fairly

03:37.160 --> 03:43.400
recognizable to you. Some things maybe don't. Namespaces are nice, you know. But this is

03:43.400 --> 03:47.280
just a peek at what Herr looks like. And this particular code sample is the entry point

03:47.280 --> 03:51.200
for the Helios microkernel. So this is the first line of portable code. There's also

03:51.200 --> 03:56.000
some architecture specific setup code, and the bootloader runs before any of this. But

03:56.000 --> 04:01.160
this is the first line of code that runs on all architectures.

04:01.160 --> 04:08.000
So what is Helios? What is the goal of the design? It's a microkernel, so it's designed

04:08.000 --> 04:12.200
to be as small as possible and to move any tasks which can be performed in user space

04:12.200 --> 04:17.480
into user space contrasted with something like Linux, which is a monolithic design.

04:17.480 --> 04:22.560
The kernel is very, very small and simple. It only has 14 syscalls of which 12 related

04:22.560 --> 04:28.160
to capabilities. A user's capability-based security, which is essentially this means

04:28.160 --> 04:33.960
of controlling access to resources on the system like memory, like hardware I.O., memory

04:33.960 --> 04:39.920
mapped I.O., processes, threads, address spaces. All of these things are represented by capabilities,

04:39.920 --> 04:45.320
and the syscall API is used for working with those capabilities. And then each process

04:45.320 --> 04:48.760
on the system has access to some subset of capabilities, which entitles it to rights

04:48.760 --> 04:54.560
to use resources, which is a really good approach for sandboxing and security.

04:54.560 --> 04:59.480
It's especially good when compared to a monolithic design like Linux. The example I usually reach

04:59.480 --> 05:05.200
for to explain why Helios's design is more secure than Linux is to consider the case

05:05.200 --> 05:10.200
of a floppy disk driver. So if you have a floppy disk driver on Linux, it's compiled

05:10.200 --> 05:15.000
into your kernel and runs in ring 0. And if there's a bug in it, the worst thing that

05:15.000 --> 05:19.760
bug can do is completely compromise your system. Whereas on Helios, the worst thing a bug in

05:19.760 --> 05:25.480
your floppy disk driver could do is erase your floppy disk. All drivers, in addition

05:25.480 --> 05:30.240
to user space processes, are sandboxed with the MMU, just like user space processes generally

05:30.240 --> 05:34.960
are on systems like Linux. Of course, for a microkernel, inter-process communication

05:34.960 --> 05:40.760
is critical. We have two approaches to IPC, which again are largely inspired by SEL4.

05:40.760 --> 05:45.360
We have synchronous IPC via endpoints and asynchronous via notifications, as well as

05:45.360 --> 05:50.400
the ability to set up shared memory so that you can communicate more efficiently than

05:50.400 --> 05:59.120
using SysCalls for IPC. Where is the project at now? It's fairly mature. We're about nine

05:59.120 --> 06:05.040
months in. The capabilities are working. Inter-process communication is also working. We also have

06:05.040 --> 06:09.640
preemptive scheduling, so we do actually have processes which get scheduled. But the scheduler

06:09.640 --> 06:15.040
is very simple. We don't have support for SMP yet, so it's all running on one core.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.200
And it's just a simple round robin scheduler, but we will make improvements in this domain.

06:19.200 --> 06:24.160
We also have support for hardware IO and IRQs, both in user space, so it is now possible

06:24.160 --> 06:29.840
to write user space drivers for hardware in Helios or on top of Helios. And in terms of

06:29.840 --> 06:35.520
booting, we currently have support for EFI on ARM and multi-boot on X8664. We're going

06:35.520 --> 06:40.480
to also bring EFI to X8664 as soon as somebody can be bothered to implement position independent

06:40.480 --> 06:48.160
code for our back-end. And does it work? The answer is self-evidently yes, because this

06:48.160 --> 06:51.960
slide deck you're viewing right now is running on this Raspberry Pi, which is running on

06:51.960 --> 06:58.620
Helios. I promised that I would not do any talks about Helios until I could actually

06:58.620 --> 07:05.600
present that talk from Helios. And I initially was going to try and write an Intel HD graphics

07:05.600 --> 07:11.160
driver from X86 laptop, and then I started looking at the IHD manuals, of which there's

07:11.160 --> 07:19.320
about 18 volumes per Intel hardware revision. Among those are about 100,000 pages of PDF.

07:19.320 --> 07:24.520
And after about two days of reading those PDFs, I forgot about that and instead ported

07:24.520 --> 07:31.240
the entire kernel to ARM so I could write GPU driver for the Raspberry Pi instead. That

07:31.240 --> 07:37.840
ARM port took about 42 days to complete from start to finish. The Raspberry Pi here is

07:37.840 --> 07:42.880
running its GPU driver and a serial driver in user space. The GPU driver is driving the

07:42.880 --> 07:49.200
projector and I'm switching between slides by typing letters into the serial port. The

07:49.200 --> 07:55.640
slide deck itself is encoded as QOI, quite okay, images, on a tarball, which essentially

07:55.640 --> 08:02.320
acts like an INIT RAMFS. And there's basically no hacks here. There's no smoke and mirrors.

08:02.320 --> 08:08.280
I actually ported the entire Helios kernel to ARM. There's no SOC specific build, so

08:08.280 --> 08:12.760
this same configuration should work on any other ARM device, which implements an EFI

08:12.760 --> 08:17.800
boot. I am using EDK to boot through EFI. I'm using device trees to enumerate the hardware

08:17.800 --> 08:22.640
instead of drivers. So there's very little on the way of hacks. 42 days for a complete

08:22.640 --> 08:34.200
port to ARM. No hacks. It just works.

08:34.200 --> 08:41.920
Thank you. So where's the project going from here? The kernel itself is done in big error

08:41.920 --> 08:47.560
quotes in terms of the fact that it's almost functionally complete. It needs to be polished

08:47.560 --> 08:52.520
and we need to, you know, if you do a Git grep on todo, you find about 100 things that

08:52.520 --> 08:58.080
still need to be fixed, just little stuff. We need to add multiprocessing support. I

08:58.080 --> 09:02.960
want to port it to RISC-V as well, which maybe it'll take more than 40 days because I'm not

09:02.960 --> 09:08.600
going to kill myself over this one without a deadline like Fostom. I mentioned earlier

09:08.600 --> 09:14.560
that I want to expand the bootloader options, so I want to add EFI support for x86.64 and

09:14.560 --> 09:20.240
we also intend to boot RISC-V over EFI. And I want to improve the documentation, of course.

09:20.240 --> 09:26.440
The docs are actually already kind of okay. They're at aries.org. If you're curious, the

09:26.440 --> 09:31.840
kernel docs are maybe about 60% complete. And if you're curious to play with Helios,

09:31.840 --> 09:38.120
you can definitely use those as a starting point and ask an IRC if you encounter a stub

09:38.120 --> 09:45.200
where there should be docs. In the big picture, this is our plans. So, like I said, the kernel

09:45.200 --> 09:48.440
is almost functionally complete, but it's a macrokernel, so that doesn't mean that it

09:48.440 --> 09:54.080
can necessarily do very much that it's useful. But we're going to go to user space and build

09:54.080 --> 10:02.200
more stuff. We have this idea of kind of layers of support. So at the core is the microkernel,

10:02.200 --> 10:06.840
Helios, but then we're going to build additional projects on top of it, which will expand it

10:06.840 --> 10:11.720
into a complete operating system. We have now Mercury, which is a driver framework.

10:11.720 --> 10:16.840
This already exists and is fairly mature and has become even more so in the past week or

10:16.840 --> 10:21.240
so. And then we've just started last week working on Venus, which is going to be our

10:21.240 --> 10:26.880
collection of drivers. Just any kind of hardware that we want to support, the driver for it

10:26.880 --> 10:30.760
will probably end up in Venus and be built on top of the Mercury framework. And together

10:30.760 --> 10:37.000
these will present an interface to Gaia, which will take these abstractions for accessing

10:37.000 --> 10:43.840
hardware and build them into an actual programming environment, which will resemble Unix or Plan

10:43.840 --> 10:49.240
9. We're also going to build Luna, which will be a POSIX compatibility layer. Gaia itself

10:49.240 --> 10:55.480
will not be POSIX. I think that there's room for beyond POSIX, I hope. But we do want POSIX

10:55.480 --> 10:58.980
software to work, so we'll have this compatibility layer. And then we'll tie it all together

10:58.980 --> 11:03.440
with Ares, which will be a more complete operating system that provides a package manager and

11:03.440 --> 11:11.440
a service manager and other things that you might be used to from a complete experience.

11:11.440 --> 11:18.560
I want to give some quick acknowledgments as well to the people who made this possible.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.840
I want to thank Ember Savadi and Alexei Yeren in particular for their early experiments

11:22.840 --> 11:28.860
with kernel programming in HAIR. These early kernels for x86 and RISC-V, they never made

11:28.860 --> 11:32.840
it to user space. They weren't very sophisticated, but they did answer a lot of the problems

11:32.840 --> 11:37.560
that needed to be answered for us to know how do we do HAIR development in RISC-0. And

11:37.560 --> 11:42.720
so this was very valuable for establishing things like booting up, dealing with the MMU,

11:42.720 --> 11:47.880
and other questions for how to get a kernel going in HAIR. And the HAIR community itself

11:47.880 --> 11:51.880
deserves a big shout out because none of this would be possible without the immense amount

11:51.880 --> 11:55.640
of work which people have put into it. Many of the people who contributed to HAIR are

11:55.640 --> 12:00.520
in this room and I offer them my thanks. But many people are not here. There's about 80

12:00.520 --> 12:05.720
people who run into making HAIR possible. I also want to thank the OS dev community

12:05.720 --> 12:11.440
on the Barat Chats IRC. These guys are incredibly smart and incredibly friendly and incredibly

12:11.440 --> 12:15.280
helpful. And if you want to get involved in kernel hacking and do any kind of work in

12:15.280 --> 12:21.360
RISC-0 yourself, this is an indispensable resource. Definitely check these guys out.

12:21.360 --> 12:27.860
And also we owe some acknowledgements to SEL4 because a lot of our design is inspired or

12:27.860 --> 12:37.720
stolen from SEL4. I should have updated this slide. We have a birds of a feather and a

12:37.720 --> 12:42.680
couple of hours for HAIR, the programming language. So it's not about Helios, it's about the language

12:42.680 --> 12:46.000
that Helios is implemented in. So if you want to learn more about the language, please come

12:46.000 --> 12:50.560
there. There's also a talk tomorrow in the microkernel room where I'm going to have a

12:50.560 --> 12:54.440
full hour to talk about Helios and I'll go into a lot more depth. So you're welcome to

12:54.440 --> 12:59.240
come check that out. If you want to see any resources online about the system, the links

12:59.240 --> 13:04.480
are here. This is a link to the website which contains mostly documentation, a link to the

13:04.480 --> 13:09.240
source code, to the website for the programming language and to the IRC channel where we hang

13:09.240 --> 13:21.400
out and we'll answer your questions. And that's it. That's Helios. Thank you very much.
