1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:08.220
So, my name is Boris Baldassari.

2
0:00:08.220 --> 0:00:12.600
I work for the Eclipse Foundation as an open source consultant and I'd like to introduce

3
0:00:12.600 --> 0:00:18.880
the OSPO Alliance and the work we are doing on the Good Governance Initiative.

4
0:00:18.880 --> 0:00:23.440
So, to start with, what is an OSPO?

5
0:00:23.440 --> 0:00:30.680
OSPO stands for Open Source Program Office and it's a team within an organization that

6
0:00:30.680 --> 0:00:34.440
takes care of everything open source within the organization.

7
0:00:34.440 --> 0:00:39.640
So, it's supposed to be a single point of contact for any question people may have about

8
0:00:39.640 --> 0:00:42.480
open source licensing and so on.

9
0:00:42.480 --> 0:00:47.720
The OSPO is supposed to foster the awareness of open source within the organization, define

10
0:00:47.720 --> 0:00:55.400
and implement a strategy regarding open source for the organization, inbound, outbound and

11
0:00:55.400 --> 0:00:57.600
much more than that.

12
0:00:57.600 --> 0:01:06.840
So, the idea is to make sure that the organization make a good use of the open source they consume,

13
0:01:06.840 --> 0:01:09.600
produce and so on.

14
0:01:09.600 --> 0:01:14.800
It also includes things about the ecosystem, the open source ecosystem and the participation

15
0:01:14.800 --> 0:01:19.760
into the ecosystem, the open source ecosystem by the organization.

16
0:01:19.760 --> 0:01:26.160
It should be noted that it has many impacts on many domains, so it's from the legal to

17
0:01:26.160 --> 0:01:34.560
the technical to the security, dependencies, development practices and so on.

18
0:01:34.560 --> 0:01:42.800
It's a strong recent trend, so many organizations nowadays are in the process of setting up

19
0:01:42.800 --> 0:01:44.960
an OSPO.

20
0:01:44.960 --> 0:01:49.360
When I talk about organizations, I talk about any type of organization, so these could be

21
0:01:49.360 --> 0:01:56.980
corporations, SMEs, administrations, universities, NGOs and so on.

22
0:01:56.980 --> 0:02:02.760
The point with these organizations is that quite often they don't know anything about

23
0:02:02.760 --> 0:02:08.760
open source, it's not in their culture, so they just don't know where to start.

24
0:02:08.760 --> 0:02:13.560
That's where the OSPO Alliance comes into the picture.

25
0:02:13.560 --> 0:02:20.600
The OSPO Alliance was launched in 2021 by a group of four European nonprofit organizations

26
0:02:20.600 --> 0:02:26.200
and the idea is to promote an approach to excellence in open source software management.

27
0:02:26.200 --> 0:02:34.440
We wanted it to be really easy to access, low barrier, there is no fee, there is no

28
0:02:34.440 --> 0:02:39.760
fee, the only thing we ask is a letter of support, a statement of support from the organization

29
0:02:39.760 --> 0:02:43.480
to the principals of open source and the OSPO Alliance.

30
0:02:43.480 --> 0:02:50.280
All our activity is open, public and freely accessible, no need to register to get access

31
0:02:50.280 --> 0:02:53.780
to what we do our outcomes.

32
0:02:53.780 --> 0:02:59.960
We are entirely governed by open source principles, so you can just come, join us, collaborate

33
0:02:59.960 --> 0:03:07.480
and if you are an active contributor then you will become a mentor and so on.

34
0:03:07.480 --> 0:03:14.360
Once again it's for all types and sizes of organizations.

35
0:03:14.360 --> 0:03:23.880
Our mission is twofold, firstly help the organizations make sure that they better use the open source

36
0:03:23.880 --> 0:03:32.880
software and ecosystem and properly take care of open source and also make them good citizens

37
0:03:32.880 --> 0:03:35.320
of the open source ecosystem.

38
0:03:35.320 --> 0:03:41.960
Not only consuming and producing but also participating and financing and being there

39
0:03:41.960 --> 0:03:48.560
and openly asserting their use of open source, so things like that.

40
0:03:48.560 --> 0:03:57.040
To assure this goals we have set up different sub-task forces, the first and the most visible

41
0:03:57.040 --> 0:04:03.640
one is the Good Governance Initiative Handbook which is a blueprint to help organizations

42
0:04:03.640 --> 0:04:06.960
define and build their OSPO.

43
0:04:06.960 --> 0:04:13.320
We also provide a safe place to exchange information so people can ask any type of question when

44
0:04:13.320 --> 0:04:18.920
they are trying to replace some proprietary software by an open source alternative they

45
0:04:18.920 --> 0:04:22.880
can ask for what others did.

46
0:04:22.880 --> 0:04:29.600
We have mailing lists, meetings, regular meetings, we participate to events and we also have

47
0:04:29.600 --> 0:04:36.600
a monthly session which is called the OSPO UNRAMP sessions where some of our members

48
0:04:36.600 --> 0:04:45.320
present how they did with their OSPO and share their good practices, their mistakes too.

49
0:04:45.320 --> 0:04:54.320
And we also have a task force for evangelism and dissemination of our initiative.

50
0:04:54.320 --> 0:05:00.560
So the Good Governance Handbook as I said is a blueprint to help organizations define,

51
0:05:00.560 --> 0:05:08.960
so build a roadmap and actually build their OSPO and make it a success.

52
0:05:08.960 --> 0:05:15.080
For that we propose 25 activities which are good practices that you want to implement

53
0:05:15.080 --> 0:05:20.000
when you build your OSPO and when you want to grow the open source awareness within your

54
0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:22.040
organization.

55
0:05:22.040 --> 0:05:28.160
These 25 activities are organized into five goals which are kind of levels of maturity,

56
0:05:28.160 --> 0:05:35.200
so the first one will be identify the open source you use and identify the skills that

57
0:05:35.200 --> 0:05:43.280
you have, start changing your contracts with your employees so they can actually contribute,

58
0:05:43.280 --> 0:05:50.920
set up or educate the legal team, educate the executives, contribute back, contribute

59
0:05:50.920 --> 0:05:56.120
upstream, assert publicly your use of open source and so on.

60
0:05:56.120 --> 0:06:04.240
We also provide the methods to implement these 25 activities so we recommend an agile and

61
0:06:04.240 --> 0:06:11.120
agile-like process where you will pick a few activities, complete them, select a few other

62
0:06:11.120 --> 0:06:15.560
activities and so on until you have completed the scope.

63
0:06:15.560 --> 0:06:23.040
And we had quite some success, so the first edition of our end book was in 2021.

64
0:06:23.040 --> 0:06:30.200
Last year we did an update, the 1.1 version and we also have translations, so German and

65
0:06:30.200 --> 0:06:36.200
French are already available and a few others are on their way, so Portuguese, Spanish,

66
0:06:36.200 --> 0:06:41.720
Italian, and whatever your language is, please join us, we use Weblades and we of course

67
0:06:41.720 --> 0:06:45.160
welcome contributors.

68
0:06:45.160 --> 0:06:53.360
So talking about the activities, they have really a wide range and scope, so it's from,

69
0:06:53.360 --> 0:06:58.160
as I said, identifying the open source you use, doing software composition analysis,

70
0:06:58.160 --> 0:07:03.320
dependency management, vulnerability management, it's also about implementing the good practices

71
0:07:03.320 --> 0:07:09.480
that we use in open source, so setting up peer reviews and things like that.

72
0:07:09.480 --> 0:07:16.360
Understanding the people, each air, so the contract allowing people to contribute, funding

73
0:07:16.360 --> 0:07:21.760
the ecosystem, the project that you use, and the foundation and the organization that make

74
0:07:21.760 --> 0:07:25.880
the open source ecosystem.

75
0:07:25.880 --> 0:07:33.440
Up to executive education and potentially making open source strategic asset for your

76
0:07:33.440 --> 0:07:34.720
organization.

77
0:07:34.720 --> 0:07:41.040
Each activity has the same structure, so we have a description that states what this activity

78
0:07:41.040 --> 0:07:46.760
is about, opportunity assessments, why would you implement this activity, what it will

79
0:07:46.760 --> 0:07:53.880
bring to you, progress assessment so you know where you are and that enables to track your

80
0:07:53.880 --> 0:08:00.880
progress and know when you can say that it's a complete activity and you can switch to

81
0:08:00.880 --> 0:08:02.880
the next.

82
0:08:02.880 --> 0:08:09.120
So feedback from the field, experienced people saying well you might have a look at this

83
0:08:09.120 --> 0:08:16.480
that will help and also some tools and recommendations and resources that you might find useful.

84
0:08:16.480 --> 0:08:23.640
As I said, the good governance initiative is for any type of organizations, so there

85
0:08:23.640 --> 0:08:28.240
are activities that will not fit within your organization.

86
0:08:28.240 --> 0:08:32.300
The first thing that you will do actually when you will implement the handbook is look

87
0:08:32.300 --> 0:08:38.440
at all the activities and select the one that you want or reject the one that do not apply

88
0:08:38.440 --> 0:08:40.840
to your context, that's okay.

89
0:08:40.840 --> 0:08:46.160
And from there the activities are kind of generic, so what you want to do from there

90
0:08:46.160 --> 0:08:53.720
is for each activity create a scorecard which will be the local adaptation of the activity

91
0:08:53.720 --> 0:08:56.000
to your own organization.

92
0:08:56.000 --> 0:09:03.280
So that will imply stating the teams, the internal teams that you may reach out to,

93
0:09:03.280 --> 0:09:09.280
the competencies, skills that you may need, the processes, tools and resources that you

94
0:09:09.280 --> 0:09:15.440
can use and that you will have to deal with and also identify some specific tasks that

95
0:09:15.440 --> 0:09:22.240
are relevant to your context and that this task will help you track your progress on

96
0:09:22.240 --> 0:09:24.120
the scorecard.

97
0:09:24.120 --> 0:09:28.560
We provide the scorecards in two versions, one is the PDF that you can simply print and

98
0:09:28.560 --> 0:09:35.040
fill in with paper and pen, good old style, and also a digital one.

99
0:09:35.040 --> 0:09:41.880
So last year when we did the 1.1 version of the handbook, we introduced a new feature

100
0:09:41.880 --> 0:09:46.120
which is the deployable GGI program.

101
0:09:46.120 --> 0:09:54.920
So basically it's a GitLab project that you clone in your own GitLab or in any GitLab

102
0:09:54.920 --> 0:10:00.640
and from there there will be a bunch of scripts that will be executed, create 25 activities

103
0:10:00.640 --> 0:10:07.280
as GitLab issues, so create a board so you can visualize them, you can click on an issue

104
0:10:07.280 --> 0:10:11.440
and see the description, opportunity assessment and so on.

105
0:10:11.440 --> 0:10:20.880
From there you can edit the description to fill in your own scorecard and once you have

106
0:10:20.880 --> 0:10:25.280
that so you have all your issues, you can visualize them in the board, you have defined

107
0:10:25.280 --> 0:10:28.520
your scorecard, so you can just start working on them.

108
0:10:28.520 --> 0:10:34.560
So you select a few of them, you work on them, you complete them, you select a few other

109
0:10:34.560 --> 0:10:41.400
ones and so on and each and every time, so it's a nightly script actually, but the GGI

110
0:10:41.400 --> 0:10:49.000
will create a GitLab pages, a static website that will reflect where you are, what are

111
0:10:49.000 --> 0:10:58.600
your current activities, your past activities and will even provide a simple dashboard.

112
0:10:58.600 --> 0:11:06.920
So the list of activities when you have implemented the myGGI looks like that and the simple dashboard

113
0:11:06.920 --> 0:11:11.280
that you get in static website looks like that so you have the full description of the

114
0:11:11.280 --> 0:11:15.680
activities that you are working on and also the scorecard.

115
0:11:15.680 --> 0:11:23.960
So it really tracks your own adaptation and implementation of the GGI program.

116
0:11:23.960 --> 0:11:25.400
So that's all.

117
0:11:25.400 --> 0:11:34.560
Once again we are an open source initiative so you can access all our resources for free,

118
0:11:34.560 --> 0:11:40.040
not even need to register whatsoever, you go to our website ospo-alliance.org, from

119
0:11:40.040 --> 0:11:45.960
there you can download the Good Governance Handbook, there is an HTML version, you get

120
0:11:45.960 --> 0:11:52.160
access to all the translations that are available and there is also a section about contributing,

121
0:11:52.160 --> 0:11:59.680
you can just simply join our calls, we have weekly calls and you just connect, everything

122
0:11:59.680 --> 0:12:04.800
is there.

123
0:12:04.800 --> 0:12:11.800
So we are European based because our contributors are Europeans so it's really based on the

124
0:12:11.800 --> 0:12:17.320
European values and way of doing things and so on but we are open to absolutely everyone.

125
0:12:17.320 --> 0:12:23.680
So just come, join us, you can help on the translations, on the updates of the handbook,

126
0:12:23.680 --> 0:12:28.800
on the dissemination and if you want to follow us it's here.

127
0:12:28.800 --> 0:12:29.840
And that's it.

128
0:12:29.840 --> 0:12:30.840
Thank you.

129
0:12:30.840 --> 0:12:36.720
Thank you very much.
