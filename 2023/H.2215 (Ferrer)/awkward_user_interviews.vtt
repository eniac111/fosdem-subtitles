WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.240
All right, everyone. Thank you. We have Emily O'Meer for the next talk, and she'll be doing

00:15.240 --> 00:20.600
her talk on do more awkward interview, more awkward user interviews. Do you feel awkward

00:20.600 --> 00:25.000
interviewing users about how they use your project? That's okay. Awkward interviews are

00:25.000 --> 00:32.080
often good interviews. I'll hand it over to Emily. Okay, excellent. Can everyone hear

00:32.080 --> 00:40.760
me? Cool. Okay, so how many of you feel really awkward when you do a user interview? Yes,

00:40.760 --> 00:45.520
okay. How many of you are really excited to learn about how you can make your user interviews

00:45.520 --> 00:52.080
even more awkward so you can feel... Okay, cool. That's what we're all here for. So I'm

00:52.080 --> 01:00.000
talking about two things basically that you should, A, do more user interviews regardless

01:00.000 --> 01:05.040
of how awkward you feel about them or not, and also that you should proactively employ

01:05.040 --> 01:09.920
techniques to make yourself feel more awkward, possibly also to make your interviewees feel

01:09.920 --> 01:14.360
a little bit more awkward, too. So I hope this sounds really awesome, and thank you

01:14.360 --> 01:20.320
all for joining me. The first thing that I... The first point that I want to make about

01:20.320 --> 01:26.280
doing user interviews and feeling awkward because a lot of people actually really hesitate

01:26.280 --> 01:29.960
to ask users in the first place because they feel like this is a huge ask. I'm going to

01:29.960 --> 01:34.260
ask literally like 30 minutes of somebody's time so they can feel really awkward just

01:34.260 --> 01:40.000
about that part. So remember though that this isn't actually how your user thinks about

01:40.000 --> 01:45.460
it. Doing a user interview, as in from the user's perspective, is actually a way for

01:45.460 --> 01:50.280
them to contribute to your project. It's a way for them to tell you what works, what

01:50.280 --> 01:56.440
doesn't, help you make the project better, and also people like to talk about themselves.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.640
You're giving the user an opportunity to talk about themselves, and from their perspective,

02:02.640 --> 02:07.040
hopefully get some of their needs met. They can give you their wish list. That doesn't

02:07.040 --> 02:12.000
mean you have to do everything on the wish list, but there is something in it for the

02:12.000 --> 02:17.440
user. So don't get too hung up on that first ask and feel like this is a huge imposition

02:17.440 --> 02:25.600
on your user. Okay. So then let's talk about a little bit why you need these user interviews.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.440
You need to be able to understand who your users are. You need to understand why they're

02:31.440 --> 02:37.440
using your product or your project, why they care about it. You need to understand that

02:37.440 --> 02:41.720
in order to figure out how you're going to talk about your project and also figure out

02:41.720 --> 02:47.000
what you're going to do with your project next. What components of your project, what

02:47.000 --> 02:52.200
features are really useful to people, what things people really don't care about, what

02:52.200 --> 02:56.640
things would actually be helpful if they were added, what things potentially could actually

02:56.640 --> 03:00.880
detract from the value of your product if you were to build them. So user interviews

03:00.880 --> 03:05.760
are really important. They're also a really important part of building community. Again,

03:05.760 --> 03:09.600
something to keep in mind when you're feeling really awkward about asking for that user

03:09.600 --> 03:14.440
interview, it's a way for your users to feel more connected to you as a maintainer and

03:14.440 --> 03:21.640
more connected to the community. So user interviews, super important to do in the first place.

03:21.640 --> 03:26.400
And this is some of the information that I hope that everyone thinks of when they're

03:26.400 --> 03:31.800
doing their user interviews. Just an example of things that you're going to try to be getting

03:31.800 --> 03:36.400
extracting out of your users as you're doing these interviews. You want to know what triggered

03:36.400 --> 03:42.000
them to find your project. So did they hear about it at a conference like Fostem? If so,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.120
and you want more people to find out about your project, maybe you should go to more

03:47.120 --> 03:52.520
conferences. But you also want to know what triggered them to even look for something

03:52.520 --> 03:58.680
like your project in the first place. What were they trying to accomplish in that moment?

03:58.680 --> 04:03.280
Then you also want to know what do they compare your project to in their head. And sometimes

04:03.280 --> 04:08.840
you'll find answers like some other project, and it will be obvious. But oftentimes people

04:08.840 --> 04:14.040
don't actually compare a project to another project. They compare a project to spending

04:14.040 --> 04:20.100
four hours a month doing something manually. They might compare a project to paying a fine.

04:20.100 --> 04:25.240
They might compare a project to losing sleep at night because they are worried about whatever

04:25.240 --> 04:31.240
it is that your project solves. So understanding what that mental comparison is is going to

04:31.240 --> 04:36.040
help you talk about your project more effectively, understand where your project needs to go

04:36.040 --> 04:41.080
in the future, and make more of a connection with your community.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.880
So another thing that you need to understand is how they interact with your project. Is

04:44.880 --> 04:49.880
this something that they actually touch every day, every week? Or is it something that runs

04:49.880 --> 04:54.920
in the background and is really critical but it's very easy for everybody to forget? Especially

04:54.920 --> 05:00.720
if you have a project that's used in a team situation, you want to know who on the team

05:00.720 --> 05:06.000
is interacting with the project and in what way. You'd also want to know who was the champion.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.920
So maybe you have five people on the team who are interacting with your project. Who

05:09.920 --> 05:14.760
was the champion? How did they then evangelize it within that team?

05:14.760 --> 05:21.920
And then you also want to know if, hopefully there was one, but if there was a magic moment,

05:21.920 --> 05:26.600
what that moment was. So when they first started using your project, what was the sort of a-ha

05:26.600 --> 05:33.600
moment when they were like, oh, now I understand how this is working. This is so awesome. And

05:33.600 --> 05:38.600
the understanding what that moment is, is really important so that you know what to

05:38.600 --> 05:45.600
optimize and how to make the process for a new user of getting to that magic moment as

05:45.600 --> 05:47.480
smooth as possible.

05:47.480 --> 05:54.440
All right. So let's talk some more about goals, right? Okay. So what's your goal when you're

05:54.440 --> 05:58.160
doing a user interview? I've just talked about some of these things. This is a pop quiz.

05:58.160 --> 06:04.280
Is it to get some really amazing information about your project or is it to make yourself

06:04.280 --> 06:14.040
look awesome and smart? Which? Okay. So there is a little bit of a caveat here. You don't

06:14.040 --> 06:18.860
want to make yourself look like a total moron, especially, you know, people are trusting

06:18.860 --> 06:22.600
you so you don't want them, like, if they're using your project, you don't want them to

06:22.600 --> 06:27.080
think you're a total moron, especially if you're, like, trying to monetize this project

06:27.080 --> 06:33.280
in any way, in any way, depending on it financially. However, you also don't want to get hung up

06:33.280 --> 06:37.680
on the idea of making yourself look good during this interview. That is not the point of a

06:37.680 --> 06:43.960
user interview. The point is to get some really good information. So some of these techniques,

06:43.960 --> 06:48.160
these interview techniques are from journalism. I used to be a journalist. When you're a journalist,

06:48.160 --> 06:51.720
you don't really care what your sources think of you. If they think you're an idiot, that's

06:51.720 --> 06:57.200
okay. So just to acknowledge, there are some limits. But then again, you know, your users

06:57.200 --> 07:02.720
are coming into this, they already respect you, they know your work as a maintainer,

07:02.720 --> 07:08.200
they depend and they like your project. So you don't need to show them how awesome you

07:08.200 --> 07:16.400
are. They already know that. Okay. So here are the two, like, awkward interview techniques

07:16.400 --> 07:22.400
that I want people to take away from this. So one is to strategically deploy awkward

07:22.400 --> 07:28.900
silences. The second one is to ask so many follow-up questions you risk looking dumb.

07:28.900 --> 07:38.280
But let's talk about the first one, the awkward silences. Okay. So in Western cultures, most

07:38.280 --> 07:43.440
cultures, it is a little bit culture-bound, but after a certain amount of time in a conversation,

07:43.440 --> 07:49.840
people start to feel like this silence is really awkward. And if you're in a conversation,

07:49.840 --> 07:54.480
that's really easy. You just ask the other person another question, boom, problem solved.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.920
But if this is an interview and one person is asking questions and the other person is

07:58.920 --> 08:06.960
answering them, and the interviewee has finished answering their question, and the interviewer

08:06.960 --> 08:13.520
doesn't do anything and just sits there and is silent, it's going to make the interviewee

08:13.520 --> 08:18.560
start talking again. And what happens is that first answer that you get to the question

08:18.560 --> 08:25.880
is like the pre-planned canned answer that they've already sort of mentally vetted to

08:25.880 --> 08:30.560
make themselves look good, possibly to make their organization look good and not reveal

08:30.560 --> 08:34.520
anything that's too embarrassing. That's good. I mean, you're going to get some good information

08:34.520 --> 08:39.720
there, but if you want to get beyond that, then after that person has finished answering

08:39.720 --> 08:51.120
the question, just let it sit and let it feel a little bit awkward. And if you can stand,

08:51.120 --> 08:56.800
if you can sit with that awkward silence long enough, the interviewee will start talking

08:56.800 --> 09:02.480
again. And when he or she starts talking again, that's where you get the information that

09:02.480 --> 09:07.120
they haven't really pre-vetted with themselves. They'll start rambling. You'll get the sort

09:07.120 --> 09:15.240
of like more emotional, more off the cuff answers to questions like, why did this matter?

09:15.240 --> 09:20.760
Or why did you want to do that? Even if you were to interview somebody about what they

09:20.760 --> 09:26.140
had for breakfast, I can guarantee you that if you just let an awkward silence sit there,

09:26.140 --> 09:30.600
they would start rambling on about why they chose whatever they had for breakfast because

09:30.600 --> 09:41.240
they feel like they need to fill that awkward silence. So the next thing, the next technique

09:41.240 --> 09:47.840
is follow-up questions. Let's use the breakfast example again. So you ask somebody, what did

09:47.840 --> 09:55.560
you have for breakfast? And they said, I had a croissant. And then you ask them why. Then

09:55.560 --> 09:59.040
you're going to start getting some more information. And then maybe they say, you know, that's

09:59.040 --> 10:04.880
all that was available. And then you ask them why. And you keep asking why again. This can

10:04.880 --> 10:09.040
start to feel a little bit uncomfortable because you're really pressing people to talk about

10:09.040 --> 10:17.360
their core motivation. But you're also getting information that is much deeper, much richer.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.760
And one of the tricks here and the thing that can honestly make you risk looking like an

10:22.760 --> 10:27.720
idiot is that you want to try not to assume anything. And particularly, this can be hard

10:27.720 --> 10:34.080
in a technical situation because there are some times when you want to show that you're

10:34.080 --> 10:39.440
not an idiot, you know why this was important. When somebody is like, we felt like we had

10:39.440 --> 10:46.000
to improve our supply chain security. And you ask why. It's like, well, isn't it obvious

10:46.000 --> 10:51.600
why we had to do that? But actually, it's not because why at that moment was that suddenly

10:51.600 --> 10:58.320
a priority. Why hadn't you done it before? So keep asking those why questions to try

10:58.320 --> 11:04.720
to dive into really understanding what the motivation is and not assuming anything. Even

11:04.720 --> 11:10.880
if it seems like, you know, it should be self-evident what the answer is, don't make that assumption.

11:10.880 --> 11:21.040
All right. So I am going to give you some homework. This homework is really easy. Choose

11:21.040 --> 11:27.400
a friend or a colleague and ask them to do an interview with you. It can be about anything.

11:27.400 --> 11:32.720
It can be what they did yesterday evening, what they had for breakfast. And I want you

11:32.720 --> 11:40.920
to try and see what happens when you don't jump in with a new question and just let that

11:40.920 --> 11:46.320
awkward silence hang. The key to doing this is that you have to set the expectations that

11:46.320 --> 11:51.440
this is an interview. So the other person is not allowed to ask you a question in return.

11:51.440 --> 11:57.080
They're only allowed to answer the questions that you're asking them. And the reason that

11:57.080 --> 12:02.720
I actually recommend practicing this is because it is way harder than you expect. It should

12:02.720 --> 12:08.920
be really easy, right? You're just sitting there quietly. But it goes against, like,

12:08.920 --> 12:16.480
your whole being to just let that silence sit there for as long as you can possibly

12:16.480 --> 12:26.760
stand. And that is why it works, quite honestly. Okay. So that's it. I'm Emily O'Meer. You

12:26.760 --> 12:31.600
can I have a podcast. It's called the business of open source. You can connect with me on

12:31.600 --> 12:37.240
my website. You can write me an email. I'm also on LinkedIn. You can send me a message

12:37.240 --> 12:40.360
on LinkedIn. You can just search for my name and you will find me. I don't think there's

12:40.360 --> 12:45.760
anyone else with my name. Before we wrap up, though, is there anybody who has questions?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.600
Yes.

12:47.600 --> 12:53.600
Do I need a microphone for this? Or is it more effective to do this with a microphone

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
or?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
Just ask the question and I'll repeat it.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.920
Is it more effective to do this with a microphone?

12:59.920 --> 13:01.920
Oh, is that the question?

13:01.920 --> 13:11.920
You mean if you're doing a user interview? I mean, honestly, when I do interviews, I

13:11.920 --> 13:19.640
use Zoom. So I just use whatever's on my computer. But no, it doesn't matter. This is a situation

13:19.640 --> 13:26.400
where technology just doesn't matter. Whatever, however you do an interview doesn't matter.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.760
On the other hand, I will say I understand where the question's coming from because people

13:30.760 --> 13:36.520
do behave differently when you put a microphone in front of their face. So if anything, no,

13:36.520 --> 13:45.080
do not put a microphone in front of people's face because that triggers the self-sensor.

13:45.080 --> 13:49.080
And what you want is to get rid of the self-sensor. Yes?

13:49.080 --> 14:01.080
So you said that people shouldn't ask a question of you during this interview. One way information.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Yep.

14:02.080 --> 14:07.160
If they do ask a question, do you stay silent to increase your view?

14:07.160 --> 14:14.120
So the question is if the interviewee asks you a question, should you just stay silent

14:14.120 --> 14:21.760
to increase the awkwardness? That's a really good question. I'm not sure. That's actually

14:21.760 --> 14:29.840
never happened to me. So I don't really have a good... I think I would go for just answering

14:29.840 --> 14:34.080
the question and then asking a follow-up.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.080
So you're...

14:35.080 --> 14:37.080
You could ask an answer question with a question.

14:37.080 --> 14:42.720
Yeah, you could do that too. So I think I would just... You want to use the two techniques

14:42.720 --> 14:47.080
together anyway. All right. We probably have time for one more question. Yes?

14:47.080 --> 14:53.280
Does being awkward ever break the interview or the trust and make it harder to go on?

14:53.280 --> 14:58.360
The question is does being awkward ever break the trust and make it even harder to go on?

14:58.360 --> 15:05.240
In my experience, no. I have never had a situation where being awkward broke the interviewee's

15:05.240 --> 15:12.240
trust. I don't think so. I mean, there's probably... There is a limit, right? But as long as you're

15:12.240 --> 15:20.440
being polite, then I wouldn't worry about that. And if you have any sense of social

15:20.440 --> 15:26.320
grace whatsoever, you will probably totally max out on your awkwardness well before you

15:26.320 --> 15:28.840
would break someone's trust.

15:28.840 --> 15:43.040
All right. Yeah. Okay. We have seven seconds. So thank you so much.
