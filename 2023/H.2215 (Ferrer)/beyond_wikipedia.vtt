00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Hi and welcome everyone.

00:08.880 --> 00:15.520
I'm here today to speak to you a little bit about Wiki Media's open source ecosystem.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.960
So I assume all of you know what Wikipedia is.

00:19.960 --> 00:26.460
And maybe some of you know that it runs on a software that is called MediaWiki.

00:26.460 --> 00:32.780
So all the wikis run on this software but there's also tens of thousands of websites

00:32.780 --> 00:34.480
around the world that use this.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.880
A very cool example is NASA is using it for some other projects.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.760
But this is sort of the core of Wikipedia and the other projects and it's of course

00:45.760 --> 00:49.720
something that is open source that anyone can contribute to.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.480
But it's not what I'm going to be talking about today.

00:53.480 --> 00:59.400
Because surrounding Wikipedia and all the other projects there is a huge ecosystem of

00:59.400 --> 01:01.400
software tools.

01:01.400 --> 01:07.640
You can think of these as like third party integrations.

01:07.640 --> 01:13.200
People build bots that do edits on Wikipedia that fight vandalism.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.680
There are machine learning algorithms.

01:15.680 --> 01:20.640
There are pipelines for data that then go to research purposes.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.320
There's a lot going on.

01:22.320 --> 01:28.600
So I'm going to be talking about this part.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.320
Just a quick word about me.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.280
I'm a software engineer with a technical engagement team.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.440
You can see we're part of the technology department.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.000
And our team is kind of split into parts.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.760
We have the cloud services team, SREs and engineers that build services and platforms

01:46.760 --> 01:49.800
for all these tool developers.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.080
Then we have developer advocacy.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.200
They do a lot of things.

01:52.200 --> 01:58.320
They are writing documents and running outreach programs.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.760
And doing everything so that our technical contributors can build cool stuff on top of

02:04.760 --> 02:10.400
our platforms and content.

02:10.400 --> 02:18.240
So just to give you an idea of the scale of this, we have over 300,000 editors that contribute

02:18.240 --> 02:22.040
to Wikimedia projects every month.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.680
Wikimedia Commons, which is the project that is for free media files, videos, images, so

02:27.680 --> 02:28.680
on.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.000
There are now over 90 million media files on there.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.480
And we have 1.7 billion unique devices that access Wikimedia against statistics for every

02:39.480 --> 02:42.600
month.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.640
So some of you may recognize at least some of these projects.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.680
Of course, Wikipedia is the flagship.

02:48.680 --> 02:53.640
There are other ones like Wikidata, Commons that we just mentioned, the dictionary, and

02:53.640 --> 02:58.120
many more.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.920
So yeah, we're going to take a look at these tools, ecosystems that I mentioned in the

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
beginning.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.240
And we're going to start from Wikipedia.

03:06.240 --> 03:11.880
This is the thing that most people know about us.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.000
And from there, we're going to explore the tools that are community created software

03:15.000 --> 03:20.160
that interacts with and contributes to Wikimedia project in some way.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.880
An example here is PyWikibot.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.620
It's a framework for building bots.

03:24.620 --> 03:29.680
So if you have a wiki and you want to run some kind of bot that does something, some

03:29.680 --> 03:37.880
type of edits, you would very likely use PyWikibot as a framework to develop this.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.720
And yeah.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.040
From the tools themselves, we're going to go and have a look at the services and the

03:45.040 --> 03:49.640
platforms that support them.

03:49.640 --> 03:56.720
And we're going to start with an example of a couple tools and how they actually integrate

03:56.720 --> 03:59.440
with one of the projects.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.480
So this is a wiki project called Women in Red.

04:03.480 --> 04:08.080
And a wiki project is a group of users from Wikipedia that decide that they want to work

04:08.080 --> 04:13.120
on something specific, they come together to work as a group.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.480
And in this case, it's to fight the content gender gap.

04:17.480 --> 04:24.440
So they observed that only around 15% of English Wikipedia biographies were about women.

04:24.440 --> 04:33.080
And as of the 23rd of January this year, they have managed to take this number up to around

04:33.080 --> 04:40.120
90.45% in about seven or eight years.

04:40.120 --> 04:44.160
And so where does this very precise statistic come from?

04:44.160 --> 04:49.840
You can see mentioned here and in red it's something called human nicking.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.000
And so this is what we would call a tool.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.960
And in this case, this is a dashboard.

04:53.960 --> 04:59.920
It provides statistics about the gender gap on all the Wikimedia projects.

04:59.920 --> 05:07.120
And you can see here that female content is the orange part and then the rest is male.

05:07.120 --> 05:13.280
And if you go to this website, you can see it in a more granular way by country, by project,

05:13.280 --> 05:25.240
by date of birth and so on.

05:25.240 --> 05:31.300
So if you want to contribute to this project, an easy way to do it is to go to this Wiki

05:31.300 --> 05:34.680
Project site and you can see different lists that have been curated.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.840
For instance, here we can see female activists.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.760
So you can get a list of all the female activists.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.600
And there are many, many categories like this.

05:45.600 --> 05:52.040
And some of these lists are curated by humans, but most of these lists actually come from

05:52.040 --> 05:59.440
a bot that's called a Stereobol, which makes queries on Wikidata, which is another one

05:59.440 --> 06:00.440
of the projects.

06:00.440 --> 06:06.920
You can think of it like a huge knowledge graph that you can query using a similar language

06:06.920 --> 06:08.880
to SQL.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.680
It's called Sparkle.

06:10.680 --> 06:17.920
So you can use Wikidata to get lists with very high granularity.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.880
You can have activists from Germany or activists from Germany that were born after a certain

06:22.880 --> 06:24.600
date.

06:24.600 --> 06:30.720
And so this is what the Stereobol does.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.440
So we have seen two different tools.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.920
One was a dashboard, one was a bot.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.480
And there are thousands of these tools.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.880
There are thousands of maintainers.

06:40.880 --> 06:48.320
And we're going to take a look at how we sustain these people.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.200
So I mentioned that my team is the cloud services team.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.320
And what we do is we provide hosting.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.080
We provide compute, virtual machines.

06:58.080 --> 07:03.240
We provide data services for all these tools to function.

07:03.240 --> 07:08.320
So again, to give you an idea of the scale of this, 30% of all the edits on Wikipedia

07:08.320 --> 07:13.240
as of 2020 were made by bots hosted on our services.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.520
For Wikidata, that number is a little bit higher.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.280
It's around 50%.

07:19.280 --> 07:27.680
So just to make you aware that this is a quite important part of the ecosystem.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.200
So I mentioned there are thousands of tools.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.160
And as of a couple years ago, we now have a catalog where you can browse and search

07:37.160 --> 07:39.120
and find a tool you need for your project.

07:39.120 --> 07:45.200
Or if you are a tool maintainer, you can add it here so that people know it exists.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.280
Then what you see here are lists that have been curated.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.840
We have something called a Coolest Tool Award.

07:51.840 --> 08:03.080
If you look down, you can see that Humanike was one of the award-winning tools in 2021.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.040
Some of you may recognize this as a Jupyter notebook.

08:06.040 --> 08:12.320
So this is a Jupyter hub deployment that we have that is directly integrated with all

08:12.320 --> 08:18.120
of our data services so that people can access dumps, they can access Wiki Replicas, they

08:18.120 --> 08:24.920
can access a lot of things that otherwise would be gigabyte and gigabyte and gigabyte

08:24.920 --> 08:32.280
of data they would have to download onto their own computers.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.200
A similar tool is called Quarry.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.280
It's a public query interface for Wiki Replicas.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.960
Wiki Replicas, I didn't mention it.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.800
There are replicas of our production databases.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.760
And the cool thing about this is that all the queries are public.

08:49.760 --> 08:55.720
So people can actually search and see other people's queries and be inspired.

08:55.720 --> 09:01.720
Or if you're not very good with SQL, well, you can adapt someone's query to your needs.

09:01.720 --> 09:15.120
Here you can see a specific query.

09:15.120 --> 09:21.720
So these services are still kind of tools that serve this ecosystem, but we also need

09:21.720 --> 09:25.160
somewhere to host them.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.840
So we have a platform as a services offering.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.440
It's called Toolforge.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.880
It's not quite as fancy as Heroku or DigitalOcean or anything of this sort.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.840
If you look closely, you see that you have to actually SSH into it.

09:38.840 --> 09:43.240
But it's still very powerful and very convenient for our users.

09:43.240 --> 09:50.080
It integrates again with data sources and it has managed databases, a Redis instance,

09:50.080 --> 09:58.080
a Elasticsearch cluster that everyone can use without having to maintain all these systems

09:58.080 --> 10:00.360
themselves.

10:00.360 --> 10:05.160
So yeah, the back end here is Kubernetes.

10:05.160 --> 10:12.720
Then for more complicated projects, some projects need more compute, for instance.

10:12.720 --> 10:19.880
We also have a Cloud VPS offering so that people can spin up their own virtual machines

10:19.880 --> 10:23.440
and basically do what they want on them.

10:23.440 --> 10:32.000
So this runs on top of OpenStack.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.040
And how could one get involved with this?

10:36.040 --> 10:44.320
So it's possible to get involved in any of these layers, either as a tool maintainer

10:44.320 --> 10:49.840
or as maintainer of any of these platforms.

10:49.840 --> 10:55.320
And that's kind of the thing I wanted to highlight a little bit today, is that this is kind of

10:55.320 --> 11:07.520
a unique opportunity to actually contribute to platform and to infrastructure.

11:07.520 --> 11:16.000
We have people that work with our team and they are on our IRC channels and they push

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
patches just like everyone else.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.720
And if you don't know, you would think they are just another software engineer on the

11:21.720 --> 11:23.280
team.

11:23.280 --> 11:29.000
And I asked some of them, what brings you here?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.720
And of course, many of them associate with their free knowledge and free knowledge movement

11:33.720 --> 11:36.000
and open source and all of that.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.960
But many also said that this is a unique opportunity to actually play with things like OpenStack

11:41.960 --> 11:48.400
or Terraform or Kubernetes in a situation where actually you have real traffic and real

11:48.400 --> 11:53.120
users which is something that is kind of very difficult to do at home.

11:53.120 --> 12:01.040
And there are not many other projects where you would have this possibility.

12:01.040 --> 12:08.540
So some ways to get involved.

12:08.540 --> 12:11.300
We have several outreach programs.

12:11.300 --> 12:16.120
We have Outreachy which is an internship that runs twice a year.

12:16.120 --> 12:22.960
It's targeted more towards underrepresented demographic.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.000
Google Summer of Code, that's once a year.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.680
And both programs are open to anyone.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.320
So you don't have to be a student.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.720
You can be someone who is changing careers or doing some kind of a letter move.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.240
Google Summer of Code has also become more flexible.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.640
It's not just summer anymore.

12:42.640 --> 12:43.640
There are shorter projects.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.760
There are longer projects.

12:45.760 --> 12:54.920
So that could be a way to get involved and get some kind of hands-on mentorship.

12:54.920 --> 12:58.040
Another way would be to come to the Wikimedia Hackathons.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.120
We have one in Athens in May this year.

13:02.120 --> 13:07.880
And then one is part of Wikimedia that takes part in Singapore, that is in Singapore in

13:07.880 --> 13:10.640
August.

13:10.640 --> 13:15.960
And of course if you are brave you can just dive right in because everything we do is

13:15.960 --> 13:20.280
open and it's out there on the internet.

13:20.280 --> 13:27.400
Documentation of course but like just even our project boards and fabricator that's a

13:27.400 --> 13:32.320
collaborative software for task management and such.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.720
So if you go there you will see that there is a huge variety of tasks.

13:35.720 --> 13:40.160
You can see the work boards of different teams at the foundation.

13:40.160 --> 13:46.800
You can see volunteer led projects and projects where people work together alongside each

13:46.800 --> 13:48.840
other.

13:48.840 --> 13:55.720
So a way could be simply to find something that interests you and look at the documentation

13:55.720 --> 14:06.280
and then come on our IRC channels and contact us and that's it.

14:06.280 --> 14:13.760
So yeah I have added some links which can be helpful to get started.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.000
And you are of course free to just reach out to me.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.280
I had my Twitter handle on the first slide.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.480
My slides are published on the website.

14:23.480 --> 14:31.040
We have 45 seconds for questions.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
Thank you.

14:32.040 --> 14:37.160
Thank you Sabina.
