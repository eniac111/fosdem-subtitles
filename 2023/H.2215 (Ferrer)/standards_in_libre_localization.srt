1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
0:00:04.780 --> 0:00:06.780
Thank you.

3
0:00:09.360 --> 0:00:13.400
So, it's time. Okay. Hello, everyone. So we have here

4
0:00:13.400 --> 0:00:17.840
Benjamin Jamie who will be sharing should there be a

5
0:00:17.840 --> 0:00:21.340
standard and Libra localization. Ideas on how to make it easy

6
0:00:21.340 --> 0:00:23.440
for translators to contribute to any FOSS project they like.

7
0:00:23.440 --> 0:00:25.440
Thank you, Benjamin.

8
0:00:25.440 --> 0:00:27.440
Thank you.

9
0:00:29.440 --> 0:00:31.440
Thank you for the applause. I didn't deserve that yet.

10
0:00:34.440 --> 0:00:36.440
Definitely. Thank you for being in such a large count here.

11
0:00:40.440 --> 0:00:44.440
So, I'm Benjamin. I work in Weblade. I do the talking there.

12
0:00:44.440 --> 0:00:48.440
And you can also meet Michal in this lovely hoodie here.

13
0:00:51.440 --> 0:00:54.440
And he's the mind behind the coat and everything. And the

14
0:00:54.440 --> 0:00:56.440
founder.

15
0:00:58.440 --> 0:01:00.440
I won't be talking much about Weblade here. That's the talk

16
0:01:00.440 --> 0:01:04.440
tomorrow in translation's dev room. Here I would like to share

17
0:01:04.440 --> 0:01:07.440
a story and kick off something probably that could become a

18
0:01:07.440 --> 0:01:09.440
standard in Libra localization.

19
0:01:14.440 --> 0:01:16.440
Because at the moment, it's nothing like that there.

20
0:01:16.440 --> 0:01:20.440
At first, I would like to talk a short start of Weblade story.

21
0:01:20.440 --> 0:01:24.440
It doesn't start like a master minded start-up plan that will

22
0:01:24.440 --> 0:01:28.440
get a lot of money and conquer the world of the localization.

23
0:01:28.440 --> 0:01:31.440
No, that's other companies. We are Libra software from the

24
0:01:31.440 --> 0:01:35.440
start. And Michal actually started it when he was working

25
0:01:35.440 --> 0:01:41.440
at SUSE. And now SUSE people are very proud that they started

26
0:01:41.440 --> 0:01:47.440
it during the SUSE hack week 12 years ago. Sorry, 11 years ago.

27
0:01:47.440 --> 0:01:56.440
And for a long time, this is the office. It was actually the

28
0:01:56.440 --> 0:02:00.440
office at the top of the building of those large concrete

29
0:02:00.440 --> 0:02:04.440
buildings you have around the Czech Republic built in

30
0:02:04.440 --> 0:02:11.440
socialism. And when you needed an elevator there, there was

31
0:02:11.440 --> 0:02:15.440
those like small on some side of the building. And then you

32
0:02:15.440 --> 0:02:18.440
put all the machinery for your elevator. But it's not needed

33
0:02:18.440 --> 0:02:22.440
now. So all the machinery is downstairs in the shaft. And

34
0:02:22.440 --> 0:02:26.440
Michal had his office on the top of the building. And it's like

35
0:02:26.440 --> 0:02:29.440
three to four meters or something like that. And that's

36
0:02:29.440 --> 0:02:35.440
how he started it. And it was not aimed to do something that

37
0:02:35.440 --> 0:02:31.440
will be master minded and well-

38
0:02:31.440 --> 0:02:37.440
supported. And it was a very good idea to do that. And it

39
0:02:37.440 --> 0:02:42.440
was a very good idea to do that. And it was a very good idea to

40
0:02:42.440 --> 0:02:46.440
do that. And it was a very good idea to do that. And it was

41
0:02:46.440 --> 0:02:52.440
master minded and well-prepared for all the use cases. It was

42
0:02:52.440 --> 0:02:57.440
just in the start, the use case that Michal wanted something

43
0:02:57.440 --> 0:03:02.440
better than Puthu, which was very popular tool but no longer

44
0:03:02.440 --> 0:03:07.440
maintained. And something that's very tightly integrated with

45
0:03:07.440 --> 0:03:12.440
Puthu is that much of the money will work. And you are a

46
0:03:12.440 --> 0:03:16.440
developer. So you connect Weblight to your version control

47
0:03:16.440 --> 0:03:19.440
system and it just works. You don't have to care about

48
0:03:19.440 --> 0:03:22.440
anything. And then everything is in the editor. And you know

49
0:03:22.440 --> 0:03:27.440
localization editors from Weblight and from other similar

50
0:03:27.440 --> 0:03:33.440
tools. And then more and more big open source projects and

51
0:03:33.440 --> 0:03:38.440
other companies went to ask Michal, hey, we would like to use

52
0:03:38.440 --> 0:03:44.440
it. Can we pay you for supporting it? And yeah, that's

53
0:03:44.440 --> 0:03:50.440
how Weblight started getting bigger. And these days there

54
0:03:50.440 --> 0:03:57.440
are large or small Libra projects that are using Weblight.

55
0:03:57.440 --> 0:04:03.440
And oh, sorry, I forgot to put a pen pot logo there. We'll do

56
0:04:03.440 --> 0:04:10.440
tomorrow. But there is Kaledis. And more and more Libra

57
0:04:10.440 --> 0:04:16.440
projects started using it. And it became some sort of a go

58
0:04:16.440 --> 0:04:21.440
for tool. And then Fedora came, I think, three years back to

59
0:04:21.440 --> 0:04:26.440
us and migrated all their stuff from Xanata, from their

60
0:04:26.440 --> 0:04:31.440
original platform they created to Weblight because Xanata was

61
0:04:31.440 --> 0:04:34.440
like we don't have time for that. That's not our core of

62
0:04:34.440 --> 0:04:40.440
business. So we won't use Weblight. And that's how we

63
0:04:40.440 --> 0:04:44.440
realized that this is maybe the thing that will be happening

64
0:04:44.440 --> 0:04:51.440
more. And it became our responsibility. We took very

65
0:04:51.440 --> 0:04:56.440
seriously to give the tool to the communities that they can

66
0:04:56.440 --> 0:05:00.440
use happily and they can contribute to. But it's still

67
0:05:00.440 --> 0:05:05.440
just one platform. It's Weblight. And we created last

68
0:05:05.440 --> 0:05:10.440
year a page called Discover Weblight. So if you are on a

69
0:05:10.440 --> 0:05:14.440
hosted Weblight, if you have your projects on a hosted Weblight

70
0:05:14.440 --> 0:05:18.440
which is the largest instance of Weblight on the Internet, it's

71
0:05:18.440 --> 0:05:22.440
easier to search there. And it will be even easier throughout

72
0:05:22.440 --> 0:05:26.440
this year because of the development. And if you host

73
0:05:26.440 --> 0:05:36.440
yourself your instance, we wanted to give the users a place

74
0:05:36.440 --> 0:05:40.440
where they can come and search through all the Weblight

75
0:05:40.440 --> 0:05:45.440
instances that are open to contribute to this page. So at

76
0:05:45.440 --> 0:05:50.440
the end of the project, you can find if the project is using

77
0:05:50.440 --> 0:05:54.440
Weblight, you have this place and you can search for your

78
0:05:54.440 --> 0:05:58.440
project name, let's say, and you will be guided to the right

79
0:05:58.440 --> 0:06:02.440
place. And you can contribute to the localizations there. But

80
0:06:02.440 --> 0:06:06.440
what about if the project, because there are so many

81
0:06:06.440 --> 0:06:11.440
projects in the world that are not using Weblight yet or they

82
0:06:11.440 --> 0:06:15.440
are not using Weblight, it's always your choice. What do you

83
0:06:15.440 --> 0:06:29.440
use in your community? Sorry. So there became an idea. And I

84
0:06:29.440 --> 0:06:33.440
think two years back, and that's really important to say, the

85
0:06:33.440 --> 0:06:38.440
time frame, I was speaking with Dwayne. Dwayne is a wonderful

86
0:06:38.440 --> 0:06:42.440
guy who works with the Weblight. And he is a great developer

87
0:06:42.440 --> 0:06:47.440
to translate toolkit, which is one of the core components that

88
0:06:47.440 --> 0:06:53.440
Weblight uses to work with translation files. And Dwayne

89
0:06:53.440 --> 0:06:57.440
is, yeah, very talkative like I am. So we were talking a lot.

90
0:06:57.440 --> 0:07:04.440
And then I told him, yeah, and maybe there should be a way for

91
0:07:04.440 --> 0:07:08.440
like one place possibly federated,

92
0:07:08.440 --> 0:07:11.560
so it's not in one central place,

93
0:07:11.560 --> 0:07:16.400
where I as a translator of a Libra software,

94
0:07:16.400 --> 0:07:18.600
that's not technically savvy,

95
0:07:18.600 --> 0:07:20.560
and I want to contribute the time

96
0:07:20.560 --> 0:07:22.360
to the project of my choice,

97
0:07:22.360 --> 0:07:27.360
but I don't want to search through readme's and wikis

98
0:07:27.760 --> 0:07:32.540
because every project has its own different way,

99
0:07:32.540 --> 0:07:33.880
or there is no information,

100
0:07:33.880 --> 0:07:36.640
and you have to really dig hard to find it,

101
0:07:36.640 --> 0:07:38.840
or if you are at FOSDEM,

102
0:07:38.840 --> 0:07:41.240
you can walk around the booth

103
0:07:41.240 --> 0:07:45.680
and see a little bit like a little advertisement

104
0:07:45.680 --> 0:07:49.200
or small stand that says this project

105
0:07:49.200 --> 0:07:50.840
is localized on WebLite,

106
0:07:50.840 --> 0:07:54.920
but if you are in the online world,

107
0:07:54.920 --> 0:07:59.200
you will spend usually a lot of time to find

108
0:07:59.200 --> 0:08:00.320
where is the right place

109
0:08:00.320 --> 0:08:02.440
to localize your favorite software,

110
0:08:02.440 --> 0:08:04.280
and I told that to Dwayne,

111
0:08:04.280 --> 0:08:08.180
and Dwayne said, oh yeah, I had that idea a while before,

112
0:08:08.180 --> 0:08:13.080
and I have it very roughly specified,

113
0:08:13.080 --> 0:08:14.040
and we were talking more,

114
0:08:14.040 --> 0:08:18.220
and then he sent like nine pages long,

115
0:08:18.220 --> 0:08:22.980
nice specification of how it could look like

116
0:08:22.980 --> 0:08:24.200
and how it could work,

117
0:08:24.200 --> 0:08:25.960
and there are so many other features

118
0:08:25.960 --> 0:08:27.920
that we would like to have there,

119
0:08:27.920 --> 0:08:30.960
but that was two years ago,

120
0:08:30.960 --> 0:08:32.200
and nothing happened,

121
0:08:32.200 --> 0:08:37.200
because there is no time to do that

122
0:08:38.680 --> 0:08:40.960
in WebLite team,

123
0:08:40.960 --> 0:08:45.560
and it should be a community thing.

124
0:08:45.560 --> 0:08:49.560
It shouldn't be something that WebLite says,

125
0:08:49.560 --> 0:08:51.680
this is the thing, how you should do it,

126
0:08:51.680 --> 0:08:53.280
and everybody should use it.

127
0:08:53.280 --> 0:08:54.120
It can be like that,

128
0:08:54.120 --> 0:08:55.680
but we are at FOSDEM,

129
0:08:55.680 --> 0:08:59.280
there are so many wonderfully skilled people

130
0:08:59.280 --> 0:09:03.440
that may be interested in not only helping

131
0:09:03.440 --> 0:09:05.280
with the actual development,

132
0:09:05.280 --> 0:09:07.580
but also sharing their ideas,

133
0:09:07.580 --> 0:09:09.800
and maybe they,

134
0:09:09.800 --> 0:09:13.960
because it's such obvious thing that's missing,

135
0:09:13.960 --> 0:09:16.320
maybe there are so many people

136
0:09:16.320 --> 0:09:18.760
that already have similar ideas

137
0:09:18.760 --> 0:09:20.640
or some kind of specification,

138
0:09:20.640 --> 0:09:23.240
and I would like to use this talk

139
0:09:23.240 --> 0:09:26.360
if you have an idea,

140
0:09:26.360 --> 0:09:28.080
I just want to kick it off,

141
0:09:28.080 --> 0:09:30.200
we are not working on it yet,

142
0:09:30.200 --> 0:09:32.240
we just want to connect,

143
0:09:32.240 --> 0:09:33.800
we want to discuss,

144
0:09:33.800 --> 0:09:37.040
and maybe in a year on next FOSDEM,

145
0:09:37.040 --> 0:09:38.680
we will have something like that,

146
0:09:38.680 --> 0:09:43.000
and a lot of projects could use that,

147
0:09:43.000 --> 0:09:46.480
or every project on FOSDEM,

148
0:09:46.480 --> 0:09:50.240
and it shouldn't be just about WebLite,

149
0:09:50.240 --> 0:09:51.960
it should be maybe a file,

150
0:09:51.960 --> 0:09:56.520
like you have a license file in your repository,

151
0:09:56.520 --> 0:09:57.680
or a readme file,

152
0:09:57.680 --> 0:09:59.840
that can be indexed by some tool,

153
0:09:59.840 --> 0:10:04.400
so if I want to have an instance,

154
0:10:04.400 --> 0:10:06.640
a server where I could guide,

155
0:10:07.760 --> 0:10:09.760
let's say I'm a localization lab,

156
0:10:09.760 --> 0:10:12.720
or some other lovely group of people

157
0:10:12.720 --> 0:10:15.620
that wants to localize open source software,

158
0:10:15.620 --> 0:10:18.000
they can use some kind of tool,

159
0:10:18.000 --> 0:10:20.560
put it on their website on their own server,

160
0:10:20.560 --> 0:10:23.740
and tell if you have your time,

161
0:10:23.740 --> 0:10:26.320
select a language you want to contribute to,

162
0:10:26.320 --> 0:10:28.120
and find your project,

163
0:10:28.120 --> 0:10:33.120
and this might should index those readmes,

164
0:10:33.640 --> 0:10:35.620
or translation MD files,

165
0:10:35.620 --> 0:10:37.980
from not only GitHub and GitLab,

166
0:10:37.980 --> 0:10:40.840
but probably more and more.

167
0:10:42.840 --> 0:10:44.200
Can it be done?

168
0:10:44.200 --> 0:10:47.040
Probably yes, it will have some limits,

169
0:10:47.040 --> 0:10:50.160
it probably won't scan all the repositories in the world,

170
0:10:50.160 --> 0:10:51.200
that's not possible,

171
0:10:51.200 --> 0:10:54.920
but maybe we can make something bigger

172
0:10:54.920 --> 0:10:56.680
than Discover Web Light,

173
0:10:56.680 --> 0:11:01.480
that's universal use for everyone.

174
0:11:02.600 --> 0:11:07.600
What should it do is to guide the translator

175
0:11:07.960 --> 0:11:10.120
to the right platform, to the right place,

176
0:11:10.120 --> 0:11:13.140
because if I'm a translator,

177
0:11:13.140 --> 0:11:18.140
I don't know all the technical way of the localization,

178
0:11:19.200 --> 0:11:20.920
which can be made easier

179
0:11:20.920 --> 0:11:25.140
by localization management software like Web Light.

180
0:11:26.080 --> 0:11:29.920
I just want to translate my hello to hello,

181
0:11:29.920 --> 0:11:31.120
and that's it.

182
0:11:33.240 --> 0:11:36.560
It should be unified, so everybody can use it.

183
0:11:36.560 --> 0:11:39.820
It should be possible to index it somehow,

184
0:11:39.820 --> 0:11:41.640
to search through it,

185
0:11:41.640 --> 0:11:45.100
and yeah, that's a start,

186
0:11:45.100 --> 0:11:49.400
and probably there is much more that it should do it,

187
0:11:49.400 --> 0:11:52.240
but in a start, this would be nice.

188
0:11:52.240 --> 0:11:55.360
And yeah, let's discuss.

189
0:11:56.640 --> 0:11:58.600
If you go, not right now,

190
0:11:58.600 --> 0:12:01.720
because I have to add a link once I finish the talk,

191
0:12:01.720 --> 0:12:05.040
but this is the place where you can go

192
0:12:05.040 --> 0:12:08.820
and search through Web Light schedule.

193
0:12:09.880 --> 0:12:11.120
I just double check.

194
0:12:11.120 --> 0:12:14.560
Yeah, it's right, there is no misclick.

195
0:12:14.560 --> 0:12:17.800
So if you go there, you can see all the schedule,

196
0:12:17.800 --> 0:12:21.700
all the plans as Web Light have for this post-em,

197
0:12:21.700 --> 0:12:24.140
I will add their link to the discussion,

198
0:12:24.140 --> 0:12:28.560
and you can join, you can share it with your friends

199
0:12:28.560 --> 0:12:31.000
that are interested in such things,

200
0:12:31.000 --> 0:12:34.880
and maybe we will come up with something interesting

201
0:12:34.880 --> 0:12:39.880
for every possible translator in the Libre community,

202
0:12:40.760 --> 0:12:44.160
or in ideal way, this tool,

203
0:12:44.160 --> 0:12:46.600
or this localization file,

204
0:12:46.600 --> 0:12:50.200
or translation entity, whatever we will call it,

205
0:12:50.200 --> 0:12:55.200
can welcome new translators

206
0:12:56.180 --> 0:12:58.460
that don't feel I'm a translator

207
0:12:58.460 --> 0:13:02.720
and then don't know how to get there,

208
0:13:02.720 --> 0:13:06.240
maybe to make it easy for everyone.

209
0:13:06.240 --> 0:13:11.240
So that's it, that's what I wanted to share with you,

210
0:13:11.240 --> 0:13:16.240
and yeah, I'm interested in what do you think,

211
0:13:18.080 --> 0:13:20.520
maybe we still have three minutes

212
0:13:20.520 --> 0:13:22.200
so we can talk something.

213
0:13:22.200 --> 0:13:26.640
Right now, you can also, if you go to that link,

214
0:13:27.880 --> 0:13:31.620
you can also find our BO stickers, T-shirts,

215
0:13:31.620 --> 0:13:34.040
and yeah, other things,

216
0:13:34.040 --> 0:13:36.980
and you can share your ideas there about Web Light

217
0:13:36.980 --> 0:13:38.900
and what we should include,

218
0:13:38.900 --> 0:13:42.600
and if you don't like something, just come there and tell us,

219
0:13:42.600 --> 0:13:45.600
or you can join the online discussion

220
0:13:45.600 --> 0:13:48.840
that will be ready in a few minutes,

221
0:13:48.840 --> 0:13:52.080
and yeah, thank you for your attention,

222
0:13:52.080 --> 0:13:54.740
and if anybody has a question or anything,

223
0:13:54.740 --> 0:13:59.740
just raise your hand or come here and tell it to us.

224
0:13:59.880 --> 0:14:02.480
Thank you for your time, and enjoy your first time.

225
0:14:02.480 --> 0:14:09.480
Thank you.
