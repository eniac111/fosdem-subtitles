1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.000
And here we go.

2
0:00:06.000 --> 0:00:07.000
All right.

3
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:13.440
If we could all have a moment of discovering our desks.

4
0:00:13.440 --> 0:00:16.840
And without further ado, may we have a round of applause to welcome Johannes.

5
0:00:16.840 --> 0:00:17.840
Thank you.

6
0:00:17.840 --> 0:00:29.360
Yeah, thanks everybody for stopping by at the community, Debra, or for staying here.

7
0:00:29.360 --> 0:00:33.440
Glad to see so many of you.

8
0:00:33.440 --> 0:00:37.600
Maybe some of you have seen this morning my colleague, Lina's talk at the public code

9
0:00:37.600 --> 0:00:40.600
dev room about the PMPC campaign in Europe.

10
0:00:40.600 --> 0:00:48.640
So in my talk, I will focus more on the PMPC campaign and how you can get involved in it,

11
0:00:48.640 --> 0:00:53.880
what you can do with it at your local level, at your region, in your country.

12
0:00:53.880 --> 0:00:55.720
My name is Johannes Neder.

13
0:00:55.720 --> 0:00:58.600
I'm working for the Free Software Foundation Europe.

14
0:00:58.600 --> 0:01:03.240
And for those who don't know us, the Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that

15
0:01:03.240 --> 0:01:07.720
empowers people, users to control technology.

16
0:01:07.720 --> 0:01:13.800
As software is deeply involved in all our lives, it's important that it empowers us

17
0:01:13.800 --> 0:01:16.160
rather than restricting us.

18
0:01:16.160 --> 0:01:19.520
And we think that free software is crucial for that.

19
0:01:19.520 --> 0:01:23.600
We've been around for more than 20 years, have been campaigning legally and politically

20
0:01:23.600 --> 0:01:26.000
for free software and open source software.

21
0:01:26.000 --> 0:01:30.040
And we're relying on a strong community across Europe.

22
0:01:30.040 --> 0:01:37.520
So to give you a brief outline of my talk, first I'll talk about why does it make a difference,

23
0:01:37.520 --> 0:01:43.480
why does free software really matter, not only for your daily coding work, for your

24
0:01:43.480 --> 0:01:49.400
daily computer work, but also in building a sustainable and digital Europe that's ready

25
0:01:49.400 --> 0:01:51.920
for innovation and freedom.

26
0:01:51.920 --> 0:01:56.200
And a lot of the things that I'm going to tell you in the first part of my talk will

27
0:01:56.200 --> 0:02:00.240
be familiar to you, but I think it's good to put it together so you can use it as arguments

28
0:02:00.240 --> 0:02:05.280
when talking to your local administrations or to your politicians.

29
0:02:05.280 --> 0:02:13.240
So in the second step, I will show the PMPC campaign to you, which has been, yeah, we

30
0:02:13.240 --> 0:02:15.640
have been running it since 2017.

31
0:02:15.640 --> 0:02:20.280
And during last year's, it has gained a lot of momentum and has become a key part of the

32
0:02:20.280 --> 0:02:23.800
push for free software all over Europe.

33
0:02:23.800 --> 0:02:27.920
The last part, which will be the main focus of my talk, is how you can get involved in

34
0:02:27.920 --> 0:02:30.280
promoting free software.

35
0:02:30.280 --> 0:02:33.560
So let me start with a brief explanation of free software.

36
0:02:33.560 --> 0:02:35.280
I think definitions are important.

37
0:02:35.280 --> 0:02:40.360
And also if you talk to politicians and to administrations, always make sure that you

38
0:02:40.360 --> 0:02:43.760
have the same understanding of what you're talking about.

39
0:02:43.760 --> 0:02:48.360
So I think you're all familiar with the U.S. military chain of commands.

40
0:02:48.360 --> 0:02:56.240
There are the unified combat commanders, the secretary of defense, and on top of the hierarchy,

41
0:02:56.240 --> 0:02:58.120
of course, we have the president.

42
0:02:58.120 --> 0:03:04.000
He's the one who has to decide to press the red button or hopefully not to press it.

43
0:03:04.000 --> 0:03:09.680
But what about the guy, what about the girl or woman, the person who installed the red

44
0:03:09.680 --> 0:03:11.000
button?

45
0:03:11.000 --> 0:03:13.520
Can we be sure that it does what it should?

46
0:03:13.520 --> 0:03:16.400
And can we be sure that it works only when it's pushed?

47
0:03:16.400 --> 0:03:19.120
This is of some importance for us too.

48
0:03:19.120 --> 0:03:23.640
And this is one problem that free software can solve, but there are a lot of others.

49
0:03:23.640 --> 0:03:26.240
So what is free software?

50
0:03:26.240 --> 0:03:32.120
Free software grants everybody, everyone, for fundamental rights or for freedoms, the

51
0:03:32.120 --> 0:03:37.440
freedoms to use, to study, to share, and to improve the software.

52
0:03:37.440 --> 0:03:39.000
What does this mean?

53
0:03:39.000 --> 0:03:40.720
You can use anybody.

54
0:03:40.720 --> 0:03:42.400
Anyone can use the software for any purpose.

55
0:03:42.400 --> 0:03:43.600
There are no restrictions.

56
0:03:43.600 --> 0:03:46.240
You can do with it whatever you want.

57
0:03:46.240 --> 0:03:47.240
You can look into the code.

58
0:03:47.240 --> 0:03:51.480
You can study it and you can analyze it and also others can analyze it and find out what

59
0:03:51.480 --> 0:03:54.120
is going on behind the curtains.

60
0:03:54.120 --> 0:03:55.680
You can share the code.

61
0:03:55.680 --> 0:03:58.360
The software can be shared without limitations.

62
0:03:58.360 --> 0:04:01.000
And of course, you can also earn money with it.

63
0:04:01.000 --> 0:04:05.560
You don't have to sell it, but you can make money with it depending on your business model.

64
0:04:05.560 --> 0:04:09.760
Many people do, many developers do that and many companies.

65
0:04:09.760 --> 0:04:12.800
And you can, of course, improve the software.

66
0:04:12.800 --> 0:04:17.440
Also to make it better, you can, of course, also make it worse, but hopefully make it

67
0:04:17.440 --> 0:04:23.680
better and give it back to the community so others can work on it too and use it too.

68
0:04:23.680 --> 0:04:29.800
So why does free software matter to public bodies?

69
0:04:29.800 --> 0:04:33.440
Why should public bodies support free software?

70
0:04:33.440 --> 0:04:41.520
There are two fundamental mechanisms that are important for public bodies.

71
0:04:41.520 --> 0:04:44.280
One of them is digital sovereignty.

72
0:04:44.280 --> 0:04:49.520
So in order to establish trustworthy systems, public bodies must ensure that they have full

73
0:04:49.520 --> 0:04:56.040
control over the software and the computer systems at the core of all state digital infrastructure.

74
0:04:56.040 --> 0:04:57.920
This is very important.

75
0:04:57.920 --> 0:05:06.400
And the other basic maxim is tax money must be spent in the most efficient way possible.

76
0:05:06.400 --> 0:05:08.840
So public bodies are financed through taxes.

77
0:05:08.840 --> 0:05:13.120
They must make sure that they spend the funds in the most efficient way possible.

78
0:05:13.120 --> 0:05:19.040
And both maxims are undermined by the use of proprietary software.

79
0:05:19.040 --> 0:05:22.160
So let's have a look at some of the problems with proprietary software.

80
0:05:22.160 --> 0:05:26.400
First, there's no interoperability.

81
0:05:26.400 --> 0:05:32.840
So you all know situations where somebody sends you a file made with a proprietary software

82
0:05:32.840 --> 0:05:38.840
and you have to buy the software in order to open it or work with it or even buy a new

83
0:05:38.840 --> 0:05:42.160
computer and install a proprietary operating system.

84
0:05:42.160 --> 0:05:46.000
This of course also applies to administrations.

85
0:05:46.000 --> 0:05:48.640
And it leads to vendor lock-in.

86
0:05:48.640 --> 0:05:53.680
So administrations have to stick to their software solution if they use proprietary

87
0:05:53.680 --> 0:05:57.320
software not to lose compatibility, to be able to work together.

88
0:05:57.320 --> 0:05:59.280
And this is a big problem.

89
0:05:59.280 --> 0:06:03.240
It leads to unpredictable costs.

90
0:06:03.240 --> 0:06:06.320
You never know what next year's license cost will be.

91
0:06:06.320 --> 0:06:08.480
You have to pay for the upgrade in any way.

92
0:06:08.480 --> 0:06:09.480
You have to do it.

93
0:06:09.480 --> 0:06:16.160
You lock in and you have no chance to escape that if you're using proprietary software.

94
0:06:16.160 --> 0:06:20.680
And these investments that you are making, they are lost.

95
0:06:20.680 --> 0:06:23.000
They go to the vendor for the license.

96
0:06:23.000 --> 0:06:28.760
And you don't know if the software is made better with your money or even not.

97
0:06:28.760 --> 0:06:35.600
Maybe some features implemented you as an administration can't benefit from.

98
0:06:35.600 --> 0:06:38.840
So you don't have much control over new features.

99
0:06:38.840 --> 0:06:41.040
It's a vendor's decision.

100
0:06:41.040 --> 0:06:42.040
There's lack of transparency.

101
0:06:42.040 --> 0:06:50.240
We know from research and also from experience, for example, during the COVID pandemic, that

102
0:06:50.240 --> 0:06:56.400
there's low acceptance among citizens for proprietary digital services.

103
0:06:56.400 --> 0:07:02.240
So for example, the COVID tracking apps, we know that people respond better to them and

104
0:07:02.240 --> 0:07:08.360
attempt to using them more if they are free software open source.

105
0:07:08.360 --> 0:07:13.480
And if they know that their privacy, their fundamental rights and data protection also

106
0:07:13.480 --> 0:07:15.280
are guaranteed.

107
0:07:15.280 --> 0:07:18.880
And this leads also to the last point, security concerns.

108
0:07:18.880 --> 0:07:19.880
Trust is good.

109
0:07:19.880 --> 0:07:22.840
Trusting proprietary software can be dangerous.

110
0:07:22.840 --> 0:07:27.180
You never can show that there aren't any bugs, aren't any security holes or backdoors.

111
0:07:27.180 --> 0:07:30.560
So the solution for all of this is, of course, free software.

112
0:07:30.560 --> 0:07:34.200
With free software, you have interoperability through open standards.

113
0:07:34.200 --> 0:07:39.020
Free software and open standards are crucial for that and crucial for working across borders

114
0:07:39.020 --> 0:07:44.840
or across systems from other vendors.

115
0:07:44.840 --> 0:07:47.080
Free licenses give you independence.

116
0:07:47.080 --> 0:07:48.080
There is no vendor lock-in.

117
0:07:48.080 --> 0:07:52.340
Administrations are free to move to different solutions.

118
0:07:52.340 --> 0:07:58.180
And you can also, in the long run, save costs by using free software through collaboration.

119
0:07:58.180 --> 0:08:00.840
So free software, as we all know, is based on collaboration.

120
0:08:00.840 --> 0:08:03.640
Public bodies will benefit from this.

121
0:08:03.640 --> 0:08:08.480
If they adapt existing software or decide on joint procurement, for example, they can

122
0:08:08.480 --> 0:08:11.800
share risks and save money in the long run.

123
0:08:11.800 --> 0:08:14.960
And more and more examples for this kind of cooperation exist.

124
0:08:14.960 --> 0:08:19.520
I will come back with some examples a bit later.

125
0:08:19.520 --> 0:08:24.240
If you, as an administration, as a local government, are using free software, you can empower

126
0:08:24.240 --> 0:08:25.840
your local partners.

127
0:08:25.840 --> 0:08:30.920
If you opt for free software, you empower local IT companies instead of paying license

128
0:08:30.920 --> 0:08:34.320
fees to international or transnational corporations.

129
0:08:34.320 --> 0:08:39.040
And your local economy will benefit from this tax money.

130
0:08:39.040 --> 0:08:42.680
It will often be small and medium enterprises, SMEs.

131
0:08:42.680 --> 0:08:49.440
This makes a huge difference for your region, for your city, for your country and the citizens.

132
0:08:49.440 --> 0:08:51.320
Free software is transparent by default.

133
0:08:51.320 --> 0:08:56.360
This validates privacy, full data protection, and fundamental rights.

134
0:08:56.360 --> 0:09:00.560
And as I said, this is key to a higher acceptance by the citizens.

135
0:09:00.560 --> 0:09:04.360
And finally, free software code, as we all know, can be audited.

136
0:09:04.360 --> 0:09:05.600
We can look into it.

137
0:09:05.600 --> 0:09:08.360
Of course, it's not automatically free of bugs.

138
0:09:08.360 --> 0:09:14.560
And security problems, but publicly verifiable code is a prerequisite for finding these bugs

139
0:09:14.560 --> 0:09:20.480
and security problems and not leaving the security of critical infrastructures to proprietary

140
0:09:20.480 --> 0:09:22.600
companies.

141
0:09:22.600 --> 0:09:30.320
So let's have a look at the government's effect on IT companies, which effect can a

142
0:09:30.320 --> 0:09:34.000
free software policy have on the IT industry?

143
0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:43.920
Governments are among the largest IT purchasers, accounting for up to 27% of software companies'

144
0:09:43.920 --> 0:09:44.920
revenues.

145
0:09:44.920 --> 0:09:50.640
If we convince governments to spend money on free software rather than licenses, this

146
0:09:50.640 --> 0:09:55.160
can really make a huge difference for the whole IT economics.

147
0:09:55.160 --> 0:10:02.000
And we have a huge influence on economy, especially SMEs again, and your local economy.

148
0:10:02.000 --> 0:10:07.720
Given these numbers, what if public bodies decide on free software when procuring?

149
0:10:07.720 --> 0:10:14.920
What if free software becomes default locally, regionally, but also in your country or throughout

150
0:10:14.920 --> 0:10:15.920
Europe?

151
0:10:15.920 --> 0:10:21.320
First, as we said, tax savings, similar applications don't have to be programmed from scratch

152
0:10:21.320 --> 0:10:23.320
every time.

153
0:10:23.320 --> 0:10:29.320
So tax savings in the long run, if you can use software or parts from other projects,

154
0:10:29.320 --> 0:10:33.600
improve and adapt it, share and give back so others can do the same.

155
0:10:33.600 --> 0:10:38.800
Second, there's collaboration, major projects can share expertise and costs.

156
0:10:38.800 --> 0:10:43.600
Third, you serve the public by using free software, so applications paid by the public

157
0:10:43.600 --> 0:10:46.120
should be available to everyone.

158
0:10:46.120 --> 0:10:50.200
And lastly, fostering innovation.

159
0:10:50.200 --> 0:10:56.600
If you withdraw transparent processes, others don't have to reinvent the wheel and you can

160
0:10:56.600 --> 0:11:02.280
use brands and money to invent something new to come up with new solutions and new ideas.

161
0:11:02.280 --> 0:11:10.360
Instead of funding the same corporations for the same products again and again, SMEs can

162
0:11:10.360 --> 0:11:12.320
benefit from this.

163
0:11:12.320 --> 0:11:15.760
So let's have a look at some examples.

164
0:11:15.760 --> 0:11:21.440
France, for example, implemented a free software friendly politic for steps in that direction

165
0:11:21.440 --> 0:11:23.160
back in 2012.

166
0:11:23.160 --> 0:11:24.160
And what happened?

167
0:11:24.160 --> 0:11:31.640
In France, we saw up to 5.4 year increase in companies that use free software.

168
0:11:31.640 --> 0:11:38.840
We saw up to 18% yearly increase in the number of IT related startups, up to 14% yearly increase

169
0:11:38.840 --> 0:11:42.000
in the number of individuals employed in IT related jobs.

170
0:11:42.000 --> 0:11:44.160
This is very impressive, I think.

171
0:11:44.160 --> 0:11:52.760
And interesting side note, also up to 16% less software related patents.

172
0:11:52.760 --> 0:12:04.240
So yeah, if you as a government opt for free software, you can really make a difference

173
0:12:04.240 --> 0:12:06.840
also for your economy.

174
0:12:06.840 --> 0:12:12.200
And some more examples, looking at the city of Barcelona, which is a very famous example

175
0:12:12.200 --> 0:12:18.960
for the implementation of free software, they decided some years ago to spend 70% of their

176
0:12:18.960 --> 0:12:21.000
IT budget on free software projects.

177
0:12:21.000 --> 0:12:27.120
It's not everything, it's not 100%, but it's better and a lot better than nothing.

178
0:12:27.120 --> 0:12:31.160
And they decided also to collaborate with other cities.

179
0:12:31.160 --> 0:12:32.160
What happened?

180
0:12:32.160 --> 0:12:41.080
From 3,000 companies involved in the local IT business, 60% were SMEs, many from the

181
0:12:41.080 --> 0:12:42.600
region, of course.

182
0:12:42.600 --> 0:12:48.840
So the reasons for using free software in your administration, in your region, are not

183
0:12:48.840 --> 0:12:53.400
only technical, it's not only sovereignty, tax efficiency, but there are also good economic

184
0:12:53.400 --> 0:12:54.400
reasons to do so.

185
0:12:54.400 --> 0:12:57.560
And this is very interesting for politicians, of course.

186
0:12:57.560 --> 0:13:01.440
So Barcelona took a very important decision.

187
0:13:01.440 --> 0:13:05.640
They decided not to switch all systems at the same time, but went step by step.

188
0:13:05.640 --> 0:13:10.800
We know from other examples, from Munich, for example, with the Linux project that they

189
0:13:10.800 --> 0:13:20.240
decided to do a really fast change to free software to Linux in their administration,

190
0:13:20.240 --> 0:13:26.600
and it wasn't well accepted by many people working there, and it led to complexities.

191
0:13:26.600 --> 0:13:29.480
So we think the better idea is to do it step by step.

192
0:13:29.480 --> 0:13:33.240
So whenever new software is procured, go for free software.

193
0:13:33.240 --> 0:13:36.320
Whenever a license runs out, go for free software.

194
0:13:36.320 --> 0:13:42.240
And one other example, this time from Germany, there's a collaboration of nine municipalities

195
0:13:42.240 --> 0:13:43.600
from southern Germany.

196
0:13:43.600 --> 0:13:51.800
They call themselves Ready, and they decided to develop solutions together.

197
0:13:51.800 --> 0:13:58.640
So the starting point was during the COVID crisis when they started using a JITC implementation

198
0:13:58.640 --> 0:14:01.880
called it Palim-Palim.

199
0:14:01.880 --> 0:14:08.960
And they found it to be very useful for doing library lectures online, and other cities

200
0:14:08.960 --> 0:14:14.840
found it to be also very fitting their needs, and they decided to collaborate and exchange

201
0:14:14.840 --> 0:14:20.400
knowledge and work together on this and also on many other projects.

202
0:14:20.400 --> 0:14:24.520
So to cut along, shall we start?

203
0:14:24.520 --> 0:14:29.360
Why should administration support free software, regionality, autonomy, efficiency?

204
0:14:29.360 --> 0:14:33.840
When SMEs can become strong partners, free software helps to develop and maintain tailored

205
0:14:33.840 --> 0:14:37.760
software that suits your needs, not just the vendor's business model.

206
0:14:37.760 --> 0:14:41.520
And with transparent processes, others don't have to reinvent the wheel.

207
0:14:41.520 --> 0:14:45.360
Native products can share expertise and costs.

208
0:14:45.360 --> 0:14:52.480
Yes, of course, I gave you some examples, but there are many, many hundreds, thousands

209
0:14:52.480 --> 0:14:57.320
of cities throughout Europe who have not yet adapted free software.

210
0:14:57.320 --> 0:15:02.440
This is why we as the FSFE, Free Software Foundation Europe, decided back in 2017 to

211
0:15:02.440 --> 0:15:05.680
start the Public Money, Public Code campaign.

212
0:15:05.680 --> 0:15:08.160
And we have a long way to go.

213
0:15:08.160 --> 0:15:10.160
This is why we started this campaign.

214
0:15:10.160 --> 0:15:15.640
Our goal is to make free software the default in all public bodies at all levels across

215
0:15:15.640 --> 0:15:22.360
Europe and maybe also outside Europe, but for now across Europe.

216
0:15:22.360 --> 0:15:27.840
This is why we started the campaign demanding to use taxpayers' money only for free software.

217
0:15:27.840 --> 0:15:30.880
The mission statement that we have here is very easy.

218
0:15:30.880 --> 0:15:34.920
We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public

219
0:15:34.920 --> 0:15:40.080
sector may be publicly available under free and open source software license.

220
0:15:40.080 --> 0:15:45.000
If it is public money, it should be public code as well.

221
0:15:45.000 --> 0:15:46.520
We have an open letter.

222
0:15:46.520 --> 0:15:52.280
You can find it on this website, publiccode.eu.

223
0:15:52.280 --> 0:15:54.600
If you haven't signed it yet, you can do so now.

224
0:15:54.600 --> 0:16:00.600
There are already 34,000 people until now who have signed this letter.

225
0:16:00.600 --> 0:16:10.360
And not only individuals, but also many organizations have decided to support our campaign.

226
0:16:10.360 --> 0:16:15.560
I think it's yesterday I checked it, where 220 organizations throughout Europe backing

227
0:16:15.560 --> 0:16:16.560
our campaign.

228
0:16:16.560 --> 0:16:23.560
You will know many of the logos here, so many organizations back the public money, public

229
0:16:23.560 --> 0:16:27.120
code demand.

230
0:16:27.120 --> 0:16:32.200
And among them are also some administrations, some supporting administrations.

231
0:16:32.200 --> 0:16:33.920
Barcelona, I already mentioned.

232
0:16:33.920 --> 0:16:35.200
Here I think I have only six.

233
0:16:35.200 --> 0:16:36.600
It's seven by now.

234
0:16:36.600 --> 0:16:40.560
They are from Spain, from Germany, from Sweden and Luxembourg.

235
0:16:40.560 --> 0:16:45.360
Yes, but thousands haven't made their commitment yet.

236
0:16:45.360 --> 0:16:48.400
Many have a positive attitude towards free software.

237
0:16:48.400 --> 0:16:49.960
We saw that three weeks ago.

238
0:16:49.960 --> 0:16:56.760
We had an online event on the current situation in Dortmund, the city of Dortmund in Germany,

239
0:16:56.760 --> 0:17:01.000
where pro free software policy is just being implemented.

240
0:17:01.000 --> 0:17:07.760
And there were, I think, about 170 people joining in the event.

241
0:17:07.760 --> 0:17:10.080
And there were administrations all over Germany.

242
0:17:10.080 --> 0:17:16.680
So not only from Dortmund, but interest is there in many, many administrations, not only

243
0:17:16.680 --> 0:17:18.800
in Germany, all over Europe.

244
0:17:18.800 --> 0:17:20.920
They're interested.

245
0:17:20.920 --> 0:17:22.320
They need encouragement.

246
0:17:22.320 --> 0:17:24.200
They need good arguments.

247
0:17:24.200 --> 0:17:26.080
And they need an idea of how to start.

248
0:17:26.080 --> 0:17:30.560
And this is why we'd like to invite you to help.

249
0:17:30.560 --> 0:17:32.840
You can make a difference.

250
0:17:32.840 --> 0:17:35.400
You know your city and your region.

251
0:17:35.400 --> 0:17:41.920
And if you start an initiative coming up to your politicians with ideas and with demands,

252
0:17:41.920 --> 0:17:44.640
they will take you more seriously because it's their job.

253
0:17:44.640 --> 0:17:46.800
You are the citizens.

254
0:17:46.800 --> 0:17:48.880
So what can you do?

255
0:17:48.880 --> 0:17:52.720
With a campaign, we developed some tools for you you can use.

256
0:17:52.720 --> 0:17:55.960
I already talked about the open letter.

257
0:17:55.960 --> 0:17:58.480
By the way, have you signed it?

258
0:17:58.480 --> 0:17:59.960
I think everybody has now.

259
0:17:59.960 --> 0:18:00.960
Yes?

260
0:18:00.960 --> 0:18:01.960
I just tried to sign it.

261
0:18:01.960 --> 0:18:04.960
It was signed in the 404.

262
0:18:04.960 --> 0:18:07.960
I will try it in the 404.

263
0:18:07.960 --> 0:18:08.960
OK.

264
0:18:08.960 --> 0:18:11.920
This goes directly to our tech admins.

265
0:18:11.920 --> 0:18:16.320
But thank you for the effort.

266
0:18:16.320 --> 0:18:24.720
So it is out there in 22 languages.

267
0:18:24.720 --> 0:18:25.720
Yeah.

268
0:18:25.720 --> 0:18:27.520
And 22 languages.

269
0:18:27.520 --> 0:18:30.760
The open letter and also the website.

270
0:18:30.760 --> 0:18:32.280
Take it.

271
0:18:32.280 --> 0:18:36.440
We fixed the form.

272
0:18:36.440 --> 0:18:37.760
Send it to your local administration.

273
0:18:37.760 --> 0:18:38.960
Send it to your city council.

274
0:18:38.960 --> 0:18:43.720
Send it to your members of parliament and ask them to sign it to back this demand.

275
0:18:43.720 --> 0:18:48.880
Or even better or in the next step, make an appointment and talk to them about PMPC.

276
0:18:48.880 --> 0:18:51.360
Explain them the idea of free software.

277
0:18:51.360 --> 0:18:55.520
Explain them the idea of public money, public code.

278
0:18:55.520 --> 0:18:58.280
And tell them about the open letter.

279
0:18:58.280 --> 0:19:00.600
We have a brochure.

280
0:19:00.600 --> 0:19:01.600
It's this one.

281
0:19:01.600 --> 0:19:02.600
It's the pages.

282
0:19:02.600 --> 0:19:05.100
Gathering the above mentioned arguments.

283
0:19:05.100 --> 0:19:07.280
The best practices that we have.

284
0:19:07.280 --> 0:19:08.720
And ideas of how to start.

285
0:19:08.720 --> 0:19:14.240
And giving them good arguments for public money, public code.

286
0:19:14.240 --> 0:19:17.160
With this we're targeting experts from administrations.

287
0:19:17.160 --> 0:19:18.520
Also politicians.

288
0:19:18.520 --> 0:19:19.520
But also you.

289
0:19:19.520 --> 0:19:23.800
It can help you with finding good examples and good reasons for public money, public

290
0:19:23.800 --> 0:19:26.280
code to come up with.

291
0:19:26.280 --> 0:19:29.160
I think at the moment we have it in six languages.

292
0:19:29.160 --> 0:19:30.880
There are more to come.

293
0:19:30.880 --> 0:19:35.320
Also here if you, oh wow.

294
0:19:35.320 --> 0:19:40.120
Also if you want to help translating something, just come up to us.

295
0:19:40.120 --> 0:19:44.480
We always need help in translating our campaigns to different languages.

296
0:19:44.480 --> 0:19:45.480
We have many stickers.

297
0:19:45.480 --> 0:19:46.480
We have posters.

298
0:19:46.480 --> 0:19:47.480
We have postcards.

299
0:19:47.480 --> 0:19:52.000
Order them for free at our website, fse.org.

300
0:19:52.000 --> 0:19:55.360
Or come up to our booth after this talk.

301
0:19:55.360 --> 0:19:56.840
It's in the Kate building.

302
0:19:56.840 --> 0:19:57.840
And get some there.

303
0:19:57.840 --> 0:19:58.840
We also have a campaign video.

304
0:19:58.840 --> 0:20:03.280
I wanted to show it but I think there's no time left now.

305
0:20:03.280 --> 0:20:04.840
So you can find it on our website too.

306
0:20:04.840 --> 0:20:05.840
On the public code website.

307
0:20:05.840 --> 0:20:08.680
You have ten minutes if you'd like to show the video.

308
0:20:08.680 --> 0:20:12.400
I will use that better than for the video.

309
0:20:12.400 --> 0:20:14.200
Or maybe in the end.

310
0:20:14.200 --> 0:20:17.600
And the video I think is also out in about ten languages.

311
0:20:17.600 --> 0:20:24.760
So you can use it for your regional and country.

312
0:20:24.760 --> 0:20:30.520
Also if you want to contribute to the campaign, where can you start?

313
0:20:30.520 --> 0:20:35.520
You can of course focus on the national or international level.

314
0:20:35.520 --> 0:20:40.600
But you have to be aware that this is a long way to go and a lot of work.

315
0:20:40.600 --> 0:20:45.000
So if you have a long breath and staying power, then go for it.

316
0:20:45.000 --> 0:20:46.880
But there are other levels to start with.

317
0:20:46.880 --> 0:20:53.560
You can for example at your university or you can talk to your library, your local job

318
0:20:53.560 --> 0:21:00.880
agency or the school administration where during the COVID, again the COVID pandemic,

319
0:21:00.880 --> 0:21:04.720
everybody started to use Zoom or Google teams or something like that.

320
0:21:04.720 --> 0:21:08.440
Microsoft teams.

321
0:21:08.440 --> 0:21:13.800
And now maybe the next invoices for the next licenses are already on the table of the head

322
0:21:13.800 --> 0:21:18.880
of the department or they see that they need something more sustainable.

323
0:21:18.880 --> 0:21:24.360
Or they are even not really aware that there is something else like the Plubartan or Jitsi.

324
0:21:24.360 --> 0:21:27.660
So go to them and tell them.

325
0:21:27.660 --> 0:21:31.640
So acting on a local or regional level will be easier and success there will be a lower

326
0:21:31.640 --> 0:21:34.040
hanging fruit for you.

327
0:21:34.040 --> 0:21:35.040
Who can you reach out to?

328
0:21:35.040 --> 0:21:37.280
Who can you approach?

329
0:21:37.280 --> 0:21:42.160
Of course decision makers, so your city council, regional parliament, it makes sense.

330
0:21:42.160 --> 0:21:48.160
Go to talk to people from different institutions, also from different parties.

331
0:21:48.160 --> 0:21:54.800
And maybe also to an admin from your IT apartment, you might even find allies there who share

332
0:21:54.800 --> 0:21:58.200
the same view and help you.

333
0:21:58.200 --> 0:22:03.040
Don't be afraid of talking to people who might not share your views or to a party you're

334
0:22:03.040 --> 0:22:05.360
not leaning towards.

335
0:22:05.360 --> 0:22:11.040
Reach out, meet, talk, be friendly, even if they don't support you at first, you don't

336
0:22:11.040 --> 0:22:12.040
have anything to lose.

337
0:22:12.040 --> 0:22:13.040
You can just win.

338
0:22:13.040 --> 0:22:16.360
In the long run, you will maybe even change their minds.

339
0:22:16.360 --> 0:22:23.560
So really try to talk to everybody, not just to the persons you know that they are probably

340
0:22:23.560 --> 0:22:26.520
already convinced of public money, public code.

341
0:22:26.520 --> 0:22:27.520
What can you do?

342
0:22:27.520 --> 0:22:28.760
So how?

343
0:22:28.760 --> 0:22:32.840
Use the definitions, the examples and arguments I was talking about before.

344
0:22:32.840 --> 0:22:35.880
We are pretty sure for more information on that.

345
0:22:35.880 --> 0:22:36.880
Adapt your examples.

346
0:22:36.880 --> 0:22:37.880
This is very important.

347
0:22:37.880 --> 0:22:43.800
So if you're from Spain and you want to talk to a Spanish government, then maybe use the

348
0:22:43.800 --> 0:22:51.000
numbers from Barcelona or from Asturias better than from France or vice versa.

349
0:22:51.000 --> 0:22:52.480
Choose your arguments wisely.

350
0:22:52.480 --> 0:22:59.800
So if you're talking to somebody from a left-leaning party, maybe it's not so good to emphasize

351
0:22:59.800 --> 0:23:04.080
the economic arguments but more sustainability and empowering the people.

352
0:23:04.080 --> 0:23:08.960
If you're talking to someone from a liberal party or leaning towards the liberal side,

353
0:23:08.960 --> 0:23:10.520
economic is of course good.

354
0:23:10.520 --> 0:23:16.720
And conservative parties might be more interested in national sovereignty and how it is threatened

355
0:23:16.720 --> 0:23:17.720
by them to lock in.

356
0:23:17.720 --> 0:23:21.640
And free software is of course the gold standard in security.

357
0:23:21.640 --> 0:23:29.320
And most important thing, even if you don't have success at the moment, remain friendly.

358
0:23:29.320 --> 0:23:38.760
So an example, what you can achieve from Germany, the biggest conservative party in Germany,

359
0:23:38.760 --> 0:23:45.280
back in 2019, they decided to back our demand for public money, public code.

360
0:23:45.280 --> 0:23:46.280
This is also possible.

361
0:23:46.280 --> 0:23:51.640
And of course, don't hesitate to welcome such decisions.

362
0:23:51.640 --> 0:23:55.800
It's important to convince everybody of free software because it's making us as a community

363
0:23:55.800 --> 0:24:01.600
independent from who is having the government at the moment.

364
0:24:01.600 --> 0:24:10.240
And finally, when?

365
0:24:10.240 --> 0:24:14.520
Timing matters for your activities, keep your eyes open for relevant developments in your

366
0:24:14.520 --> 0:24:15.520
region.

367
0:24:15.520 --> 0:24:18.760
Are there any news about plans for a new IT strategy?

368
0:24:18.760 --> 0:24:20.880
Is there a new head of the IT department?

369
0:24:20.880 --> 0:24:23.920
Are there problems with school video conferencing tools?

370
0:24:23.920 --> 0:24:25.440
Don't miss these opportunities.

371
0:24:25.440 --> 0:24:29.680
Step in and talk about the best alternatives.

372
0:24:29.680 --> 0:24:32.560
But also don't wait for things to happen.

373
0:24:32.560 --> 0:24:34.800
Don't wait for such occasions.

374
0:24:34.800 --> 0:24:36.240
Rather be proactive.

375
0:24:36.240 --> 0:24:38.680
Writing or talking is never wrong.

376
0:24:38.680 --> 0:24:42.840
Keep in mind, if you do that, answers will take time.

377
0:24:42.840 --> 0:24:44.880
Be patient.

378
0:24:44.880 --> 0:24:49.520
Maybe write a friendly reminder after some weeks when you didn't get an answer.

379
0:24:49.520 --> 0:24:53.680
And after an appointment, be sure to always follow up and keep the communication going.

380
0:24:53.680 --> 0:24:54.680
Be always friendly.

381
0:24:54.680 --> 0:25:00.360
Very, very important, as I said before, because angry tweets or toots will close doors rather

382
0:25:00.360 --> 0:25:02.680
than opening it.

383
0:25:02.680 --> 0:25:05.360
So finally, one more example.

384
0:25:05.360 --> 0:25:06.920
Again from Spain.

385
0:25:06.920 --> 0:25:13.640
So very Spain and Germany focused here.

386
0:25:13.640 --> 0:25:15.360
This time from Orviedo.

387
0:25:15.360 --> 0:25:18.840
It's a community in the region of Asturias.

388
0:25:18.840 --> 0:25:20.680
Maybe somebody in the picture is also in the room.

389
0:25:20.680 --> 0:25:21.680
I don't know.

390
0:25:21.680 --> 0:25:29.520
There was a little hack lab, the Pika-Pika hack lab, and they decided back in 2015 to

391
0:25:29.520 --> 0:25:34.400
start demanding public money, public code from their local authorities.

392
0:25:34.400 --> 0:25:40.360
And they didn't have success at first, but then they got into contact with our campaign

393
0:25:40.360 --> 0:25:47.760
and they used our materials and they really had a long breath reaching out to communities

394
0:25:47.760 --> 0:25:54.600
and used these arguments to all parties, towards all parties, and convinced many people.

395
0:25:54.600 --> 0:25:59.360
They wrote emails and they managed to get face-to-face meetings, which is very important

396
0:25:59.360 --> 0:26:01.360
if you reach out to politicians.

397
0:26:01.360 --> 0:26:02.720
And they had a little social hack.

398
0:26:02.720 --> 0:26:07.880
So once you're inside the parliament, you have to get inside somehow and somebody has

399
0:26:07.880 --> 0:26:08.880
to let you in.

400
0:26:08.880 --> 0:26:12.480
But once you're inside, you can just knock doors and doors will open.

401
0:26:12.480 --> 0:26:16.860
So find somebody who lets you in the parliament.

402
0:26:16.860 --> 0:26:22.560
So what they managed to do is the parliament of Asturias, of the bigger region in Spain,

403
0:26:22.560 --> 0:26:26.220
stating the parliament of Asturias commits itself to the international public money,

404
0:26:26.220 --> 0:26:27.700
public code campaign.

405
0:26:27.700 --> 0:26:30.520
This is not legally binding, but it's a first step.

406
0:26:30.520 --> 0:26:35.200
And what is also really, really important, people now there understand free software,

407
0:26:35.200 --> 0:26:38.600
the politicians.

408
0:26:38.600 --> 0:26:41.840
What does success mean for your approaches?

409
0:26:41.840 --> 0:26:46.600
So if you can get somebody to sign the letter, if you can get a government to sign the letter

410
0:26:46.600 --> 0:26:49.720
or parliament, this of course really, really good.

411
0:26:49.720 --> 0:26:54.800
But don't be frustrated if a library board decides against free software or if the city

412
0:26:54.800 --> 0:27:01.700
council PMPC statement has loopholes or things move slowly in administrations.

413
0:27:01.700 --> 0:27:03.880
Sometimes you really need to have a long breath.

414
0:27:03.880 --> 0:27:06.520
But you've talked and you've convinced someone.

415
0:27:06.520 --> 0:27:12.240
And we have time, we have a long breath, and we will finally succeed.

416
0:27:12.240 --> 0:27:16.080
So that was the main thing of my talk.

417
0:27:16.080 --> 0:27:22.000
Really, if you want, you can come up to our booth at a set in Building K, level one.

418
0:27:22.000 --> 0:27:23.920
Just take some material there.

419
0:27:23.920 --> 0:27:29.100
And also, if you want to support the FSFE's work, you can do that with a donation.

420
0:27:29.100 --> 0:27:34.120
We would be very grateful for that because we're a charity and we depend on donations.

421
0:27:34.120 --> 0:27:39.240
And you have the chance also to get your copy of this really lovely children's book, which

422
0:27:39.240 --> 0:27:43.440
explains the idea behind free software to children.

423
0:27:43.440 --> 0:27:46.360
So thank you for listening.

424
0:27:46.360 --> 0:27:50.400
And yes, I'm open for questions.

425
0:27:50.400 --> 0:28:01.240
We have time for one question and I have seen one hand.

426
0:28:01.240 --> 0:28:03.880
Excellent.

427
0:28:03.880 --> 0:28:06.560
Maybe two questions if people speak quickly.

428
0:28:06.560 --> 0:28:14.600
Yeah, I think that it did not come out from your talk if there's public money, public

429
0:28:14.600 --> 0:28:15.600
codes.

430
0:28:15.600 --> 0:28:19.960
This means they save a lot of money if they now choose open source software.

431
0:28:19.960 --> 0:28:22.640
How much developer do they hire?

432
0:28:22.640 --> 0:28:28.720
Do they do audits or is it now just all the open source software projects have much more

433
0:28:28.720 --> 0:28:30.720
users which are not developer?

434
0:28:30.720 --> 0:28:41.160
The open source project has now much more users and these users have ideas and maybe

435
0:28:41.160 --> 0:28:43.080
find bugs.

436
0:28:43.080 --> 0:28:50.400
But the amount of developers seems not to increase or who does the audits for the software

437
0:28:50.400 --> 0:28:54.720
that the public domains are using now.

438
0:28:54.720 --> 0:29:02.400
This is also in your plan from the free software foundation just to save them money for what?

439
0:29:02.400 --> 0:29:12.960
The question is to say this company's public company is public money and use public codes.

440
0:29:12.960 --> 0:29:15.160
So they save a lot of money.

441
0:29:15.160 --> 0:29:18.680
Did they hire any open source developer?

442
0:29:18.680 --> 0:29:19.680
Yeah.

443
0:29:19.680 --> 0:29:20.680
So the idea is...

444
0:29:20.680 --> 0:29:21.680
Who say audits?

445
0:29:21.680 --> 0:29:23.040
Who has the work?

446
0:29:23.040 --> 0:29:27.640
The idea is of course not to take away the money from the companies.

447
0:29:27.640 --> 0:29:35.680
The idea is of course that the money is used in a better way and we all know that software

448
0:29:35.680 --> 0:29:42.520
developers have to be paid somehow but it should be rather through maintenance fees

449
0:29:42.520 --> 0:29:49.240
and through development of new features or audits than through license fees.

450
0:29:49.240 --> 0:29:53.400
This is what we also try with this campaign to tell them.

451
0:29:53.400 --> 0:29:55.920
Okay, so only one question.

452
0:29:55.920 --> 0:29:57.680
It is only one question, yeah.

453
0:29:57.680 --> 0:29:59.360
Building K for more.

454
0:29:59.360 --> 0:30:00.360
Wonderful people.

455
0:30:00.360 --> 0:30:01.360
Yeah.

456
0:30:01.360 --> 0:30:02.360
Thank you very much for having us.

457
0:30:02.360 --> 0:30:20.160
Thank you very much.
