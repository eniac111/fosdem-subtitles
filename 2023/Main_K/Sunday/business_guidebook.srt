0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.840
Hello, everyone. Hello, hello, hello. It looks like it is time for me to begin. So if you

2
0:00:11.840 --> 0:00:17.780
are here for this topic, you know, you're in the right place. That's awesome. Who am

3
0:00:17.780 --> 0:00:24.500
I? I am Matt Yakovitz. I am the head of open source strategy at SCARF or the HOSS for short.

4
0:00:24.500 --> 0:00:29.920
You may have heard me or seen talks from me before. Multiple ways to connect with me.

5
0:00:29.920 --> 0:00:33.920
I will podcast different things that I do. If you don't know what SCARF does, what we

6
0:00:33.920 --> 0:00:40.360
do is we help projects and maintainers grow their open source adoption, help track it,

7
0:00:40.360 --> 0:00:45.840
help analyze it, help you understand who is downloading and using your open source software.

8
0:00:45.840 --> 0:00:53.000
We also do a hacking open source business podcast. And so that is up to 14 episodes,

9
0:00:53.000 --> 0:00:59.040
I think, are recorded now. So if you're interested in understanding from others on what is working

10
0:00:59.040 --> 0:01:04.520
in the open source business space, okay, seems like I need to hold it a little closer, then

11
0:01:04.520 --> 0:01:09.840
that would be a good place to check out. We're also launching a new website that has all

12
0:01:09.840 --> 0:01:15.320
of the information from these slides as well as a whole bunch of other details on how to

13
0:01:15.320 --> 0:01:20.640
measure your open source businesses. And we have it under open source metrics.org. If you're

14
0:01:20.640 --> 0:01:26.360
interested, there's links to the podcast and various things on running an open source business

15
0:01:26.360 --> 0:01:33.800
and measuring it. So how many people here know open source is different? Right? Unlike

16
0:01:33.800 --> 0:01:37.800
other businesses, obviously you are competing with free, which changes the mindset quite

17
0:01:37.800 --> 0:01:42.840
a bit. Let me give you an example. It's a very easy example and people will pick it

18
0:01:42.840 --> 0:01:48.160
apart, but let me just, you know, get through it real quick. If you're selling a car nowadays,

19
0:01:48.160 --> 0:01:52.480
if you're a car manufacturer, you have the ability to set your price for the car. People

20
0:01:52.480 --> 0:01:57.360
can walk away from the car. If they don't buy a car or a vehicle, then they would have

21
0:01:57.360 --> 0:02:03.360
to choose some other alternative modes of transportation. If you use a car that's in

22
0:02:03.360 --> 0:02:08.360
the open source space, you can still set the price for the car, but you don't actually

23
0:02:08.360 --> 0:02:11.360
have to pay for it. So someone can come get the car for free, drive it around and do whatever

24
0:02:11.360 --> 0:02:17.360
they want with it. So consumers can choose to buy your car or someone else. And that

25
0:02:17.360 --> 0:02:21.880
boggles the mind of many traditional business folks because it's giving something away for

26
0:02:21.880 --> 0:02:30.520
free. And one of the key things that people misunderstand about open source is it's great

27
0:02:30.520 --> 0:02:34.840
if it's free and people can use it, but in order for people not to choose the free version

28
0:02:34.840 --> 0:02:40.320
and pay for something that's in the commercial space, it has to give you more value than

29
0:02:40.320 --> 0:02:43.720
what you're going to get in that free space. You have to figure out some way to connect

30
0:02:43.720 --> 0:02:50.400
with those folks and you have to make sure that they are finding value in what you have.

31
0:02:50.400 --> 0:02:53.640
Now some of you, and I'm interested to know, how many people are more in the tech space

32
0:02:53.640 --> 0:02:57.920
in here? Can you raise your right hands? Okay, how many people on the business space raise

33
0:02:57.920 --> 0:03:03.840
your left foot? Okay, so few. Well, so many in the tech space consider this type of a

34
0:03:03.840 --> 0:03:07.280
talk when we talk about revenue and money evil. So I'm going to go ahead and put on

35
0:03:07.280 --> 0:03:13.800
my other hat, which is my super evil villain hat, you know, for this talk. And that doesn't

36
0:03:13.800 --> 0:03:19.020
necessarily mean that this is wrong or that it is super evil or villainous, but it's hard

37
0:03:19.020 --> 0:03:23.080
for tech folks, especially founders, to talk about revenue and money. This is outside of

38
0:03:23.080 --> 0:03:27.800
the wheelhouse, right? From a technical standpoint, when we talk about growing, you know, your

39
0:03:27.800 --> 0:03:33.200
business, that's not something that is naturally inherent. So people seek out different advisors,

40
0:03:33.200 --> 0:03:37.120
they look for who's done it before, what sort of things have worked, and then they try to

41
0:03:37.120 --> 0:03:42.740
repeat that process. So I want to start by giving some baselines. There's a lot of common

42
0:03:42.740 --> 0:03:47.600
open source business models out there. There's several, but I'm going to talk about the three

43
0:03:47.600 --> 0:03:52.480
primary ones. And that's open core, a SaaS model, or as a service model, it could be

44
0:03:52.480 --> 0:03:59.880
infrastructure, platform as a service, just consider all those the same, or services themselves.

45
0:03:59.880 --> 0:04:04.320
Now from an open core perspective, okay, and excuse all the graphics in this, I'm not a

46
0:04:04.320 --> 0:04:10.520
graphics designer, so, you know, they're a little hokey, but open core. How many people

47
0:04:10.520 --> 0:04:16.240
have heard of open core before? Oh, the vast majority, but not everyone. Okay. So open

48
0:04:16.240 --> 0:04:20.680
core is when you have an open source version of your project that's freely available for

49
0:04:20.680 --> 0:04:24.280
everyone, but then you have an enterprise version. The enterprise version reserves some

50
0:04:24.280 --> 0:04:29.160
set of features, and then if someone wants those features, typically more enterprise

51
0:04:29.160 --> 0:04:34.320
features like maybe higher security integration with partner products, things like that, then

52
0:04:34.320 --> 0:04:38.720
people will then have the ability to purchase that from you, and then they'll pay a regular

53
0:04:38.720 --> 0:04:44.020
ongoing fee. A lot of companies have dual licenses in this case, so their open source

54
0:04:44.020 --> 0:04:50.600
is, you know, let's say GPL, and then there's some enterprise license for their, you know,

55
0:04:50.600 --> 0:04:56.880
enterprise version. Okay. Now this is dwindling a little bit in popularity as the cloud has

56
0:04:56.880 --> 0:05:03.040
taken over much of the tech industry, and that's where a lot of new businesses, especially

57
0:05:03.040 --> 0:05:08.060
in the open source space, are looking, and that's in this SaaS or this cloud model. Okay.

58
0:05:08.060 --> 0:05:12.160
You can download the software, but if you really want to run it, then, you know, you

59
0:05:12.160 --> 0:05:18.360
should use our SaaS thing. We'll make it easier. This provides a higher level of quote-unquote

60
0:05:18.360 --> 0:05:25.880
stickiness. Now, if you are a manager, director, executive at a company that has, you know,

61
0:05:25.880 --> 0:05:30.320
venture funding or that you're, you know, has executives who are, you know, kind of

62
0:05:30.320 --> 0:05:34.680
been in the industry for a while, I guarantee that they have had at least ten conversations

63
0:05:34.680 --> 0:05:40.700
about stickiness in open source in a calendar year, and what stickiness is, is the ability

64
0:05:40.700 --> 0:05:45.260
for someone to start to use your open source software and then continue to use it. So how

65
0:05:45.260 --> 0:05:51.680
do we make it sticky? How do we retain them? In many companies, this is a model that provides

66
0:05:51.680 --> 0:05:56.320
a higher level of stickiness, because once you get into a cloud service, it's often really,

67
0:05:56.320 --> 0:06:00.520
really difficult to migrate away, because you're relying on that cloud service to be

68
0:06:00.520 --> 0:06:06.040
your sys admins, your DBAs, your, you know, DevOps folks. They're handling all those functions,

69
0:06:06.040 --> 0:06:10.200
and so to replace that, you either have to go to another cloud service or you need to

70
0:06:10.200 --> 0:06:14.880
find someone who can do those functions for you, and that's often a really difficult prospect

71
0:06:14.880 --> 0:06:22.240
to do. But there are some issues with this model. This model is disruptible, because

72
0:06:22.240 --> 0:06:27.400
other people can run that exact same as a service. What we've been seeing in the space

73
0:06:27.400 --> 0:06:32.680
of the SAS lately is a lot of open source companies have changed their licenses to prevent

74
0:06:32.680 --> 0:06:38.080
that, and they've gone from open to not open. So you might have heard of SSPL, you might

75
0:06:38.080 --> 0:06:45.200
have heard of the BSL, other things. These licenses are kind of sort of open, but that

76
0:06:45.200 --> 0:06:50.040
means that, you know, as you get into the cloud space, you're restricted from competing

77
0:06:50.040 --> 0:06:55.320
with them, so it's more of a preservation of their revenue stream, if you will.

78
0:06:55.320 --> 0:07:01.440
And then there's the services model, which is really the original kind of OG, the old,

79
0:07:01.440 --> 0:07:06.520
you know, model for open source software, and that model is definitely something that

80
0:07:06.520 --> 0:07:13.880
we have seen be very popular and very successful in a lot of different companies. This is a

81
0:07:13.880 --> 0:07:19.560
viable pathway for a lot of companies to start. It's an easier pathway to revenue, but it

82
0:07:19.560 --> 0:07:24.800
is hard to grow beyond a certain limit. So, you know, you might be able to get a handful

83
0:07:24.800 --> 0:07:31.200
of customers working with you from a support perspective, from a consulting perspective,

84
0:07:31.200 --> 0:07:35.160
but you're really bound on the number of people, because you have to have people to deliver

85
0:07:35.160 --> 0:07:38.720
those services, and if you don't have people to deliver those services, that becomes quite

86
0:07:38.720 --> 0:07:40.720
an issue.

87
0:07:40.720 --> 0:07:45.200
And if you compare the three models, you know, you can compare them. You've got that open

88
0:07:45.200 --> 0:07:49.400
core, which is a proven model, but it is getting disrupted and eroded by the cloud a little

89
0:07:49.400 --> 0:07:55.800
bit. And, you know, there's still some success in that space, because a lot of companies,

90
0:07:55.800 --> 0:07:59.840
especially when you listen to some of the sovereign cloud, the cloud native, they're

91
0:07:59.840 --> 0:08:04.020
looking at enterprise versions or open core versions, they want to run their operators.

92
0:08:04.020 --> 0:08:09.120
They want to build their own private clouds. So, there is still some play in that space.

93
0:08:09.120 --> 0:08:14.700
X as a service or software as a service, you know, that is still a very popular model.

94
0:08:14.700 --> 0:08:19.760
But the question is, if you are releasing features that are only available in a SaaS

95
0:08:19.760 --> 0:08:26.040
version and only a minimal open source version, is SaaS, the SaaS model, is it still open

96
0:08:26.040 --> 0:08:31.280
source? Or is it not? And that's a question that we really haven't answered yet, especially

97
0:08:31.280 --> 0:08:37.200
as companies start to reserve features and software specifically just for their SaaS

98
0:08:37.200 --> 0:08:40.960
customers. And then there's the service model, which is definitely the easiest to get started

99
0:08:40.960 --> 0:08:46.360
if you're a small company. It, you know, has the most likelihood that you'll get some revenue

100
0:08:46.360 --> 0:08:51.360
in the door really quickly without a huge buy in cost.

101
0:08:51.360 --> 0:08:58.400
Now part of this model, okay, if you, whether you choose, whichever model you choose is

102
0:08:58.400 --> 0:09:05.920
how do you get people to move from being open source users to actually paying customers?

103
0:09:05.920 --> 0:09:15.240
Okay. And, you know, this is probably the most stressful thing an open source maintainer,

104
0:09:15.240 --> 0:09:22.000
founder, someone in the open source space has. Because ultimately, you're looking at

105
0:09:22.000 --> 0:09:27.240
this open source adoption and let's say you're tracking 100 million downloads, but nobody

106
0:09:27.240 --> 0:09:32.120
wants to pay for anything. That's actually a use case that happens quite a bit. How do

107
0:09:32.120 --> 0:09:36.520
you, how do you, how do you figure that out? How do you, how do you turn that 100 million

108
0:09:36.520 --> 0:09:42.880
downloads? How do you turn that, you know, 5,000 people who are tweeting about you into

109
0:09:42.880 --> 0:09:47.200
something that is actually commercially viable?

110
0:09:47.200 --> 0:09:52.440
And when we go look at the classic sort of marketing funnel, and anybody here in marketing,

111
0:09:52.440 --> 0:09:57.520
I'm just curious. No one, well, one person, two people want to admit it. Hey, three people.

112
0:09:57.520 --> 0:10:03.000
Okay. Oh, look at that. All right. So you might be familiar with this if you are in

113
0:10:03.000 --> 0:10:06.840
marketing, right? So this is just this very simple marketing funnel where you've got,

114
0:10:06.840 --> 0:10:11.640
you know, people who are hitting your website and they turn into a contact or a lead, if

115
0:10:11.640 --> 0:10:17.200
you will, where they become a known user and then they turn into a marketing qualified

116
0:10:17.200 --> 0:10:20.460
lead after they do a certain number of things. So let's say you're there on your website,

117
0:10:20.460 --> 0:10:24.040
sign up for a webinar, maybe they downloaded your software, maybe they did a few other

118
0:10:24.040 --> 0:10:27.440
things. They get a certain number of points and when they reach the point value, then

119
0:10:27.440 --> 0:10:32.600
all of a sudden it's like, woo hoo, you are now qualified. So then sales can talk to you.

120
0:10:32.600 --> 0:10:37.080
And then you have a, you know, sales accepted lead. So sales goes, ooh, that looks pretty

121
0:10:37.080 --> 0:10:41.520
good. And then you have a sales qualified lead when they start to say, hmm, I think

122
0:10:41.520 --> 0:10:45.840
I could sell something. All right. This is the classic marketing funnel, but it doesn't

123
0:10:45.840 --> 0:10:53.960
work in an open source space. There is a similar way to think about this, okay? Because the

124
0:10:53.960 --> 0:10:59.700
open source model kind of flips this on its head. There is this model where we've got

125
0:10:59.700 --> 0:11:05.040
the interest phase, which is the people who are discovering what your product can do,

126
0:11:05.040 --> 0:11:11.320
how it can behave, what it can do differently. And you want them to actually try your software,

127
0:11:11.320 --> 0:11:17.520
okay? You want them to install your software or use your containers or use your library

128
0:11:17.520 --> 0:11:23.960
in, you know, their product. And only a subset of those who are actually interested, a subset

129
0:11:23.960 --> 0:11:28.880
of those who will visit your project's webpage, visit your webpages, visit your assets, they're

130
0:11:28.880 --> 0:11:36.680
all, only that small subset is going to actually try. And of those who try, only a subset will

131
0:11:36.680 --> 0:11:44.040
continue to use it in production. And then only a subset will become a customer. So that

132
0:11:44.040 --> 0:11:51.400
model is very important because as we look at this phase, you've got to realize that

133
0:11:51.400 --> 0:11:56.620
if you have a million people on your website and you have 100,000 downloads, that's great.

134
0:11:56.620 --> 0:12:00.680
But there might only be 10,000 who use it in production and that might only have like

135
0:12:00.680 --> 0:12:05.080
a thousand people who would be willing to pay for it. Now, some of you who are familiar

136
0:12:05.080 --> 0:12:09.280
with the product space might say, well, we don't follow the funnel, we follow the, you

137
0:12:09.280 --> 0:12:14.280
know, product flywheel, the product growth flywheel. So anybody familiar with the product

138
0:12:14.280 --> 0:12:21.240
growth flywheel? All right, one. Okay. So the idea is, it's funny because they actually

139
0:12:21.240 --> 0:12:25.920
stole a lot of this from the open source movement. When you look at the product flywheel, and

140
0:12:25.920 --> 0:12:29.480
this is all the hotness in all the product companies, right? So when we're talking about

141
0:12:29.480 --> 0:12:35.400
a product led company, a product, you know, product led growth, what they're talking about is people

142
0:12:35.400 --> 0:12:40.600
start off in this center, this core, and it's like, oh, how do we track and engage with

143
0:12:40.600 --> 0:12:45.240
people? How do we delight them? How do we make them really excited about things? Okay.

144
0:12:45.240 --> 0:12:48.880
And then we can take those strangers, turn them into prospects, which then turns them

145
0:12:48.880 --> 0:12:54.480
into customers, which then turns them into fans. And then they will start to become the

146
0:12:54.480 --> 0:12:59.480
people who will preach to the other people to tell other people how awesome our software

147
0:12:59.480 --> 0:13:04.840
is and get them into the community. There's an open source version of this. And again,

148
0:13:04.840 --> 0:13:10.720
excuse my crappy little, you know, diagrams here. If someone wants to contribute these

149
0:13:10.720 --> 0:13:17.720
better versions, that's awesome. But the idea here is it's very similar, similar phases.

150
0:13:17.720 --> 0:13:23.120
But if you look at the differences, the differences are we have a download and try, we have that

151
0:13:23.120 --> 0:13:27.920
build and deploy into production. And then we have, oh, they're running it into prod.

152
0:13:27.920 --> 0:13:31.640
And then it kind of goes into, hey, do I need something more? That's when I'd be willing

153
0:13:31.640 --> 0:13:37.480
to pay. And then you'll evaluate a paid option and become that paying customer. It's a very

154
0:13:37.480 --> 0:13:41.960
similar cycle. Both are the same, but there's a few differences. I like to clarify this

155
0:13:41.960 --> 0:13:45.080
a little bit more in the open source space because it makes sense. Because really what

156
0:13:45.080 --> 0:13:49.480
you're talking about here is someone who's trying your open source software, they're

157
0:13:49.480 --> 0:13:53.520
getting used to it. They're like, wow, this is pretty cool. But if it only did this next

158
0:13:53.520 --> 0:13:57.360
thing, and then you're like, oh, well, I have that. It's in the enterprise version. Right?

159
0:13:57.360 --> 0:14:04.240
If it only did, you know, you know, integration with this other product. And so that's where,

160
0:14:04.240 --> 0:14:10.360
oh, I need something more. And then you get them to evaluate it. And that becomes a way

161
0:14:10.360 --> 0:14:18.880
to build external evangelists. So there's also this idea of evangelism or evangelists.

162
0:14:18.880 --> 0:14:23.960
A way to foster people who are in your community, who become fans of your product, who then

163
0:14:23.960 --> 0:14:29.960
actually go out and contribute to that flywheel. Right? So the goal here is you want someone

164
0:14:29.960 --> 0:14:36.000
who can start off telling people, wow, I was really successful with this application. And

165
0:14:36.000 --> 0:14:40.280
then they'll tell their followers and people who like them and people who are like-minded.

166
0:14:40.280 --> 0:14:44.800
And then those people will watch that content. And then those people will go ahead and try

167
0:14:44.800 --> 0:14:51.400
it. And it's similar when you add dev rel, evangelism, this is all part of that product

168
0:14:51.400 --> 0:14:56.600
flywheel, where you want more people to understand it and then eventually try it. And then eventually

169
0:14:56.600 --> 0:15:01.840
you want those people to create or help foster new people into the community where there

170
0:15:01.840 --> 0:15:07.520
are new evangelists who can go out there and talk about your product.

171
0:15:07.520 --> 0:15:13.460
So let's talk specifically about driving open source adoption. Okay? And there's only three

172
0:15:13.460 --> 0:15:17.080
things you need to do. Yeah, I'm going to sound like one of those shill salesmen on

173
0:15:17.080 --> 0:15:21.520
the late night TV commercials where it's like, you know, these three things, if you buy into

174
0:15:21.520 --> 0:15:27.040
my system, you'll be awesome. This will be the best thing ever for you. And so there's

175
0:15:27.040 --> 0:15:32.040
actually three requirements that we'll dig into a little bit as much as we can in the

176
0:15:32.040 --> 0:15:38.600
time remaining for driving open source adoption and growing your open source adoption. And

177
0:15:38.600 --> 0:15:44.680
those secrets to the success are a kiss-ass product. Okay? It all starts with the product.

178
0:15:44.680 --> 0:15:49.160
If you don't have a product that people want, it doesn't matter what else you do. They're

179
0:15:49.160 --> 0:15:53.640
not going to, you know, listen to you. They're not going to try it out. It needs to be rock

180
0:15:53.640 --> 0:16:01.080
solid. We need people to know who you are. Okay? A lot of open source projects that are

181
0:16:01.080 --> 0:16:06.240
out there have awesome technology behind them, but nobody knows who they are. Has anybody

182
0:16:06.240 --> 0:16:10.040
run into a product like, and said, like, how did I not know about that like three years

183
0:16:10.040 --> 0:16:16.920
ago? Right? That happens. And why is that? Because, however, you know, whoever's running

184
0:16:16.920 --> 0:16:22.320
these projects, they're not really sure how to bring awareness to everyone else. And then

185
0:16:22.320 --> 0:16:29.320
you need to make it easier than all the alternatives out there in the space. Okay? Obvious, right?

186
0:16:29.320 --> 0:16:34.080
All these are obvious. It's not like it's like anything that's just crazy. All these

187
0:16:34.080 --> 0:16:42.960
should be obvious and easy as well. Now, I can't go into a deep dive for all of these,

188
0:16:42.960 --> 0:16:48.400
but briefly I want to touch on each one, and we'll go through each one separately. So how

189
0:16:48.400 --> 0:16:54.320
do you build a kick-ass open source project? Now, I can tell you, like, you know, all the

190
0:16:54.320 --> 0:16:58.560
technical jargon, but I'm going to stick with from a business perspective what this looks

191
0:16:58.560 --> 0:17:03.280
like. First, I want to talk about the biggest mistake we all make when we're building a

192
0:17:03.280 --> 0:17:09.080
project. At a certain point, we have to realize that, you know, when we are building a project,

193
0:17:09.080 --> 0:17:14.880
we're often starting it, building it for what we want. And that works for maybe, like, a

194
0:17:14.880 --> 0:17:18.360
little bit of time. And you might even make a successful company, but you're going to

195
0:17:18.360 --> 0:17:22.720
limit your growth if you are building for people who you think are the exact same people

196
0:17:22.720 --> 0:17:29.840
as you. Right? It's that, oh, I assume everyone is like me. I know people who follow this,

197
0:17:29.840 --> 0:17:33.280
and they're like, well, I assume that everyone is going to install on the command line. I

198
0:17:33.280 --> 0:17:38.960
assume everyone will install from source. And so that's just the way that they think.

199
0:17:38.960 --> 0:17:42.600
That's not necessarily how everyone else in the community thinks. So make sure that you

200
0:17:42.600 --> 0:17:50.600
avoid that. And that's why the first key, in my opinion, is understanding. Right? Understand

201
0:17:50.600 --> 0:17:56.600
the product and its value. Right? What can your product do better than anyone else? Okay?

202
0:17:56.600 --> 0:17:59.320
Are people willing to even pay for that? You should ask yourself that question. Can you

203
0:17:59.320 --> 0:18:04.640
answer that question? What do you do over the alternative? Right? So is there an alternative

204
0:18:04.640 --> 0:18:09.680
to this? Is there some other piece of software, something else that other people are doing?

205
0:18:09.680 --> 0:18:14.200
What do you consider success? Now, this one is really interesting. I've talked to a lot

206
0:18:14.200 --> 0:18:18.240
of founders. I've talked to a lot of CEOs, executives. And, you know, they'll talk to

207
0:18:18.240 --> 0:18:22.440
me about, oh, we want to accelerate our growth, our adoption. And I'll say, well, what's your

208
0:18:22.440 --> 0:18:26.880
goal? And they'll be like, well, we want to, you know, sell the company, or we want 10X

209
0:18:26.880 --> 0:18:30.360
valuation, or we want, like, you know, fill in the blank. It's like, no, no, no. What

210
0:18:30.360 --> 0:18:35.920
do you really want? What do you want in the next year? What do you really, really want?

211
0:18:35.920 --> 0:18:39.720
And a lot of times it's like, oh, well, really what we want is people to sign up for our

212
0:18:39.720 --> 0:18:43.260
new beta. I've actually had that conversation where it's like, we just want like a thousand

213
0:18:43.260 --> 0:18:48.680
people to try it and then give us feedback. Well, it's a very different sort of product

214
0:18:48.680 --> 0:18:52.480
that you're building and sort of, and also marketing activities or community activities

215
0:18:52.480 --> 0:18:57.600
that you're doing. And so that's something to consider. Who's going to use it? Are you

216
0:18:57.600 --> 0:19:02.920
building this for, you know, devs? Are you building this for business folks? Who's the

217
0:19:02.920 --> 0:19:08.620
end user? Who's going to benefit from this the most? And who would pay for that product

218
0:19:08.620 --> 0:19:16.680
if they're in that space? And where are those users most likely to be? You know, are these

219
0:19:16.680 --> 0:19:21.480
users going to be at Fostem? Are they going to be at like, you know, open source summit?

220
0:19:21.480 --> 0:19:26.720
Are they going to be at KubeCon? I mean, like, where will you see these people pop up? And

221
0:19:26.720 --> 0:19:30.400
how do you ensure that you know where they are and what sort of things that they like

222
0:19:30.400 --> 0:19:35.360
and what sort of things that they need? And so you want to understand that really early

223
0:19:35.360 --> 0:19:41.520
on, even if you're not trying to monetize or commercialize the open source yet, you

224
0:19:41.520 --> 0:19:45.200
know, you want to keep that in the back of your mind and start to funnel things in that

225
0:19:45.200 --> 0:19:50.640
right direction. Now, the next key is to listen and ask questions.

226
0:19:50.640 --> 0:19:54.760
Now remember I said a big mistake people make is the founder builds the software specifically

227
0:19:54.760 --> 0:20:00.600
for themselves and they don't necessarily take into account other people in the ecosystem.

228
0:20:00.600 --> 0:20:06.920
And this is where product success is really determined based on your users and your potential

229
0:20:06.920 --> 0:20:11.240
users and listening to their needs. If you're not listening to their needs, you're going

230
0:20:11.240 --> 0:20:16.780
to be missing out on a lot of opportunity for growth. And that's where that mistake

231
0:20:16.780 --> 0:20:22.280
comes in. So avoid that if you can. The other one is you have to set a goal and

232
0:20:22.280 --> 0:20:28.000
focus on it. Be really good at a few things, not really okay at a lot of things because

233
0:20:28.000 --> 0:20:30.960
there's a lot of other software you might be competing with. There's a lot of other

234
0:20:30.960 --> 0:20:37.240
people who are potentially solving the same issues. And it's really easy to get distracted

235
0:20:37.240 --> 0:20:42.120
by shiny object syndrome. Anybody get distracted by shiny object syndrome? I'm like that all

236
0:20:42.120 --> 0:20:47.400
the time. Yeah, I see hands waving all the time. And that is so easy to do. In fact,

237
0:20:47.400 --> 0:20:52.560
I was just talking with Avi our CEO over here and we're talking about tracking webpage stuff

238
0:20:52.560 --> 0:20:56.160
and I'm like oh we can do that in our product. But we're like wait a minute, that's not our

239
0:20:56.160 --> 0:21:02.040
core product. Why would we go down that hole? But people do that a lot and when you do that

240
0:21:02.040 --> 0:21:06.080
it might be cool and you might learn that there's a new subset and there might be a

241
0:21:06.080 --> 0:21:12.320
time for expanding your product but until your core product has that established base

242
0:21:12.320 --> 0:21:20.720
you don't want to do that. So don't deviate too often. Stick to that original purpose.

243
0:21:20.720 --> 0:21:26.400
And if you do that you will eventually find that you become better known in the market.

244
0:21:26.400 --> 0:21:30.620
People are willing to talk about you, use you and then share additional contributions

245
0:21:30.620 --> 0:21:37.440
to maybe make your project a little better. Okay, this one's a big one. All right. Has

246
0:21:37.440 --> 0:21:43.480
to meet or exceed expectations. Now this totally seems obvious, right? But let's assume that

247
0:21:43.480 --> 0:21:48.200
I build a cell phone and my cell phone has the awesomest speakers, the awesomest music

248
0:21:48.200 --> 0:21:54.380
system and it is the best gaming platform ever but it can't take calls. Is it still

249
0:21:54.380 --> 0:22:00.120
a cell phone? If I market it as a cell phone, if I sell it as a cell phone, if I say oh

250
0:22:00.120 --> 0:22:05.920
this is my cell phone, it doesn't matter. It's not. So if I'm trying to build a cell

251
0:22:05.920 --> 0:22:10.880
phone but it is great at just music and gaming but it can't take a call I have not met the

252
0:22:10.880 --> 0:22:16.800
expectations of that. And that's where you need to figure out what are the table stakes

253
0:22:16.800 --> 0:22:24.120
for your project. What are the key ingredients? Whatever those are that's where you have to

254
0:22:24.120 --> 0:22:30.080
focus. And that means do the job that it was originally intended to do and meet some

255
0:22:30.080 --> 0:22:35.600
minimum standards. And there are minimum standards that we all have from an open source perspective.

256
0:22:35.600 --> 0:22:41.160
Okay. What are some of those minimum standards? Hey, you know what? It has to be secure, right?

257
0:22:41.160 --> 0:22:45.640
Like who wants an insecure piece of software nowadays? Well, we have too many of them.

258
0:22:45.640 --> 0:22:51.280
Let's not add any more. But it has to protect from data loss. I don't want leaky data. You

259
0:22:51.280 --> 0:22:55.760
know how much you know how many times my personal data's been leaked? My daughter's going to

260
0:22:55.760 --> 0:23:00.760
inherit free credit monitoring for the rest of her life because I've had so many data

261
0:23:00.760 --> 0:23:04.720
leaks. I mean, I think there's several Matt Yackovits running around right now. Maybe

262
0:23:04.720 --> 0:23:10.800
even at this conference. So, you know, it also has to be as bug free as possible. Now,

263
0:23:10.800 --> 0:23:16.520
while we strive, I'll strive for bug free software. We know it's not a viable thing.

264
0:23:16.520 --> 0:23:20.960
But shipping with known critical bugs is bad. And I know some companies who do it just to

265
0:23:20.960 --> 0:23:27.960
meet deadlines. It's not good. Next up is UI UX. Any UI UX guys? There are people on

266
0:23:30.520 --> 0:23:37.520
here. A few? Okay. Awesome. Oh, yes. Many, many. All right. Well, so it's like this.

267
0:23:37.840 --> 0:23:44.840
If your product is designed like this elevator, that's really confusing. Isn't it? I mean,

268
0:23:45.560 --> 0:23:50.840
UI UX is probably one of the most important things to get right. The user experience can

269
0:23:50.840 --> 0:23:57.480
ruin an awesome technical project. You can have the best technology out there, and if

270
0:23:57.480 --> 0:24:04.480
the user interface sucks, people won't use it. Or they'll use it once, which is even

271
0:24:04.480 --> 0:24:11.480
worse. So a bad user experience can ruin any benefits that you provide. GitHub is littered

272
0:24:12.680 --> 0:24:18.780
with projects like this, by the way. So of the millions and millions of projects that

273
0:24:18.780 --> 0:24:25.780
are out there, many of them fall victim to this, even if they are really solid. And if

274
0:24:25.840 --> 0:24:32.520
you want to grow your community and grow adoption, easy. Remember, easy was my point number three.

275
0:24:32.520 --> 0:24:37.720
You know, you need users who can be advanced if they want to and get into the weeds, but

276
0:24:37.720 --> 0:24:42.680
most of the users won't. And again, that gets back to that assumption that we build things

277
0:24:42.680 --> 0:24:48.200
for ourselves. A lot of CTOs, a lot of cofounders, a lot of people in this space, what they think

278
0:24:48.200 --> 0:24:52.720
is I'm super technical, and they are. They're building a company. Those out there in the

279
0:24:52.720 --> 0:24:57.640
space where founders, you know, at that executive level, maybe they're maintainers or projects,

280
0:24:57.640 --> 0:25:03.640
you are all brilliant. And that means that your brilliance probably exceeds your average

281
0:25:03.640 --> 0:25:10.640
users brilliance. That's okay. But keep that in mind. So make it easy for folks. And my

282
0:25:11.720 --> 0:25:16.800
product key number six is community. Open source projects need community. And we need

283
0:25:16.800 --> 0:25:22.960
to bake that in to the beginning. Okay. And that means including plans for fostering that

284
0:25:22.960 --> 0:25:29.640
strong community up front. Now, I brought this up. I was previewing my slides and someone,

285
0:25:29.640 --> 0:25:34.760
you know, said, wait a minute. What about curl? Does curl really have a strong community

286
0:25:34.760 --> 0:25:40.080
of contributors? Right? And this is what I say is we have to look beyond code. This isn't

287
0:25:40.080 --> 0:25:44.640
just about code. You want people who will use your product. And if you search for curl,

288
0:25:44.640 --> 0:25:50.320
for instance, you know, your favorite search engine, you're going to find thousands of

289
0:25:50.320 --> 0:25:56.280
examples of how to use curl. Right? You will. You can do it right now if you want. Tutorials,

290
0:25:56.280 --> 0:26:02.020
examples, cool things, hacks, whatever. That's community even if it's not code contributions.

291
0:26:02.020 --> 0:26:08.440
And that's what you need to continue that product growth. All right. Moving on. Now

292
0:26:08.440 --> 0:26:15.040
we're talking about how do we super charge the awareness? All righty. So let's talk specifically

293
0:26:15.040 --> 0:26:21.960
about community. Anybody here in the community space? Oh, a few people. Oh, yeah. Okay. Great.

294
0:26:21.960 --> 0:26:28.600
So this is the great hope for adoption in open source companies. In fact, a lot of people

295
0:26:28.600 --> 0:26:34.200
will prioritize a dev rel hire over any of the business hires because they want to start

296
0:26:34.200 --> 0:26:41.600
to connect directly with that community. Okay. And it's this is a balance, but the community

297
0:26:41.600 --> 0:26:48.280
can really help accelerate and drive that awareness if done right. But here's the thing.

298
0:26:48.280 --> 0:26:53.560
Okay. Community is starting to turn into the new marketing. For the last five years, the

299
0:26:53.560 --> 0:26:58.440
last ten years, marketing has often been in control of community. Community has been a

300
0:26:58.440 --> 0:27:04.920
subset of marketing, sometimes a subset of product. But ultimately, this shift in mindset

301
0:27:04.920 --> 0:27:11.560
where the community is so important and it's driving so many conversations, it's supplanting

302
0:27:11.560 --> 0:27:16.400
marketing. And there are reasons that you still need marketing. But in the future, I

303
0:27:16.400 --> 0:27:21.800
think that what we'll see is the community team has marketing as a function, not community

304
0:27:21.800 --> 0:27:27.200
as a function of marketing, which is a different way to think of it. And that's a real mind

305
0:27:27.200 --> 0:27:31.920
shift for a lot of people in the business space. But if we do approach this from a community

306
0:27:31.920 --> 0:27:38.560
first approach, we can accelerate and grow the open source space even faster. And that

307
0:27:38.560 --> 0:27:43.320
gets back to this expectation, right? So when we talk about that expectation, I mentioned

308
0:27:43.320 --> 0:27:48.520
earlier that funnel, the flywheel, you know, when we're talking about, hey, can we have

309
0:27:48.520 --> 0:27:53.620
people in the community who talk about us and then turn into followers of us who then

310
0:27:53.620 --> 0:27:58.360
continue to watch our things and then who continue to try and use our software in different

311
0:27:58.360 --> 0:28:04.120
ways. That's the ultimate outcome that we want. And when we talk about this community

312
0:28:04.120 --> 0:28:08.800
team, there's multiple functions in it. This is a chart that I've used several times before,

313
0:28:08.800 --> 0:28:13.240
but, you know, we're talking about dev rel or evangelism, we're talking about community

314
0:28:13.240 --> 0:28:17.480
management, we're talking about these Ospo roles with contributors. All of these things

315
0:28:17.480 --> 0:28:23.480
are part of a strong community team. All of them need to be satisfied. Now, a lot of us

316
0:28:23.480 --> 0:28:28.640
will focus only on evangelism and then they won't do the other functions. Or they'll focus

317
0:28:28.640 --> 0:28:33.240
only on the contributors and not do the other functions. And so all three of these are needed

318
0:28:33.240 --> 0:28:41.200
for a healthy, healthy ecosystem. Now, what are some popular ways to grow open source

319
0:28:41.200 --> 0:28:47.880
adoption? Okay. These are probably obvious for anybody who's been in the open source

320
0:28:47.880 --> 0:28:53.520
space for a while or been in the community, but they're classic, right? Content, number

321
0:28:53.520 --> 0:28:57.880
one, right? Content. Everybody loves content. The more relevant content that you have, the

322
0:28:57.880 --> 0:29:03.000
more code examples that you can share, the more conference talks that are relevant to

323
0:29:03.000 --> 0:29:09.000
people, the more blogs you write, you know, those will make a difference. Tutorial sample

324
0:29:09.000 --> 0:29:12.880
applications and whatnot. All of these things are things that are important to those in

325
0:29:12.880 --> 0:29:18.000
the community. There's other activities you can do, especially when your product solves

326
0:29:18.000 --> 0:29:24.080
something that's newsworthy. Has anybody heard of the term newsjacking? No? Okay. A couple

327
0:29:24.080 --> 0:29:28.480
people. It's the idea that, you know, if there's something in the news cycle like, you know,

328
0:29:28.480 --> 0:29:33.680
oh, the latest hack and, you know, or whatever, if there's an opportunity for you to maybe

329
0:29:33.680 --> 0:29:39.840
talk to people about how to build better products. If your product or your company does something

330
0:29:39.840 --> 0:29:45.880
differently that solves these other issues, this is a way for you to use the stories that

331
0:29:45.880 --> 0:29:50.880
are already out there to reach additional people. You know, if somebody's hacked or

332
0:29:50.880 --> 0:29:54.600
some cloud provider goes down, well, this is how we would prevent that, you know, or

333
0:29:54.600 --> 0:29:59.280
here's how our software did this differently. Those types of things actually can have a

334
0:29:59.280 --> 0:30:06.680
really far wide reach because those are things that are on top of people's minds. Now, you

335
0:30:06.680 --> 0:30:12.480
also need to generate friends telling friends, right? So that peer to peer connection, if

336
0:30:12.480 --> 0:30:18.160
you will, of people who are willing to share their experiences and share the different,

337
0:30:18.160 --> 0:30:24.120
you know, goodness of your software. And that goes hand in hand with some other things like

338
0:30:24.120 --> 0:30:33.160
good messaging and products and making it easier to start. Now, how do we make this

339
0:30:33.160 --> 0:30:42.240
easier? That's key. The first one is it requires a lot of collaboration. It's a choreographed

340
0:30:42.240 --> 0:30:50.040
dance. Okay? So making this easier is you have to have not only easier products to use,

341
0:30:50.040 --> 0:30:55.920
you not only need a great user experience, you also need to make sure that you have enough

342
0:30:55.920 --> 0:31:02.160
information, enough tutorials, enough example code, enough out there in the community activity

343
0:31:02.160 --> 0:31:07.760
to merge those together because you have to have good product as well as strong community

344
0:31:07.760 --> 0:31:16.000
as long as strong content, good documentation to make this work. And so that easy is important,

345
0:31:16.000 --> 0:31:20.520
but it goes beyond just one team's function. You know, and some of those key things or

346
0:31:20.520 --> 0:31:25.440
some of those things that I see people sometimes stumble with or sometimes fall down on are

347
0:31:25.440 --> 0:31:32.400
things like installation. You know, so how easy it is to install and get started. Same

348
0:31:32.400 --> 0:31:37.120
defaults. How many people have installed software and it's like how did you not set that up?

349
0:31:37.120 --> 0:31:42.480
Like why isn't that defaulted to on? You know, like encryption. Oh, encryption is just left

350
0:31:42.480 --> 0:31:47.320
off by default. Or my favorite is, and I don't even know if maybe there's somebody here who's

351
0:31:47.320 --> 0:31:51.200
run Mongo recently, but they used to not set a default password because they're like, oh,

352
0:31:51.200 --> 0:31:55.840
you don't want to limit people from getting started. Well, how can you not set a default

353
0:31:55.840 --> 0:32:01.760
password? By the way, that's the number one reason MongoDB has like data leaks. You know,

354
0:32:01.760 --> 0:32:05.440
you read these articles and it's like, oh, because these old, you know, these old installations

355
0:32:05.440 --> 0:32:10.560
didn't set a password. I don't consider that a security issue. That's more of a user issue,

356
0:32:10.560 --> 0:32:17.040
but that's a whole other story. How much automation do you put in place to help users? That's

357
0:32:17.040 --> 0:32:23.920
another critical one. Again, UI, UX, and how easy it is to debug problems. You know, if

358
0:32:23.920 --> 0:32:28.240
your problems, if the software crashes or has an issue or doesn't work as expected,

359
0:32:28.240 --> 0:32:32.080
do you have the right debugging in place for people to actually find what's wrong and fix

360
0:32:32.080 --> 0:32:37.400
it? Because if not, that's going to cause a really, really, really hard time in getting

361
0:32:37.400 --> 0:32:46.640
people to operationalize it. So we talked about, you know, kick ass product.

362
0:32:46.640 --> 0:32:52.480
We talked about, you know, the awareness. We talked about, you know, how to make it

363
0:32:52.480 --> 0:32:58.520
easy. Now I got to put on my other hat. I do have another hat. It's my metrics hat.

364
0:32:58.520 --> 0:33:03.560
I got to wear my metrics hat for my metrics section of this. So we're going to talk about

365
0:33:03.560 --> 0:33:11.320
how do we track open source usage and adoption now. Okay. And there's really kind of four

366
0:33:11.320 --> 0:33:18.240
or five major functions that I want to talk through. Awareness, usage, conversion, customers,

367
0:33:18.240 --> 0:33:23.240
and retention. Okay. And this kind of follows that funnel and that flywheel that we talked

368
0:33:23.240 --> 0:33:28.160
about originally. This is one of those things that, you know, each one of these requires

369
0:33:28.160 --> 0:33:31.680
a certain set of things to potentially look at. You don't have to look at all of these,

370
0:33:31.680 --> 0:33:35.420
but these are metrics that you should all consider and then pick and choose which ones

371
0:33:35.420 --> 0:33:41.000
make the most sense for your business. But when we talk about awareness, okay, a lot

372
0:33:41.000 --> 0:33:46.280
of people start with the first one on this list. So how many people track GitHub stars?

373
0:33:46.280 --> 0:33:52.120
Okay. Hey, you know, GitHub stars are a popularity contest, by the way. Did you know that? Like,

374
0:33:52.120 --> 0:33:57.960
it really is. Because it actually doesn't really show much other than people like your

375
0:33:57.960 --> 0:34:02.760
project or maybe they like people on your project. And did you know that for only $5.99

376
0:34:02.760 --> 0:34:08.360
I can get you a thousand stars on GitHub? There are services that do that. And so I

377
0:34:08.360 --> 0:34:15.840
don't know how many of the stars are actually real or not in some cases. It's hard to tell.

378
0:34:15.840 --> 0:34:19.180
But you should be looking at that because if it is going up and to the right and you're

379
0:34:19.180 --> 0:34:24.160
not gaming the system, that is a good indication that people are finding your project. But

380
0:34:24.160 --> 0:34:30.200
keep in mind from a project perspective, there are more users than there are users who will

381
0:34:30.200 --> 0:34:35.800
go to your GitHub page and get into your repository. And that's something to consider. Unless you're

382
0:34:35.800 --> 0:34:42.160
forcing people to go and install, you know, via source or your documentation is on GitHub,

383
0:34:42.160 --> 0:34:46.000
you might have more people who are downloading some other mechanism. Maybe they're getting

384
0:34:46.000 --> 0:34:49.640
from a third party repo. Maybe they're just going to your website and getting it. So they

385
0:34:49.640 --> 0:34:56.040
might never go star or even see your GitHub pages. But looking at not only GitHub pages,

386
0:34:56.040 --> 0:35:01.400
but your traffic to your docs, your website, your different pieces of content and understanding

387
0:35:01.400 --> 0:35:06.280
who is interacting with it, that's another critical piece to this. And that's a classic

388
0:35:06.280 --> 0:35:10.480
marketing thing. A lot of people look at, you know, the website traffic. But you also

389
0:35:10.480 --> 0:35:16.080
want to look at those unique views to each individual page. All of those are critical

390
0:35:16.080 --> 0:35:25.600
to look at. Now, what's interesting when we talk about page views is we've had conversations

391
0:35:25.600 --> 0:35:30.060
with folks who talk about page views and they're like, there are certain pages that don't matter

392
0:35:30.060 --> 0:35:35.580
and then there are certain pages that do. And so understanding and being able to segment

393
0:35:35.580 --> 0:35:40.560
your traffic and look at who is looking at what is a very important thing to understanding

394
0:35:40.560 --> 0:35:45.480
that growth and adoption. So, for instance, if someone looks at your pricing page, that's

395
0:35:45.480 --> 0:35:49.440
probably a good indicator that they might be interested in something commercial. If

396
0:35:49.440 --> 0:35:53.100
someone is looking at your documentation, that's a pretty good indicator that they're

397
0:35:53.100 --> 0:35:57.800
trying to install or debug an issue. If they're looking at tutorials on how to get started,

398
0:35:57.800 --> 0:36:02.440
that's a very good indication that, again, they're trying to use your software. And so

399
0:36:02.440 --> 0:36:08.080
you can track adoption through looking at those types of things. Now, when we talk about

400
0:36:08.080 --> 0:36:13.080
external evangelists and trying to get additional people into the ecosystem to talk about you

401
0:36:13.080 --> 0:36:17.400
or to figure out, like, what you're doing or, you know, maybe, you know, get excited

402
0:36:17.400 --> 0:36:21.960
about your product, looking at the referrals to the website is another really good example.

403
0:36:21.960 --> 0:36:28.280
So I can see your blog or your blog pointed back to my website or your social tweet mentioned

404
0:36:28.280 --> 0:36:36.920
me. These referrals are often more critical than the website traffic on itself. Now, there's

405
0:36:36.920 --> 0:36:41.040
also two concepts that are really squishy. I won't get into a terrible amount of details

406
0:36:41.040 --> 0:36:47.000
if you're really interested. Check out opensourcemetrics.com or.org. But share a voice. Have you heard

407
0:36:47.000 --> 0:36:53.560
a share a voice before? No? Okay. Think of share a voice is how often does the project

408
0:36:53.560 --> 0:36:58.320
or the thing come into people's minds or how often does it show up in search? How much

409
0:36:58.320 --> 0:37:05.680
of the market do you have? So, for instance, if I was to say to you, like, you know, when

410
0:37:05.680 --> 0:37:11.400
I say Linux, what pops into your mind? Like, what distribution pops into your mind? I'm

411
0:37:11.400 --> 0:37:17.240
going to guess most of you are probably going to say one of, like, three or four. But there's

412
0:37:17.240 --> 0:37:22.000
lots of other ones. And so those three or four have a higher share of voice than everyone

413
0:37:22.000 --> 0:37:27.680
else. And so if you can measure how much of your share of voices, then you know how much

414
0:37:27.680 --> 0:37:31.360
of the market you potentially, you know, can reach out. And then when you have something

415
0:37:31.360 --> 0:37:35.720
to say, people are going to potentially listen. And then there's this idea of social reach.

416
0:37:35.720 --> 0:37:40.920
Now, probably everyone here has different social accounts on different platforms. And

417
0:37:40.920 --> 0:37:45.480
it's awesome. And the question is how much of a reach do you have? And this is, you know,

418
0:37:45.480 --> 0:37:50.120
measured by the number of followers, the amount of engagement. And the reason you want a larger

419
0:37:50.120 --> 0:37:53.800
social reach from an awareness standpoint is when you do have an announcement, when

420
0:37:53.800 --> 0:37:57.880
you launch a new product, when you talk about a new release, when you do have something

421
0:37:57.880 --> 0:38:06.000
important to say, this helps amplify that voice. Now, from a usage perspective, usage

422
0:38:06.000 --> 0:38:13.600
is where the adoption really comes into play here. Okay. Usage is how many people are actually

423
0:38:13.600 --> 0:38:21.320
using your software? All right. Now, I know a lot of companies have struggled with usage

424
0:38:21.320 --> 0:38:26.600
on the open source side. There's a lot of times people come back and they ask the question,

425
0:38:26.600 --> 0:38:32.000
well, who's using our open source software? And the answer a lot of times is, I don't

426
0:38:32.000 --> 0:38:37.000
know, you know, certain number of people, this number of people hit the download webpage.

427
0:38:37.000 --> 0:38:40.160
But there's so many different places to get, you know, that information. I can't really

428
0:38:40.160 --> 0:38:44.920
get it. But some people can get raw download numbers. Anybody look at download numbers

429
0:38:44.920 --> 0:38:51.320
for their software? A few? Okay. It's hard to get. It really is. Especially when you're

430
0:38:51.320 --> 0:38:55.400
looking at, you know, I deploy via Docker. Some people are doing source. Some people

431
0:38:55.400 --> 0:39:02.800
have packages. So that is a challenge. But it's important to understand if there are

432
0:39:02.800 --> 0:39:07.840
more people downloading, that's good. But you have to be careful. Because a lot, I'm

433
0:39:07.840 --> 0:39:12.240
going to tell you a secret. There are a lot of bots on the Internet. I don't know if you

434
0:39:12.240 --> 0:39:18.080
knew that. Don't tell anybody. And those bots download stuff. In fact, what we've found

435
0:39:18.080 --> 0:39:23.360
is a lot of times we might have a project. And so one of the things that I mentioned

436
0:39:23.360 --> 0:39:29.760
that SCARF does is it tracks, you know, things like downloads and download metrics. But what

437
0:39:29.760 --> 0:39:35.560
we found was stuff like, oh, this project has, you know, 50,000 downloads a month from

438
0:39:35.560 --> 0:39:40.280
two people. It's like, well, wait a minute. There's only two people actually downloading.

439
0:39:40.280 --> 0:39:44.800
So when you see 50,000 downloads, but you see only like two unique people, you're like,

440
0:39:44.800 --> 0:39:48.080
well, what is that? And then you dig into it and it's some bot that's downloading it

441
0:39:48.080 --> 0:39:53.040
and distributing it some other way. So that's important to realize that that is something

442
0:39:53.040 --> 0:39:57.000
that can happen. You want to look at that. But you want to look at that scrubbed unique

443
0:39:57.000 --> 0:40:02.360
download. So how many people are actually downloading versus how many people are, you

444
0:40:02.360 --> 0:40:06.480
know, just downloading and it could be bots or duplications. A lot of companies download

445
0:40:06.480 --> 0:40:11.240
the same software over and over again. A lot of people in their pipelines will download

446
0:40:11.240 --> 0:40:17.800
the latest version of software, et cetera. New users, new companies coming into the ecosystem.

447
0:40:17.800 --> 0:40:22.320
That's really important for usage. Signups. So if you are a SAS provider, you're offering

448
0:40:22.320 --> 0:40:27.680
a free trial. Maybe you have a webinar, maybe you have a mailing list, maybe you have Slack.

449
0:40:27.680 --> 0:40:30.920
Signups are another thing that you want to track for usage, but that's not necessarily

450
0:40:30.920 --> 0:40:35.640
going to correlate to actual usage of the open source. But again, that's more of a directionally

451
0:40:35.640 --> 0:40:42.520
correct up into the right. You know, so the one that is really on the bottom here, the

452
0:40:42.520 --> 0:40:52.760
last four, this one's sticky. This one's tough for me. Call home metrics. So most of the

453
0:40:52.760 --> 0:40:58.600
people in the open source space hate the concept of anything that's going to call home. It's

454
0:40:58.600 --> 0:41:05.520
not necessarily always welcome, but there's a certain amount that might be needed for

455
0:41:05.520 --> 0:41:10.800
projects. And the question is, where is that line? And when I talk about call home metrics,

456
0:41:10.800 --> 0:41:15.520
is something running? Is it installed? Is it available? How many things are running at

457
0:41:15.520 --> 0:41:20.960
any one time? These are critical questions that a lot of projects struggle with. Just

458
0:41:20.960 --> 0:41:25.400
because even if you have a download doesn't necessarily mean that download actually translated

459
0:41:25.400 --> 0:41:30.040
into an actual user. And so you want to make sure that you can go back and forth between,

460
0:41:30.040 --> 0:41:34.320
yeah, they downloaded, but they stopped using. Because if they downloaded and stopped using

461
0:41:34.320 --> 0:41:38.680
or never actually use it on a regular basis, that's a very different thing than someone

462
0:41:38.680 --> 0:41:45.000
who's just downloaded and you assume that they're using it.

463
0:41:45.000 --> 0:41:49.600
Now before we get into conversions, I want to say that just because you have adoption

464
0:41:49.600 --> 0:41:55.000
of your open source software doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to lead to commercial

465
0:41:55.000 --> 0:42:00.120
success. Okay? How many people, I mean, there might be some people in here, and maybe you're

466
0:42:00.120 --> 0:42:03.720
willing to raise your hand, but I know that several people that I've talked to struggle

467
0:42:03.720 --> 0:42:09.080
with this, where they're like, I have a million downloads a month, but I can't get anybody

468
0:42:09.080 --> 0:42:17.280
to buy anything from me. You know? Oh yeah, there we go. We have one brave soul. That

469
0:42:17.280 --> 0:42:21.920
happens quite a bit. And it gets back to some of those product things, and there's a lot

470
0:42:21.920 --> 0:42:27.660
of reasons or things that you can do to try and change that. But it gets back to this

471
0:42:27.660 --> 0:42:34.880
expectations on the awareness versus what the business expects. And from a metric standpoint,

472
0:42:34.880 --> 0:42:38.680
you've got the two sides, right? So when you talk about the community side, the adoption

473
0:42:38.680 --> 0:42:46.160
of open source side, a lot of times our efforts are around fostering that really strong community.

474
0:42:46.160 --> 0:42:49.240
And then there's this big question mark in the middle, and then on the business side,

475
0:42:49.240 --> 0:42:54.280
then there's, oh, now we want ARR. Now we want to look at expansion numbers and churn

476
0:42:54.280 --> 0:42:59.040
and all this other stuff. So how do you bridge the gap between these two? And this is where

477
0:42:59.040 --> 0:43:04.840
conversion comes into play. And conversion's a bad word for people, right? You know, yeah,

478
0:43:04.840 --> 0:43:10.440
you will be assimilated. You know, we want that from the open source side, right? It

479
0:43:10.440 --> 0:43:16.160
might be a negative connotation, but I think it's funny. But I do have a super evil little

480
0:43:16.160 --> 0:43:21.920
hat. So, but you do want those conversion metrics. You want people to say, okay, what

481
0:43:21.920 --> 0:43:28.920
does it take to go from free to paid? And to measure that, okay, there's different

482
0:43:28.920 --> 0:43:33.200
things to look at, right? That conversion is impacted by a lot of different things,

483
0:43:33.200 --> 0:43:37.400
and each one of these are things you can measure from a product. You know, you want better

484
0:43:37.400 --> 0:43:44.320
features, better security, you know, you want support, things like that. From a policy perspective,

485
0:43:44.320 --> 0:43:48.320
you know, companies often will require support or they might have compliance requirements,

486
0:43:48.320 --> 0:43:52.640
so how do you meet them? And then people, right? So all these things affect your conversion

487
0:43:52.640 --> 0:43:57.600
ratios. But looking at conversion ratios you can actually control, you want to look at

488
0:43:57.600 --> 0:44:03.400
things like page docs or source to download conversion ratios, doc views to those who

489
0:44:03.400 --> 0:44:07.760
have downloaded, to those who eventually signed up, if you can track that, that's great.

490
0:44:07.760 --> 0:44:13.960
I know that in the past I've had to go through and do stuff like that where I've seen, I

491
0:44:13.960 --> 0:44:19.000
mean, actual example where it's like company A, this really large company, four years ago

492
0:44:19.000 --> 0:44:25.320
started looking at our blogs. And then they attended conferences, they did all this other

493
0:44:25.320 --> 0:44:29.800
stuff, and then two years they called us up and had a conversation, and then a year later

494
0:44:29.800 --> 0:44:35.040
they did something else. So there are breadcrumbs when you look that you can actually see what

495
0:44:35.040 --> 0:44:42.160
people are doing and what sort of activities help lead them to be a customer. Now, customers,

496
0:44:42.160 --> 0:44:46.160
when we talk about customer metrics, we're talking about standard business metrics. So

497
0:44:46.160 --> 0:44:49.640
these are the ones that most people who are running an open source company are familiar

498
0:44:49.640 --> 0:44:57.200
with. The critical ones, things like the number of new customers or new logos, ARR, MRR, you

499
0:44:57.200 --> 0:45:02.000
know, stuff like that. So I'm not going to go terribly deep into this because there are

500
0:45:02.000 --> 0:45:07.240
MBA courses that cover a lot of these and I don't want to necessarily go in depth. But

501
0:45:07.240 --> 0:45:12.360
the ones that I look at typically, the big three, number of customers, number of new logos,

502
0:45:12.360 --> 0:45:20.640
and yeah, the ARR, MRR. And then also I look at the user to customer ratio. So if you know

503
0:45:20.640 --> 0:45:27.880
you have a million users and you have only five paying customers, how do you adjust that?

504
0:45:27.880 --> 0:45:32.720
How do you tweak it? How do you make that work better? And then I also look at the number

505
0:45:32.720 --> 0:45:39.000
of customers who are also advocating for us. From a retention and churn perspective, churn

506
0:45:39.000 --> 0:45:43.640
is the idea that people start using and then go away. So you want to look at those, you

507
0:45:43.640 --> 0:45:48.080
want to look at the number of instances that have gone away. You also want to do some competitive

508
0:45:48.080 --> 0:45:52.800
analysis, right? So if you have users and customers who are starting to use other open

509
0:45:52.800 --> 0:45:59.960
source projects or take a look at other things, you might want to be aware of that. So recapping,

510
0:45:59.960 --> 0:46:05.960
not all businesses, open source businesses are the same. Realistically build an awesome

511
0:46:05.960 --> 0:46:10.360
project, focus on the funnel and of course measure it. All of these things will help

512
0:46:10.360 --> 0:46:15.760
lead you to open source success. Again, if you are interested in getting more details

513
0:46:15.760 --> 0:46:19.360
about any of the metrics or learning a little bit about what's been successful for other

514
0:46:19.360 --> 0:46:24.440
folks, check out open source metrics.org. You can contribute to it if you think that

515
0:46:24.440 --> 0:46:29.520
there is something that is missing, something that you think we should work better, definitions,

516
0:46:29.520 --> 0:46:35.600
et cetera. We would love to have your feedback and help there. Details if you want to reach

517
0:46:35.600 --> 0:46:43.600
out to me. Be happy to have conversations with anybody offline. And that is it for me.

518
0:46:43.600 --> 0:46:58.800
Questions? Oh, we got one question. Oh, two. We're running mics to people. We're running

519
0:46:58.800 --> 0:47:14.160
mics to people in the crowd, it looks like. Oh, it's not working. Ah, okay. Well, maybe

520
0:47:14.160 --> 0:47:22.960
you should shout. Maybe now. You mentioned collecting metrics from users, but because

521
0:47:22.960 --> 0:47:29.040
of the GDPR you need informed consent that you're allowed to collect metrics. In your

522
0:47:29.040 --> 0:47:32.800
experience, what's the percentage of users that actually allow to do that? Is it like

523
0:47:32.800 --> 0:47:38.920
1% or 10%? It's generally more than you would think. I mean, it's at least a third, maybe

524
0:47:38.920 --> 0:47:49.840
more. And beyond that, there are metrics that aren't tied to PII that can show those indicators

525
0:47:49.840 --> 0:47:56.360
going up and to the right. Just because you know that you have web page traffic or downloads,

526
0:47:56.360 --> 0:48:00.080
even if you don't know specifically who they are, you can still see those up and to the

527
0:48:00.080 --> 0:48:03.220
right and those are just as important in a lot of cases. And that's why you have to pick

528
0:48:03.220 --> 0:48:08.000
and choose which ones make the most sense. And in a lot of cases, what it is is it's

529
0:48:08.000 --> 0:48:13.920
about building that community and that relationship so they're willing to share details. And how

530
0:48:13.920 --> 0:48:20.400
you do that and how you make sure is you don't do old slimy sales tactics. You don't want

531
0:48:20.400 --> 0:48:24.280
to spam people. You don't want to call them. Look, let people raise their hand when they're

532
0:48:24.280 --> 0:48:29.920
ready and that helps people a lot. And when people go to bat for you and tell other people,

533
0:48:29.920 --> 0:48:32.800
hey, you should sign up for the newsletter. You should sign up for this. And then they

534
0:48:32.800 --> 0:48:39.760
give you that consent. That helps a lot. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, other way. Other way. Yeah. All

535
0:48:39.760 --> 0:48:49.160
right. We had a couple more questions. We've got one in the middle, one in the end, one

536
0:48:49.160 --> 0:49:02.120
down here. Hello. Yes. Okay. So I was one of the folks that raised their hands when

537
0:49:02.120 --> 0:49:07.240
you asked what are we know, open core. So I don't, but then you started explaining and

538
0:49:07.240 --> 0:49:11.600
I say, okay, that's like Freeman. So I just was asking, could you explain the difference

539
0:49:11.600 --> 0:49:18.280
between open core and freemium? Ah, so yeah. So freemium is where, you know, your first

540
0:49:18.280 --> 0:49:24.800
taste is free and then, you know, you can, you can get more later on. Open core has been

541
0:49:24.800 --> 0:49:30.960
a lot around a lot longer than quote unquote freemium. Okay. And typically from a freemium

542
0:49:30.960 --> 0:49:36.920
strategy, you're going to pay more as you go. Um, and so having like a cloud service where

543
0:49:36.920 --> 0:49:41.200
the first, let's say a hundred gigs of data or something that you store is free and then

544
0:49:41.200 --> 0:49:45.240
it goes on, that's more of that freemium strategy. But from an open source perspective, how I

545
0:49:45.240 --> 0:49:49.720
view open core is you've got a complete product that's running. You don't have to pay for

546
0:49:49.720 --> 0:49:54.200
anything. And if you wanted to augment it or change it on your own, you can. I think

547
0:49:54.200 --> 0:49:59.880
freemium typically comes in my mind and more into play on the cloud side where you've got

548
0:49:59.880 --> 0:50:03.000
more of that, you know, kind of like ongoing service where you're paying for something

549
0:50:03.000 --> 0:50:07.720
where you can't necessarily replace it or pull it out. But it's a fine line and it's

550
0:50:07.720 --> 0:50:13.000
really difficult to draw that line and a lot of people might go back and forth. Oh, it

551
0:50:13.000 --> 0:50:16.200
looks like our time is up. I'm happy to answer your question if you want to come down and

552
0:50:16.200 --> 0:50:21.080
we can, we can chat afterwards. That's cool. I appreciate your time. Um, I do. Thank you

553
0:50:21.080 --> 0:50:30.200
very much.
