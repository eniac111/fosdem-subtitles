0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:16.560
So, my talk is about modifying the Rust compiler to support Cherry's hardware capabilities.

2
0:00:16.560 --> 0:00:18.880
I'm going to start off with a brief introduction.

3
0:00:18.880 --> 0:00:23.240
My name is Lewis Revel and I work for a company called Ember Cosm.

4
0:00:23.240 --> 0:00:28.400
I work on many things, but I'd say I specialize in developing LLVM backends for constrained

5
0:00:28.400 --> 0:00:31.840
or unusual architectures.

6
0:00:31.840 --> 0:00:35.360
Ember Cosm itself is a software services company.

7
0:00:35.360 --> 0:00:40.040
We operate in the boundary between hardware and software, particularly in the embedded

8
0:00:40.040 --> 0:00:48.920
space where you can find many unusual, difficult and interesting problems like writing compilers.

9
0:00:48.920 --> 0:00:50.320
So what is Cherry?

10
0:00:50.320 --> 0:00:54.040
It's an acronym capability hardware enhanced Rust instructions.

11
0:00:54.040 --> 0:00:58.560
It's best described as an instruction set extension which can be adapted and applied

12
0:00:58.560 --> 0:01:00.720
to different architectures.

13
0:01:00.720 --> 0:01:06.120
The main feature of Cherry is that you can encode access constraints on memory addresses

14
0:01:06.120 --> 0:01:09.560
using things called capabilities.

15
0:01:09.560 --> 0:01:15.720
Capabilities essentially have metadata alongside memory addresses that allow you to specify

16
0:01:15.720 --> 0:01:19.160
these access constraints.

17
0:01:19.160 --> 0:01:25.280
These can only be operated on using capability operations which replace the normal pointer

18
0:01:25.280 --> 0:01:26.600
operations.

19
0:01:26.600 --> 0:01:32.920
These operations utilize the metadata to enforce those access constraints.

20
0:01:32.920 --> 0:01:36.840
It's worth pointing out there are two modes of operation for Cherry.

21
0:01:36.840 --> 0:01:41.720
There's pure cap mode where all pointers are capabilities.

22
0:01:41.720 --> 0:01:48.120
In hybrid mode, you have pointers by default on normal pointers, but capabilities are annotated

23
0:01:48.120 --> 0:01:51.280
as such in the source code.

24
0:01:51.280 --> 0:01:57.640
So capabilities together with capability operations allow you to enforce spatial, referential

25
0:01:57.640 --> 0:02:02.280
and temporal safety in the hardware at run time.

26
0:02:02.280 --> 0:02:09.160
Spatial safety is to do with disallowing accesses out of bounds of an original allocation.

27
0:02:09.160 --> 0:02:15.200
Referential safety is disallowing accesses without valid provenance.

28
0:02:15.200 --> 0:02:20.520
Temporal safety means that if the lifetime of an object is over, you can no longer access

29
0:02:20.520 --> 0:02:25.320
it through a capability.

30
0:02:25.320 --> 0:02:27.480
What about integrating Cherry and Rust?

31
0:02:27.480 --> 0:02:32.600
We're working on this as part of a project led by our customer, CyberHive.

32
0:02:32.600 --> 0:02:37.880
They're funded in turn by Digital Security by Design, which is a UK government initiative.

33
0:02:37.880 --> 0:02:45.440
CyberHive wants to use Cherry hardware to enhance secure network protocols that are

34
0:02:45.440 --> 0:02:46.600
written in Rust.

35
0:02:46.600 --> 0:02:51.160
The goal for us is to produce a Rust compiler that's capable of targeting Cherry-based

36
0:02:51.160 --> 0:02:52.160
architectures.

37
0:02:52.160 --> 0:02:57.400
With the long-term goal of a stable compiler that can produce production-ready code for

38
0:02:57.400 --> 0:02:59.360
security purposes.

39
0:02:59.360 --> 0:03:06.720
We know that we're initially going to be targeting Arm's Morello platform.

40
0:03:06.720 --> 0:03:11.400
Rather than being able to compile existing Rust code for Cherry, what's the motivation

41
0:03:11.400 --> 0:03:15.200
between integrating Cherry and Rust?

42
0:03:15.200 --> 0:03:19.000
Essentially it boils down to another layer of protection.

43
0:03:19.000 --> 0:03:26.160
We know that Rust is good at identifying and enforcing access constraints at compile time.

44
0:03:26.160 --> 0:03:30.480
With Cherry you can identify constraints at compile time and enforce them in hardware

45
0:03:30.480 --> 0:03:32.760
at run time.

46
0:03:32.760 --> 0:03:38.800
A good example is that Rust code annotated with unsafe is often a necessity in many real

47
0:03:38.800 --> 0:03:46.480
world projects, which means that it could behave badly but we don't know until run time.

48
0:03:46.480 --> 0:03:52.320
With Cherry you can prevent this bad behavior in hardware when it occurs at run time.

49
0:03:52.320 --> 0:03:56.800
There's some other small side benefits such as replacing slow software bounds checks with

50
0:03:56.800 --> 0:04:06.160
hardware bounds checking and replacing pointer plus length types with Cherry capabilities.

51
0:04:06.160 --> 0:04:10.720
To make things more clear I have a motivating example.

52
0:04:10.720 --> 0:04:16.400
Say we want to add a dynamic offset to a pointer and then load from that pointer.

53
0:04:16.400 --> 0:04:21.040
This needs to be done in an unsafe block because we don't know until run time if it's going

54
0:04:21.040 --> 0:04:23.120
to do something bad.

55
0:04:23.120 --> 0:04:29.360
Without Cherry you could end up accessing out of range of your original allocated array.

56
0:04:29.360 --> 0:04:34.920
With Cherry that access will not occur at run time and the hardware will either panic

57
0:04:34.920 --> 0:04:42.760
or give you something, a default value.

58
0:04:42.760 --> 0:04:48.000
Now that we know that we want these benefits, how do we go about modifying Rust to get them?

59
0:04:48.000 --> 0:04:53.040
The main problem is that we need to account for capability sizes correctly.

60
0:04:53.040 --> 0:04:57.840
That is we need to stop assuming that pointer type size is equal to the addressable range

61
0:04:57.840 --> 0:04:59.880
of the pointer.

62
0:04:59.880 --> 0:05:04.560
Because capabilities have metadata this isn't the case.

63
0:05:04.560 --> 0:05:12.920
Also in LLVM, in the Cherry LLVM fork, capabilities are pointers in address space 200 whereas

64
0:05:12.920 --> 0:05:19.200
in Rust we assume that all pointers to data are in address space zero.

65
0:05:19.200 --> 0:05:23.520
Also if we want to support hybrid mode we need to be able to specify different pointer

66
0:05:23.520 --> 0:05:26.920
type sizes for different address spaces.

67
0:05:26.920 --> 0:05:33.660
So address space zero will have different sizes from address space 200.

68
0:05:33.660 --> 0:05:38.520
One thing I hope doesn't require many changes is that we need provenance and bounds to be

69
0:05:38.520 --> 0:05:43.360
propagated through the compiler because they need to be attached to capabilities.

70
0:05:43.360 --> 0:05:49.920
And of course if we want the optional bonus stuff we need to implement that as well.

71
0:05:49.920 --> 0:05:50.920
Progress so far.

72
0:05:50.920 --> 0:05:57.040
So the data layout changes are completed which means that we can correctly specify capability

73
0:05:57.040 --> 0:06:05.160
sizes, both the type size and the addressable range for both pure cap and hybrid mode.

74
0:06:05.160 --> 0:06:10.880
I have modified APIs which produce pointer types to get rid of the assumption that pointers

75
0:06:10.880 --> 0:06:18.280
are in address space zero and now these APIs require an explicit address space parameter.

76
0:06:18.280 --> 0:06:25.160
And the biggest change is that for APIs where we have a where we report a size for a type

77
0:06:25.160 --> 0:06:32.960
this is replaced with a total type size and a size of the value that you can represent.

78
0:06:32.960 --> 0:06:40.640
And yeah, this means that like I said before we can support cherry capabilities.

79
0:06:40.640 --> 0:06:46.920
There's also in the strict provenance API there is an explicit unsafe method of producing

80
0:06:46.920 --> 0:06:53.520
pointers with no provenance from a U size.

81
0:06:53.520 --> 0:06:59.040
And for cherry we need to use cherry operations to set the address of a null capability to

82
0:06:59.040 --> 0:07:01.560
achieve the same result.

83
0:07:01.560 --> 0:07:05.480
What I'm currently working through is trawling through assertion failures that come up when

84
0:07:05.480 --> 0:07:11.600
building the core libraries with this modified compiler.

85
0:07:11.600 --> 0:07:12.840
What still needs to be done?

86
0:07:12.840 --> 0:07:17.680
Well there's almost definitely going to be modifications to the libraries to remove any

87
0:07:17.680 --> 0:07:21.720
assumptions that break for cherry.

88
0:07:21.720 --> 0:07:26.960
There's also the question of how do we specify capability types in hybrid mode?

89
0:07:26.960 --> 0:07:33.760
And because I don't think that Rust annotations are the right tool to specify a specific pointer

90
0:07:33.760 --> 0:07:39.160
as being a capability I think this requires a library solution.

91
0:07:39.160 --> 0:07:45.800
For APIs where I have replaced a size with a type size and added a size of the value

92
0:07:45.800 --> 0:07:51.840
that you can represent we need to go through all of those uses of the type size and see

93
0:07:51.840 --> 0:07:54.680
if they should really be using the size of the value that you can represent.

94
0:07:54.680 --> 0:08:01.320
Because this is the main cause of the errors that I'm seeing in building the libraries.

95
0:08:01.320 --> 0:08:07.760
And of course a lot of testing and polishing is going to be required.

96
0:08:07.760 --> 0:08:12.320
Before I finish the talk I do need to mention that there's ongoing and past work that is

97
0:08:12.320 --> 0:08:13.320
in this same area.

98
0:08:13.320 --> 0:08:18.200
There was a master's thesis from the University of Cambridge and there's another government

99
0:08:18.200 --> 0:08:22.880
funded project from the University of Kent.

100
0:08:22.880 --> 0:08:25.080
And thank you for listening.

101
0:08:25.080 --> 0:08:28.680
Please feel free to check out the code on GitHub or ask me any questions outside.

102
0:08:28.680 --> 0:08:53.680
Thank you.
