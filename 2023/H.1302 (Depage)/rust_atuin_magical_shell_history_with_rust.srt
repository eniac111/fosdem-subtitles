0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.900
Hey, everyone, and welcome to my talk, keeping history in sync with turtles and magic or

2
0:00:11.900 --> 0:00:16.960
the same shell history everywhere. I'm going to be talking to you today about a project

3
0:00:16.960 --> 0:00:23.560
I've been building on and off for the last two years or so. To get started, who am I?

4
0:00:23.560 --> 0:00:29.080
My name is Ellie and I'm the lead infrastructure engineer at a company called PostHog. When

5
0:00:29.080 --> 0:00:33.400
I'm not writing software for work, I try and maintain a couple of side projects in my free

6
0:00:33.400 --> 0:00:38.040
time. When I don't have the energy for that, I'm normally exploring outdoors, which, as

7
0:00:38.040 --> 0:00:43.920
you can probably see, is usually on a motorbike for me. To dive into a tune, first of all,

8
0:00:43.920 --> 0:00:49.600
I'm going to start with the name. Originally, it was called shink for shell and sync, but

9
0:00:49.600 --> 0:00:55.240
I couldn't really say that out loud without cringing. I looked at something new. I've

10
0:00:55.240 --> 0:01:00.520
been a fan of terry pratchett's disc world books for a really long time. For those who

11
0:01:00.520 --> 0:01:06.200
are unfamiliar, the premise there is that the world is a disc and it rests on the shoulders

12
0:01:06.200 --> 0:01:11.120
of four giant elephants stood on the shell of a space turtle called the great attun,

13
0:01:11.120 --> 0:01:16.240
which I'm probably mispronouncing. I thought it would be a bit pretentious to include the

14
0:01:16.240 --> 0:01:21.000
words the great in my project name and putting an apostrophe in a binary is probably not

15
0:01:21.000 --> 0:01:28.520
a good idea. I ended up with the name attun. A little bit more specifically, attun was

16
0:01:28.520 --> 0:01:34.520
made to synchronize shell history between multiple computers. I had the problem that

17
0:01:34.520 --> 0:01:39.080
I would be switching between a whole bunch of laptops, I would be remoting into various

18
0:01:39.080 --> 0:01:45.160
different boxes and trying to find one command that I ran a few days previously on whichever

19
0:01:45.160 --> 0:01:50.680
computer it was was pretty difficult. So I wanted it all in the same place. The first

20
0:01:50.680 --> 0:01:57.000
thing I did was replace the normal ZSH history, bash history or whatever fish uses, I don't

21
0:01:57.000 --> 0:02:03.600
really remember, with a SQLite database. We could then have some functions to import your

22
0:02:03.600 --> 0:02:09.440
normal text history into the database. Because databases are a little bit more flexible than

23
0:02:09.440 --> 0:02:15.080
flat text files, we could also include some additional context. In the case of attun,

24
0:02:15.080 --> 0:02:21.320
this is context such as how long a command took to run, whether or not it was successful,

25
0:02:21.320 --> 0:02:27.360
which directory it was ran in, as well as the shell session. So the way we do this is

26
0:02:27.360 --> 0:02:33.960
we plug into your shell. If your shell supports it, it's via the normal shell hooks, pre-command

27
0:02:33.960 --> 0:02:39.120
or pre-exact and post-command, I think they're called. But in the case of bash, which I do

28
0:02:39.120 --> 0:02:48.360
not have positive feelings towards, we do a really horrible pack with the prompt. So,

29
0:02:48.360 --> 0:02:53.880
hopefully you can see the GIF on the right. On top of this database, we also built a search

30
0:02:53.880 --> 0:03:00.960
TUI. This is bound by default to control R and the up arrow, which is a little bit contentious

31
0:03:00.960 --> 0:03:08.320
for some people, so you can remap that, too. Search UI has three different search modes.

32
0:03:08.320 --> 0:03:14.800
By default, one is a fuzzy search inspired by FZF, the other is a prefix search, which

33
0:03:14.800 --> 0:03:19.720
is pretty self-explanatory and a substring search, which same thing, you should know

34
0:03:19.720 --> 0:03:26.200
what that means. We also have several different filter modes. So, attun allows you to search

35
0:03:26.200 --> 0:03:31.040
your shell history for the current session, for the current directory, for the current

36
0:03:31.040 --> 0:03:36.000
machine or just all of your shell history for every machine ever. That you've connected,

37
0:03:36.000 --> 0:03:41.280
anyway. It would be cool if it could have otherwise. A little bit more on that extra

38
0:03:41.280 --> 0:03:46.360
context. Attun has a stats command which kind of analyzes all of your history and will show

39
0:03:46.360 --> 0:03:50.280
you things like the most used command, which for me is LS. I didn't realise I ran that

40
0:03:50.280 --> 0:03:57.600
so much. How many commands you have ran, as well as how many unique commands you've ran.

41
0:03:57.600 --> 0:04:01.480
We're definitely not making the most of all the data available, and there's a lot more

42
0:04:01.480 --> 0:04:07.000
sort of cool analysis we could do. You can also get the stats for a specific day or week

43
0:04:07.000 --> 0:04:14.000
or month or whatever. A little bit more on the search. You don't have to use the search

44
0:04:14.000 --> 0:04:21.960
UI. We also have a command line search interface. This is kind of useful if you have a specific

45
0:04:21.960 --> 0:04:27.080
command in mind. Maybe you know roughly when it was or roughly what it looks like. It's

46
0:04:27.080 --> 0:04:31.800
also useful to integrate with other tools. Someone on the Discord told me that apparently

47
0:04:31.800 --> 0:04:38.560
they've used this to integrate directly with FZF instead, which is pretty cool. You can

48
0:04:38.560 --> 0:04:44.600
see here that I'm searching for all successfully ran commands after yesterday at 3pm that start

49
0:04:44.600 --> 0:04:51.960
with Git. Obviously, I did not make these slides today. The time specifier supports

50
0:04:51.960 --> 0:05:00.280
like a human way of expressing time, and the command search supports regular expressions.

51
0:05:00.280 --> 0:05:07.000
A little bit more about the Syncs ever. It's a kind of pretty boring HTTP API that shares

52
0:05:07.000 --> 0:05:14.040
blobs. It has no idea what the blobs actually contain. It was originally written with warp,

53
0:05:14.040 --> 0:05:21.400
which I found to be very fun. Kind of nice mental exercise, I guess. We ended up rewriting

54
0:05:21.400 --> 0:05:27.280
with Axum because while warp was fun, it was difficult for contributors to figure out how

55
0:05:27.280 --> 0:05:34.160
to use, and it also contributed pretty massively to a high compile time. And Axum has just

56
0:05:34.160 --> 0:05:40.560
served the problem. The server is completely self-hostable. Anyone with it installed can

57
0:05:40.560 --> 0:05:45.600
just run a 2N server and have a running server. We also have docker images and Kubernetes

58
0:05:45.600 --> 0:05:51.520
manifests for anyone that wants to get a little bit more fancy. A little bit more on the Sync

59
0:05:51.520 --> 0:05:56.220
is that it's not quite realtime yet. While I would love it if it was, it currently syncs

60
0:05:56.220 --> 0:06:02.160
an interval of 15 minutes, and you can reduce this down to zero, which basically means it

61
0:06:02.160 --> 0:06:09.260
will sync after every single command. If you know fancy running your own infrastructure,

62
0:06:09.260 --> 0:06:14.200
there's a public deployment of a 2N that I ran. Currently, it's got about 11 million

63
0:06:14.200 --> 0:06:19.720
lines of shell history on it. There's about 300 active users. It's all running on one

64
0:06:19.720 --> 0:06:24.920
dedicated Hetzena box, and it handles way more requests than I thought it ever would.

65
0:06:24.920 --> 0:06:29.760
I'd also like to thank the GitHub sponsors I got, which I didn't really expect anyone

66
0:06:29.760 --> 0:06:36.960
to contribute, but they cover the server bills entirely now, which is a really nice feeling.

67
0:06:36.960 --> 0:06:40.880
A little bit more about privacy. I imagine people here probably feel more strongly about

68
0:06:40.880 --> 0:06:46.880
that than others. Everything is fully end-to-end encrypted in the Sync, because I really don't

69
0:06:46.880 --> 0:06:54.200
want the responsibility of people accidentally pasted into a shell API keys on my machine.

70
0:06:54.200 --> 0:06:59.560
We use libsodium secret box, because I'm not at all a cryptographer, and it's more difficult

71
0:06:59.560 --> 0:07:05.640
to mess up than most other things. Finding a reliably maintained library for that was

72
0:07:05.640 --> 0:07:13.000
a bit tricky. The original bindings we used were not maintained beyond security patches.

73
0:07:13.000 --> 0:07:17.720
We recently switched to Rust crypto, if I remember rightly. All of the encryption keys

74
0:07:17.720 --> 0:07:22.160
get automatically generated when you log in, and you have to keep track of them yourself.

75
0:07:22.160 --> 0:07:27.160
If you lose your keys, there's nothing I can do. Your data is gone.

76
0:07:27.160 --> 0:07:33.560
So why Rust? This is the Rust dev room, after all. A token runs twice for every shell command

77
0:07:33.560 --> 0:07:38.800
you run. It runs just before and just afterwards. It lets us get the timing data and everything

78
0:07:38.800 --> 0:07:45.320
else. If we had latency there for an interpreter to start up or a run time to do whatever it

79
0:07:45.320 --> 0:07:51.400
does, the experience would not be great. If you added 50 to 100 milliseconds to every

80
0:07:51.400 --> 0:07:58.120
command you ran, people would rightfully complain. So Rust fits the bill very nicely there. It

81
0:07:58.120 --> 0:08:04.800
also has to be reliable, because if we're dropping shell history randomly, then it's

82
0:08:04.800 --> 0:08:10.480
not at all serving the purpose it was written for. Having a static binary to deploy is also

83
0:08:10.480 --> 0:08:16.320
really nice. No one has to make sure they have Rust 3.7, not pointing any languages in

84
0:08:16.320 --> 0:08:21.280
particular, installed on their system with the right versions of various libraries installed

85
0:08:21.280 --> 0:08:25.400
or anything like that. And it's also safe. So, you know, I don't have to worry about

86
0:08:25.400 --> 0:08:31.220
any memory issues or anything like that. The other factor which I think for a side project

87
0:08:31.220 --> 0:08:38.160
is especially important is that Rust is fun. When I started this project, I was also considering

88
0:08:38.160 --> 0:08:44.000
using Go, and I was also writing Go for my day job. I didn't really fancy the idea of

89
0:08:44.000 --> 0:08:49.920
getting home after work, writing Go all day, and then writing some more Go. So Rust solved

90
0:08:49.920 --> 0:08:53.880
that very nicely, and I think the main reason I actually got around to finishing this is

91
0:08:53.880 --> 0:08:59.100
because I was enjoying writing it. Additionally, the Rust community is fantastic. Every time

92
0:08:59.100 --> 0:09:03.560
I've asked for help, people have been really helpful. Everything I wanted has been available,

93
0:09:03.560 --> 0:09:06.960
and they're just generally very welcoming and accepting, especially compared to some

94
0:09:06.960 --> 0:09:13.360
other tech communities. So I actually have one other service, and I'm glad most of the

95
0:09:13.360 --> 0:09:17.800
previous talks have discussed Python, because now I don't feel as weird for mentioning it

96
0:09:17.800 --> 0:09:23.360
in my presentation too. I have another service called rinse wind, a bit of a naming pattern

97
0:09:23.360 --> 0:09:28.680
there, if anyone is familiar with it. What this basically does is it picks into the database

98
0:09:28.680 --> 0:09:33.800
and generates graphs like this, which are heavily inspired by the GitHub commit activity

99
0:09:33.800 --> 0:09:40.320
chart but for your shell history. It's currently closed source for no real reason other than

100
0:09:40.320 --> 0:09:46.320
it's a really horrible hack that I don't want to package nicely for anyone. It mostly uses

101
0:09:46.320 --> 0:09:52.360
NumPy and OpenCV and a few other things. It's also completely opt-in, so you don't get this

102
0:09:52.360 --> 0:09:56.280
by default. If you don't want any proprietary code touching your data, you don't have to.

103
0:09:56.280 --> 0:10:04.280
It's cool. Just with one command, you enable this. On the open source side of things, this

104
0:10:04.280 --> 0:10:08.360
is the first open source project I've released that people have actually been interested

105
0:10:08.360 --> 0:10:14.000
in. I made it just for myself and stuck it on my GitHub, and it ended up being quite

106
0:10:14.000 --> 0:10:19.360
well received by a whole bunch of people. We ended up in a lot of package repositories.

107
0:10:19.360 --> 0:10:25.360
I think off the top of my head, it's the Arch Linux community repo, Homebrew, Alpine Linux,

108
0:10:25.360 --> 0:10:30.240
and some Nix. I'm not entirely sure how Nix works, but one of the Nix repositories. There's

109
0:10:30.240 --> 0:10:36.960
probably a whole bunch more that I'm not aware of. We've actually got 63 contributors as

110
0:10:36.960 --> 0:10:42.760
of today. Some of them are returning regular contributors, which is very nice that people

111
0:10:42.760 --> 0:10:47.480
want to regularly give time to my project. Some of them are just sort of drive-by. They

112
0:10:47.480 --> 0:10:51.320
found something that annoyed them or a bug they wanted to fix or something like that.

113
0:10:51.320 --> 0:10:56.240
They contributed, which was lovely. I'd also like to especially thank Conrad. He's much

114
0:10:56.240 --> 0:11:01.000
more involved in the Rust community than I am and also a very long-term friend of mine.

115
0:11:01.000 --> 0:11:05.520
He helps me maintain a 2in, and when I was first starting and not so good at Rust, he

116
0:11:05.520 --> 0:11:13.800
did a great job of tidying things up a bit. In terms of the future, right now, a 2in has

117
0:11:13.800 --> 0:11:19.000
a bit of a flaw in that you can't actually delete history once it's been synced. This

118
0:11:19.000 --> 0:11:23.560
is mostly because the sync is pretty consistent, and every machine you have is a potential

119
0:11:23.560 --> 0:11:28.440
writer, so ensuring that you delete something and it stays deleted is actually really difficult.

120
0:11:28.440 --> 0:11:33.560
I've currently got a solution to it which works on my laptop. I just need to make sure

121
0:11:33.560 --> 0:11:40.040
it works on everyone else's too. I'd also like to sort out Bash, because pretty much

122
0:11:40.040 --> 0:11:45.720
all the complaints we get about shell integrations are from people running Bash, and it's very

123
0:11:45.720 --> 0:11:49.720
frustrating. I don't actually use Bash, and I hate having a setup on my machine just for

124
0:11:49.720 --> 0:11:56.880
that. I'd also like to show some more information in the TUI. I don't know if you saw very much

125
0:11:56.880 --> 0:12:01.280
on the GIF earlier, but it basically just shows what's useful for search results. I

126
0:12:01.280 --> 0:12:05.400
would love it if there was another tab where you could also see sort of statistics about

127
0:12:05.400 --> 0:12:10.400
a command that's run, maybe how often it succeeds versus fails. You could get some nice stats

128
0:12:10.400 --> 0:12:15.760
about make-build that way, and that sort of thing. I'd like to improve the search a little

129
0:12:15.760 --> 0:12:21.840
bit too, because right now it's good enough, and I think it could always be improved. I've

130
0:12:21.840 --> 0:12:26.800
been meaning to explore some of the full-text search modules that SQLite has, or maybe something

131
0:12:26.800 --> 0:12:33.280
like TanTV or one of the other search libraries in Rust. Otherwise, I'd really like to improve

132
0:12:33.280 --> 0:12:39.800
the sorting. Right now, we sort chronologically, which is a pretty safe default. I'm not going

133
0:12:39.800 --> 0:12:44.080
to turn this into a horrible Twitter timeline type thing, but it would be nice if we could

134
0:12:44.080 --> 0:12:49.320
sort based on the context we have. Maybe every day at 9am, you CD into your repo and you

135
0:12:49.320 --> 0:12:54.240
run Git pull. By default, it would be nice if you press Ctrl-R and Git pull was already

136
0:12:54.240 --> 0:12:58.040
there at the time that you frequently run it. We've got all the data for that. It just

137
0:12:58.040 --> 0:13:05.920
needs to be plugged together. In the even further future, the number of people that have spoken

138
0:13:05.920 --> 0:13:11.160
to me about the fact that they have development API keys in their shell history, it would

139
0:13:11.160 --> 0:13:15.080
be nice if we could do something to get that out of the shell history and sync that alongside

140
0:13:15.080 --> 0:13:21.880
the data. Being able to bookmark commands is also something I would quite like to be

141
0:13:21.880 --> 0:13:27.440
able to do, because there's some longer commands I run frequently and search for frequently,

142
0:13:27.440 --> 0:13:33.440
having some sort of hotkey or alias would be really nice. Otherwise, I realised that

143
0:13:33.440 --> 0:13:38.560
a subset of a to-ends history could also be used as a runbook if you had a begin and an

144
0:13:38.560 --> 0:13:45.760
end marker to it and you could just replay some commands from your past. That's actually

145
0:13:45.760 --> 0:13:50.400
it. I went a bit faster than I was expecting, but if there are any questions, I'd be very

146
0:13:50.400 --> 0:14:06.560
happy to answer them.

147
0:14:06.560 --> 0:14:12.520
Can you search for things which have come after your most recent command frequently?

148
0:14:12.520 --> 0:14:16.960
I'm not sure what you mean, sorry. To take what you've just typed and see what you typically

149
0:14:16.960 --> 0:14:21.880
do next. So actually returning the command after the one you've searched for.

150
0:14:21.880 --> 0:14:26.160
That's one of the things I'd love to be able to do with the smarter ordering is know a

151
0:14:26.160 --> 0:14:30.560
sequence of commands that's commonly run and predict the next one based on history. If

152
0:14:30.560 --> 0:14:32.760
that's...

153
0:14:32.760 --> 0:14:46.560
So, I tried to install your tool, but I'm using Bash and I was wondering how far are

154
0:14:46.560 --> 0:14:48.720
you with fixing Bash?

155
0:14:48.720 --> 0:14:52.800
Bash generally works fine. It's usually the people that have a whole bunch of Bash plugins

156
0:14:52.800 --> 0:14:59.280
installed or have a weird Bash prompt that start to have some issues, but generally it's

157
0:14:59.280 --> 0:15:06.280
okay for most people.

158
0:15:06.280 --> 0:15:19.120
Does it handle having different cells in different computers? For example, if I'm using one computer

159
0:15:19.120 --> 0:15:24.560
Fizz and another CSA, does the thing work between those two?

160
0:15:24.560 --> 0:15:31.120
Yes. So we translate from whatever your shell uses natively into the format we use. So whichever

161
0:15:31.120 --> 0:15:33.200
shell you use on each machine doesn't matter.

162
0:15:33.200 --> 0:15:34.200
Okay. Thanks.

163
0:15:34.200 --> 0:15:43.280
I have a couple of questions. First, I didn't quite get how do you authenticate with the

164
0:15:43.280 --> 0:15:47.120
server by having a key?

165
0:15:47.120 --> 0:15:51.840
So the sort of user authentication is just a username and password, but then your actual

166
0:15:51.840 --> 0:15:55.280
data is encrypted by a key that's only held locally.

167
0:15:55.280 --> 0:16:01.720
All right. And second question, do you have a home AZSH plugin or have you considered

168
0:16:01.720 --> 0:16:02.720
one?

169
0:16:02.720 --> 0:16:07.440
So we have a ZSH plugin. You can use normal ZSH plugin managers to install and use it.

170
0:16:07.440 --> 0:16:19.720
All right. Thank you.

171
0:16:19.720 --> 0:16:24.040
Getting some exercise in.

172
0:16:24.040 --> 0:16:31.120
Is it possible to disable the history for a few commands and then re-enable it?

173
0:16:31.120 --> 0:16:36.040
Not currently. We have spoken about the idea of an incognito mode. If you prefix a command

174
0:16:36.040 --> 0:16:39.400
with a space, it won't be saved. It's kind of annoying if you have to run a lot of them

175
0:16:39.400 --> 0:16:41.680
in a way.

176
0:16:41.680 --> 0:16:50.480
We have some questions from the matrix. So Olivier says how would it interact with something

177
0:16:50.480 --> 0:16:51.960
like Starship?

178
0:16:51.960 --> 0:16:57.400
I actually use Starship and it doesn't interact with it at all in that it works completely

179
0:16:57.400 --> 0:16:58.400
fine.

180
0:16:58.400 --> 0:17:04.200
Awesome. And, yeah, that was the only question.

181
0:17:04.200 --> 0:17:06.760
Cool. Thank you.

182
0:17:06.760 --> 0:17:13.360
There's one at the front too.

183
0:17:13.360 --> 0:17:18.720
Two short questions. The first one is, since Besh is so probably, I'm using Besh. What's

184
0:17:18.720 --> 0:17:20.120
your favorite, Cheryl?

185
0:17:20.120 --> 0:17:25.280
I like ZSH, I think purely because I started using it maybe 10 years ago and have it so

186
0:17:25.280 --> 0:17:31.640
hard to break. I think if I was going to start again, I'd probably try fish a bit more.

187
0:17:31.640 --> 0:17:35.800
And a question about the time stamps. Are you using the client-side time stamps from the

188
0:17:35.800 --> 0:17:37.320
machines or server-side?

189
0:17:37.320 --> 0:17:42.560
We store client-side, the time stamp will be whatever your client is, but we use two

190
0:17:42.560 --> 0:17:48.200
time stamps to sync to work. We have the server local time stamp, which is only used for syncing,

191
0:17:48.200 --> 0:17:53.280
and the actual data is all encrypted and hidden, so it's whatever your client stores.

192
0:17:53.280 --> 0:17:58.320
Sometimes the local time stamp is important if you want to sync with the system, but sometimes

193
0:17:58.320 --> 0:18:00.320
also the whole time.

194
0:18:00.320 --> 0:18:05.920
The computers are out of sync. I had a bunch of issues of time stamps when I was first

195
0:18:05.920 --> 0:18:11.800
writing it, but we got it all sorted out in the end.

196
0:18:11.800 --> 0:18:16.200
Is there a limit to the length of command? For example, imagine a huge pipeline with

197
0:18:16.200 --> 0:18:19.840
the SQLs and JQ queries in there.

198
0:18:19.840 --> 0:18:25.160
Currently it's eight megabytes of whatever it is once it's been encrypted. It's only

199
0:18:25.160 --> 0:18:28.200
a server-side limit, and it's pretty arbitrary.

200
0:18:28.200 --> 0:18:35.960
Another question. Any plans for special handling for similar commands? Maybe fix syntax if

201
0:18:35.960 --> 0:18:39.960
you run similar commands in a row?

202
0:18:39.960 --> 0:18:43.640
I hadn't really thought of that before, but it might be worth considering.

203
0:18:43.640 --> 0:18:51.280
Sorry, I did have a few more questions from Matrix. I think my device is not synchronizing

204
0:18:51.280 --> 0:18:54.840
properly, but Andy sent me a screenshot.

205
0:18:54.840 --> 0:18:59.560
Does it integrate with regular history mechanisms provided by the shell, for example, excluding

206
0:18:59.560 --> 0:19:06.200
certain commands automatically like CDNLS, skipping storing in history by prefixing with

207
0:19:06.200 --> 0:19:09.080
white space for sensitive commands, etc.?

208
0:19:09.080 --> 0:19:14.880
The prefixing with white space is included. The default ignoring is not, but it doesn't

209
0:19:14.880 --> 0:19:19.480
actually replace the text file history either. You will still write to that if you ever decide

210
0:19:19.480 --> 0:19:22.080
you want to stop using it.

211
0:19:22.080 --> 0:19:25.960
Where would context-aware recommendations come from?

212
0:19:25.960 --> 0:19:31.000
If we have a history of your shell, we know the directories you're in, we know what commands

213
0:19:31.000 --> 0:19:34.680
you've been running at what times, so if we're predicting the next command that you want

214
0:19:34.680 --> 0:19:37.840
to run, we can use your own history.

215
0:19:37.840 --> 0:19:40.120
The question follows up with, it's end-to-end encrypted.

216
0:19:40.120 --> 0:19:45.200
It would all be from the client. The server's just a dumb blob store. It doesn't really

217
0:19:45.200 --> 0:19:47.200
know much of anything.

218
0:19:47.200 --> 0:19:54.200
Any more questions? I think that's it.

219
0:19:54.200 --> 0:19:56.200
Awesome. Thank you.

220
0:19:56.200 --> 0:19:58.200
Thank you.

221
0:19:58.200 --> 0:20:17.200
That was really well.
