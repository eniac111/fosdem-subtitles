1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
André is going to talk about Neovim.

2
0:00:07.000 --> 0:00:11.000
I went through this deck, it's actually really cool.

3
0:00:11.000 --> 0:00:14.000
Before you go on, I need to give you this.

4
0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:15.000
Yeah.

5
0:00:15.000 --> 0:00:21.000
No, we need this one for the projection.

6
0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:27.000
So, here you go.

7
0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:33.000
One, one, one. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

8
0:00:33.000 --> 0:00:34.000
Yes.

9
0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:41.000
Cool. I can use it.

10
0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:44.000
Let's start so we don't have time.

11
0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:50.000
Okay. Today I will talk about Rust and Neovim.

12
0:00:50.000 --> 0:00:54.000
So, if you see something inaccurate, I'm new in Rust,

13
0:00:54.000 --> 0:00:58.000
please not judge me too much. A little bit about me.

14
0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:03.000
I'm André, I'm from Ukraine, now living in Vienna, in Austria.

15
0:01:03.000 --> 0:01:09.000
I do a lot Go, Python. I love gymnastics, on other stuff.

16
0:01:09.000 --> 0:01:15.000
I love speaking. I just dig talk in another room, so I just move forward.

17
0:01:15.000 --> 0:01:16.000
Cool. Let's start.

18
0:01:16.000 --> 0:01:27.000
So, Neovim is the most loved editor in 2021 and in 2022.

19
0:01:27.000 --> 0:01:31.000
And Rust is the most loved language in 2022.

20
0:01:31.000 --> 0:01:36.000
So, I feel it's a win-win. It's the best combination you can ever see.

21
0:01:36.000 --> 0:01:41.000
So, can you raise a hand very quick who uses like Neovim or something?

22
0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:44.000
Oh, it's my audience. Nice, nice.

23
0:01:44.000 --> 0:01:52.000
So, next slide is for you. If you, like me, love to spend all the day, weekends,

24
0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:57.000
configuring my development environment, please don't tell it to my boss.

25
0:01:57.000 --> 0:02:04.000
And since all of you using Neovim, I think you know how to quit from Wim, right?

26
0:02:04.000 --> 0:02:09.000
No need to explain. Cool. So, sugar, smoking also. Cool.

27
0:02:09.000 --> 0:02:18.000
So, first things first, Neovim is just a fork of Wim, which is focused on like extensibility and usability.

28
0:02:18.000 --> 0:02:25.000
One of the examples is they injected or added ability to write plugins in Lua, which is great.

29
0:02:25.000 --> 0:02:35.000
And since 0.5, as you know, Neovim supports LSP client framework.

30
0:02:35.000 --> 0:02:39.000
All good? All good.

31
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:46.000
This means Neovim can work as a client to LSP servers like Rust Analyzer and building other tools.

32
0:02:46.000 --> 0:02:55.000
So, to prove my words, yeah, if you open Neovim and type help LSP, it's like inside editor, which is nice.

33
0:02:55.000 --> 0:02:58.000
And you can read what you can do.

34
0:02:58.000 --> 0:03:03.000
So, and for some of you who don't know what is LSP, very quick.

35
0:03:03.000 --> 0:03:07.000
So, LSP is like a, I don't know, a bridge.

36
0:03:07.000 --> 0:03:14.000
So, now you can focus on developers of language servers, can focus on developing language servers.

37
0:03:14.000 --> 0:03:18.000
And developers of editors can focus on editors.

38
0:03:18.000 --> 0:03:21.000
And it's like win-win again.

39
0:03:21.000 --> 0:03:24.000
Because previously, it was like this.

40
0:03:24.000 --> 0:03:29.000
You need to write a tool which format your code or whatever.

41
0:03:29.000 --> 0:03:33.000
It parse all three and depend on language.

42
0:03:33.000 --> 0:03:35.000
You can integrate it.

43
0:03:35.000 --> 0:03:38.000
And jumping between languages is hard.

44
0:03:38.000 --> 0:03:41.000
That's why it's nice when you have this LSP.

45
0:03:41.000 --> 0:03:44.000
So, quick start.

46
0:03:44.000 --> 0:03:46.000
I assume you know how to install Neovim.

47
0:03:46.000 --> 0:03:58.000
So, if you never did it before, I highly recommend to start with this one file config, which is here, and put it in your config location.

48
0:03:58.000 --> 0:04:02.000
What it does, it's very small.

49
0:04:02.000 --> 0:04:07.000
And it has few important plugins, which helps you to try it out.

50
0:04:07.000 --> 0:04:21.000
And I highly recommend to use it because it's easy to start doing something small and simple, rather than starting like, okay, I need like lots of files, I need to reap off all my configs, etc.

51
0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:26.000
And as soon as you know more, you can refactor it.

52
0:04:26.000 --> 0:04:39.000
So, and this file includes this new mason plugin, which helps you to install language servers, which is handy, because you can do it directly from Neovim.

53
0:04:39.000 --> 0:04:46.000
And it will install binaries directly to Neovim standard pass.

54
0:04:46.000 --> 0:05:00.000
And when you start Neovim, it will add this like location, so Neovim and tooling will can communicate with these binaries and it supports LSP.

55
0:05:00.000 --> 0:05:05.000
So also for debuggers for linters for matters.

56
0:05:05.000 --> 0:05:08.000
Sorry.

57
0:05:08.000 --> 0:05:16.000
Next. So, when you're done, you can you can see this after complete, which is great.

58
0:05:16.000 --> 0:05:19.000
Another interesting feature you can do after imports.

59
0:05:19.000 --> 0:05:26.000
So, for example, if you use hash map, but you forget to import it, I usually do it, it's very nice.

60
0:05:26.000 --> 0:05:42.000
And if you bind this code action, it will print you like different depend on on which part of code you are. If it has any connections, for example, import hash map.

61
0:05:42.000 --> 0:05:48.000
You can type and import it automatically. And that's it. It's very cool.

62
0:05:48.000 --> 0:05:55.000
Same with rename. So now, all haters of VIM can say that you're renaming using grep.

63
0:05:55.000 --> 0:06:02.000
So you can rename using syntax3, be smart and using entire code base.

64
0:06:02.000 --> 0:06:11.000
And that's it. Yeah, I supposed to make a juice, but since we decided to reduce talk, I just have a pictures.

65
0:06:11.000 --> 0:06:23.000
If you like me for getting your key maps, because you have tons, you can just use this nice plug-in telescope key maps and just remind yourself, oh, shit, it just finds you find this.

66
0:06:23.000 --> 0:06:39.000
So very handy. For example, I forget the LSP references so I can find how to run how to run it. And again, this LSP references is more or less language agnostic.

67
0:06:39.000 --> 0:06:52.000
It's extension of telescope, which like get it and show you. You can do our documentation. You can do, I don't know, signature help and many more other features,

68
0:06:52.000 --> 0:07:00.000
which I unfortunately can't cover in this short talk, but I highly recommend you go to this page and see how smart trust analyzer.

69
0:07:00.000 --> 0:07:14.000
It can do very nice refactoring, like I don't know, apply Moore's law for your binary logic, replace some patterns, etc.

70
0:07:14.000 --> 0:07:22.000
So I'm personally using big config. You can, if you want, you can check it. It's more organized because it's really big.

71
0:07:22.000 --> 0:07:36.000
It's not one file. And if you need refresh knowledge about WIM, there are two really good books I ever read about editors and you can play a little bit with WIM Golf.

72
0:07:36.000 --> 0:07:49.000
If you never try, I highly recommend. Yeah, and a few references of guys which inspire me to use new WIM a lot. And thank you.

73
0:07:49.000 --> 0:08:07.000
Questions.
