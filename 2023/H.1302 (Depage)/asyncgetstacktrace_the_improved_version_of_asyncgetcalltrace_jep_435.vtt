00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Yes, hi, I'm Johannes Bechberger.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.840
I was already introduced.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.440
I work at the sub-machine.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.320
It's another great distribution of the OpenJDK.

00:15.320 --> 00:22.520
So I worked since the beginning of last year on my new project on Async get set trace.

00:22.520 --> 00:27.440
It's essentially an improved version of the Async get call trace API.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.400
And I think many of you probably don't know this API.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.720
I didn't know it before I started this project.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.720
But essentially, it's related to profiling.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.080
So how does profiling work?

00:40.080 --> 00:43.160
Some of you might have always seen FlameCrafts.

00:43.160 --> 00:51.840
If not, there are some other talks on profiling in the Mozilla room that you can look it up.

00:51.840 --> 00:56.440
But essentially, what profiling is, you want to see which parts of your applications are

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
possible.

00:57.440 --> 01:03.480
For example, here, I can see that some JDK stuff is probably a thing that takes time.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.440
But essentially, how it works under the hood is that we have a selection of threads, like

01:07.440 --> 01:09.520
for example here, five threads.

01:09.520 --> 01:17.200
Then we randomly select three threads because we cannot usually sample all threads because

01:17.200 --> 01:19.200
it would be too costly.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.120
Then we pre-allocate some traces.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.920
This is just a data structure where we store the stack frame information in.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.280
And then we ping the first thread.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.520
And with ping, I mean we send it a signal.

01:30.520 --> 01:35.400
And then in the signal handle, we walk the stack because in the single handler, the thread

01:35.400 --> 01:37.200
is stopped.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.400
So it can walk the stack.

01:38.400 --> 01:45.400
We do this with the thread two, with the thread five, and we have the traces.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
And then we store it.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.600
And then we do some post-processing.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.400
That's essentially how Async profile works, but just in a loop.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.480
In a loop, we always do this.

01:56.480 --> 02:02.320
And so we need an API because we need an API.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.520
It's called Async at call trace because we could use JVMTR libraries.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.800
They are safe from bias.

02:07.800 --> 02:13.920
So they let the threads wait till they're ready, till they're at a safe point, but we

02:13.920 --> 02:19.520
want to have the call trace at a certain point where we want it.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.080
And so Async at call trace is quite a cool API.

02:22.080 --> 02:26.440
So how it works, here we have the stack, how it's on your system.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.000
We have at the bottom the pthread start.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.240
It's on the Unix system.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.000
And on top, we have some Java frames.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.400
And then it goes up to the top to write byte method because it writes to a buffered output

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
stream.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.960
It's essentially print, hello world, it just prints some strings.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.400
And in the single handler, we get the top frame.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.240
That's where the u context from the single handler points to.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.760
Then we do some stack blocking and Async at call trace does it for us.

02:59.760 --> 03:08.200
And essentially, it returns us in a pre-allocated data structure, the frames, and the number

03:08.200 --> 03:09.720
of frames that we got.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.400
And it also stores a number of frames in error code if there was an error.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.240
And so what we get for every frame is the line number.

03:17.240 --> 03:21.360
So it's called line number, but it's essentially the bytecode index.

03:21.360 --> 03:29.320
I don't know, it's historically this way because this API is from 2003 around and we get a

03:29.320 --> 03:31.200
method ID.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.920
But we only get this information on Java frames.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.440
So what are these problems?

03:36.440 --> 03:38.080
So don't get me started.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.560
I worked on it for long enough time.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.320
So it's unofficial.

03:44.320 --> 03:51.160
So it's there in 2003, like for three months, and then Oracle put it out, Sun at the time

03:51.160 --> 03:53.000
put it away.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.880
It's now just lying around as an exported symbol but doesn't have its own header.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.480
It's unsupported.

04:00.480 --> 04:07.420
So if there's a change in another part of the JVM that potentially breaks it, nobody

04:07.420 --> 04:13.880
notices it because there's only one single test that doesn't test that much.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.880
So there's also missing information.

04:15.880 --> 04:25.320
So it only gives us information on the stack frames of the Java frames but not on anything

04:25.320 --> 04:26.320
else.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.040
And it misses information like inlining, which isn't that great.

04:30.040 --> 04:39.160
And so in the beginning of last year, I started to work on a new API because this, I think,

04:39.160 --> 04:40.600
a call trace is the best we have.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.080
And maybe we could do something better.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.800
So I started to work on Async at Stack Trades.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
It's now a CHAP candidate.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.040
It's 435.

04:52.040 --> 04:59.120
So if you want to see the CHAP in its entirety, just go on the Opti SDK website or read the

04:59.120 --> 05:05.040
blog post for this talk and you get a picture of what it does.

05:05.040 --> 05:11.520
And so the idea was to create a better API that gives us more information and is far

05:11.520 --> 05:15.120
more supported, so with lots of tests with its own header.

05:15.120 --> 05:23.640
And so again, we have the stack, our stack, but we then get more information.

05:23.640 --> 05:29.880
For example, we get at its most basic level, we also get the kind of the thread that we're

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
running on.

05:30.880 --> 05:38.800
So is this thread like in Java mode or is this in GC mode or what is this thread, which

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
is quite neat.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.960
And we got more information.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.640
For example, we get the BCI.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.120
It's no-call BCI because, yeah, it's the byte code index.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.560
We get a method ID.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.120
We get also the type.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
Is it inline?

05:50.120 --> 05:52.200
Is it native?

05:52.200 --> 06:00.680
With native, I mean not C, C++, but these boundary methods that are defined in Java,

06:00.680 --> 06:05.160
but like which code is implemented in C, C++.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.640
And we also get the compilation level.

06:06.640 --> 06:11.640
So is it C1, C2 compiled or don't compile at all?

06:11.640 --> 06:14.560
So this is quite neat because we get more information.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.760
But the cool thing is we have options now.

06:17.760 --> 06:25.880
We can, with this API, we can set in an integer, hey, we want to have non-Java frames and

06:25.880 --> 06:33.800
we also want to walk non-Java threads, which leads us to this situation where we get information

06:33.800 --> 06:40.720
also on the thread on these C, C++ frames, which is quite nice because for these frames

06:40.720 --> 06:42.240
we get also the type.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.200
So it's a C, C++ and we also get a program counter.

06:46.200 --> 06:55.160
So we can then go back, do some of our own analysis and use DLSim to get the methods

06:55.160 --> 06:59.360
of the DL family and get the method name.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.080
And we can also walk with these options non-Java threads.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.480
So we see more information.

07:04.480 --> 07:10.360
It essentially makes the life of a profile developer far easier because we can now just

07:10.360 --> 07:12.080
use this API.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.600
It will be supported.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.520
If it gets in, it will be supported.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.680
I'm working on lots and lots of tests.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.640
And yeah, that's, I hope it gets in.

07:22.640 --> 07:30.440
And as a bonus, what I also introduced is new methods for OpenJDK developers to walk

07:30.440 --> 07:35.000
stacks because currently the code is spread between a few different places.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.520
Some of them are copies of others.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.280
So it's quite hard when you change some port.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.680
You have to change other parts too.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.840
So it's essentially technical depth.

07:45.840 --> 07:54.560
There were good reasons in the years before, but still I want to make stack walking easier.

07:54.560 --> 08:04.000
So the new API that I used in the implementation of my chat proposal allows us to just give

08:04.000 --> 08:06.880
a stack walker some options like, hey, I want to walk stacks.

08:06.880 --> 08:11.280
I want to skip, I want to walk also non-Java frames.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.240
And I can just go over and say, oh, give me the next frame.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.960
And on this next frame, we can ask all the information.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
Is this a Java frame?

08:19.960 --> 08:21.200
Is this a native frame?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.840
Which is this compilation level?

08:22.840 --> 08:28.160
And this makes it far easier to walk stacks.

08:28.160 --> 08:34.440
And hopefully makes it easier to combine all the stack walking from some ever-related stack

08:34.440 --> 08:40.800
traces from async get call trace from JFR using one API.

08:40.800 --> 08:46.840
And so when you make an improvement in one of these APIs and implementations, you get

08:46.840 --> 08:49.440
an improvement on all.

08:49.440 --> 08:55.600
So what I've done is that I improved async get call trace with the help of my colleagues

08:55.600 --> 09:07.200
to be much safer, so I wrote testing code that used safe set so that it kind of checks

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
the pointer before it exists.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.000
So it's far safer than I did here for async get stack trace.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.320
Lots of testing, for example, I did some fuzzing.

09:16.320 --> 09:23.160
So I called async get stack trace with random u-context, so with randomized frame pointers

09:23.160 --> 09:29.160
and stack pointers, and it doesn't crash like for hours on a large machine, which is quite

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
cool.

09:30.160 --> 09:37.760
And so this covers async get async profile when it modifies the frame and stack pointer

09:37.760 --> 09:46.120
to alleviate some concerns when the VM is in undefined state.

09:46.120 --> 09:51.760
It needs a lot of convincing, so I'm still in the process where I have to talk with all

09:51.760 --> 09:54.640
the people from Oracle, all the JFR people.

09:54.640 --> 10:01.840
It's a long, drawn-out process, but I hope I can convince them, because clearly the people

10:01.840 --> 10:09.880
on the profiler side are really happy to have this because it has many advantages for them.

10:09.880 --> 10:15.280
And of course, again, testing, because the whole point of this API is that you get more

10:15.280 --> 10:18.480
information but also that it's a better tested API.

10:18.480 --> 10:23.680
Currently, I have six tests, and I'm working on more.

10:23.680 --> 10:28.080
So I hope that it gets in.

10:28.080 --> 10:37.760
Till then, you can see on GitHub there's a draft PR on the strap.

10:37.760 --> 10:44.080
Just search in the PRs for draft PR with R-SkiST in the name.

10:44.080 --> 10:50.520
And then you can follow me on Twitter and our team at SpeedSubmachine, and that's all.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.840
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

10:52.840 --> 11:00.720
And I'm also blogging mostly in others, and all the blog posts are also put on FUJ.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.960
But you can follow me there and read on all the topics that they talked today.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.960
So thanks.

11:05.960 --> 11:14.840
Question, yes.

11:14.840 --> 11:22.520
So SafeHatch, I think it uses signal handlers, so it cannot be called from a signal handler,

11:22.520 --> 11:24.520
so what do you do there?

11:24.520 --> 11:25.520
Wally.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
Oh, yes.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.680
The question was, can SafeHatch be called from signal handlers because it uses signals?

11:31.680 --> 11:36.400
I think it uses different signals because I didn't have any problems using it from signal

11:36.400 --> 11:37.400
handlers.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.840
So I have tests.

11:38.840 --> 11:44.880
To use us and get stack-dressed, you have to use signal handlers, so I didn't see any

11:44.880 --> 11:45.880
problems so far.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.320
I think that's possible.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.040
It's even weird because from signal handlers, you cannot do any mallocs, so you have to

11:51.040 --> 11:53.940
preallocate, but you can call fork.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.320
So it's quite interesting.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.320
Any other questions?

11:57.320 --> 12:02.400
Does it handle invoke dynamics, especially?

12:02.400 --> 12:08.480
Because within that stack, you'll get the whole stacker deciding how to dispatch the

12:08.480 --> 12:12.040
call.

12:12.040 --> 12:16.960
So the question was, does it handle invoke dynamics specifically?

12:16.960 --> 12:23.680
Now it just uses, it just is based on the frame stack-walking and the internal mechanism

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
of stack-walking.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.000
So it doesn't handle it differently than, for example, I think, get call trace and

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
trace R.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That's all Java frames.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.840
Yeah, that's all Java frames, so that's probably fine.

12:35.840 --> 12:41.000
You have to change the negative parts?

12:41.000 --> 12:46.280
Or does it work on all platforms?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.160
So the question was, does it work on all platforms?

12:49.160 --> 12:53.720
It's known that it doesn't really work on Windows just because Windows hasn't really

12:53.720 --> 12:54.920
a concept of signals.

12:54.920 --> 13:01.000
If you have any ideas on getting something like this to work on Windows, feel free to

13:01.000 --> 13:02.840
drop me a message.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.880
So no, I didn't have to change any native parts.

13:05.880 --> 13:13.000
I had to create some native parts for testing to modify the U-context, because this is highly

13:13.000 --> 13:16.680
operating system specific.

13:16.680 --> 13:24.240
So the changes to the whole OpenJDK are fairly minimal, so they aren't that large besides

13:24.240 --> 13:27.840
passing through some bullet to configure stuff.

13:27.840 --> 13:34.240
And the code itself is just a few couple hundred lines, so it's quite simple also to understand,

13:34.240 --> 13:40.640
and there's a blog post that describes the reasoning behind it.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.640
Any other questions?

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
Yes?

13:42.640 --> 13:46.440
Is it already a sub-machine?

13:46.440 --> 13:52.680
No, it's not yet on the sub-machine, because I'm still in the process of testing it.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.720
So there's, of course, a podcast.

13:54.720 --> 14:00.280
You can already use the JVM when you compile it yourself.

14:00.280 --> 14:06.640
I'm in the process to updating my demo repository, which contains a modified sync profile that

14:06.640 --> 14:10.680
uses it, so you can try it out yourself.

14:10.680 --> 14:19.040
I'll try it out in the next few weeks, it still has some bugs.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.040
Anything else?

14:20.040 --> 14:21.040
Thank you very much.

14:21.040 --> 14:46.640
Thank you very much.
