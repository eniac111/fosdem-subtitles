00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
Hey, everyone. My name is Tom, and today I'll be talking to you about starting an open source

00:11.120 --> 00:17.800
startup. So about this talk, it's directed at early stage startups or people thinking

00:17.800 --> 00:22.360
about starting one with an open source product or people thinking about open sourcing the

00:22.360 --> 00:26.420
existing product. If you were here for the previous talk, it was more about the step

00:26.420 --> 00:29.960
one to step two. Here I'm going to talk about zero to one. You don't have a product yet,

00:29.960 --> 00:37.160
you're just starting out. So what is an early stage startup? For the purpose of this talk,

00:37.160 --> 00:42.600
it's an early stage company that's designed to grow fast, open backed by venture capitalists,

00:42.600 --> 00:49.760
so investors, and aiming for very high revenue. You have to remember, and maybe it's important

00:49.760 --> 00:54.400
to frame the rest of the talk around this, is that this is a capitalistic endeavor. You're

00:54.400 --> 00:58.560
taking money from people and you're promising them to return them more money after a certain

00:58.560 --> 01:02.600
amount of time. You have to remember that all throughout things. It's something that's

01:02.600 --> 01:07.440
so easy to forget, but that's the basis for everything else. It's especially easy for

01:07.440 --> 01:11.800
us to forget because we're so used to giving so much free value to the world with our open

01:11.800 --> 01:15.680
source contribution, and also taking a lot of free value back by using Linux, by using

01:15.680 --> 01:20.240
KDE, by using all of these tools. But if you're out there building a business, taking money

01:20.240 --> 01:25.960
from investors, that's something that's important to remember. So who am I? I'm the founder

01:25.960 --> 01:30.920
and CEO of Zwix. It's a company we started as a business and then open sourced a product,

01:30.920 --> 01:35.480
although that was the intention from the beginning, and also created Ettasync that started as

01:35.480 --> 01:40.760
an open source project and then turned into a business. I'm obsessed with API, developer

01:40.760 --> 01:46.480
tools, been around for a while, worked on Enlightenment, OpenMoco, and a few other projects

01:46.480 --> 01:52.280
as well. So what is Zwix? We do webhook sending as a service. It's an API-first developer

01:52.280 --> 01:57.680
tool. We have companies send webhooks essentially. It's both open core, hand and host a product,

01:57.680 --> 02:02.480
as we do both. We raise over $10 million from top investors, including Y Combinator and

02:02.480 --> 02:10.080
Tristan Horowitz, Adaf, and founders and CTOs of companies such as GitHub, Page

02:10.080 --> 02:13.720
Entity Segment, Lookout, and Flite.io. So why am I even giving this talk? So there are

02:13.720 --> 02:17.800
a lot of resources for how to start a startup online, a lot of great resources, but there

02:17.800 --> 02:23.040
aren't a lot of resources for open source startups, especially not ones that come from

02:23.040 --> 02:26.440
the community, from people that actually understand open source. It's more like an opportunistic

02:26.440 --> 02:30.920
approach that a lot of people take. And also a lot of people have been asking me for advice

02:30.920 --> 02:39.000
over the years, even this weekend, as I figured, why not? Let's make a deck out of it. So before

02:39.000 --> 02:44.160
we begin, why even start a startup? I saw a talk by one of the co-founders of Facebook

02:44.160 --> 02:47.920
many years ago, and it really resonated with me, especially now that I've seen other people

02:47.920 --> 02:52.720
start companies, have started companies myself. And a lot of people think it's cool. You know,

02:52.720 --> 02:55.720
your vision is that you're going to hit launch, you just finished building a product, you

02:55.720 --> 02:59.160
got to press attention, you know, go wakeboarding with Obama, I don't know what you want to

02:59.160 --> 03:03.760
do, rock star. But the reality is that no one is actually going to care at all. You're

03:03.760 --> 03:06.760
going to beg them for press attention, you're going to beg customers to use your shitty

03:06.760 --> 03:10.760
product and really, honestly, you don't have time for press and all of the rock star stuff

03:10.760 --> 03:15.400
anyway. You're building a business. And also a lot of people think that they want to be

03:15.400 --> 03:19.480
the boss. You know, big office, private steam room, make a billion dollar deals, private

03:19.480 --> 03:23.600
jets, all of that stuff. In reality, it's a noisy co-working space if you're lucky,

03:23.600 --> 03:27.520
most likely your kitchen counter. And begging people to try a product again and fighting

03:27.520 --> 03:33.040
for survival. So it's really not that, it's not that what you think. Another thing people

03:33.040 --> 03:37.880
think, well, I'm my own boss, I'm going to have flexibility. I love this quote. As an

03:37.880 --> 03:41.800
entrepreneur, you get some flexibility, you get to choose which 24 hours of the day work

03:41.800 --> 03:46.920
on. It's so true. And for a variety of reasons. First of all, your customers are demanding

03:46.920 --> 03:50.060
and you want to make sure that they're served right. You don't want to lose that deal just

03:50.060 --> 03:55.280
because you're unavailable, even though it's your wife's birthday or some other occasion.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.120
And the other reason is you're really obsessed with what you're building. So you're actually

03:58.120 --> 04:01.400
thinking about it all the time anyway. And you have ideas in the shower and you have

04:01.400 --> 04:05.400
ideas during dinner and you're just dying to go back and kind of like put that into

04:05.400 --> 04:11.360
reality. Another bad reason is that you want to have more impact. Honestly, just join an

04:11.360 --> 04:14.920
early stage start-up. You're going to be working on a product that's already well-funded, doing

04:14.920 --> 04:20.680
well. You're going to grow with the team, become the CTO maybe. It's a great path. Or

04:20.680 --> 04:26.640
a late stage company. I worked at Samsung. My code is being used by millions and millions

04:26.640 --> 04:30.640
of people, or at least devices. That's much more impact than any of my companies have

04:30.640 --> 04:36.200
reached so far. So that's just something to keep in mind. Another thing, you want to get

04:36.200 --> 04:41.640
rich. That's not a good reason because the likelihood of success is very low. You're

04:41.640 --> 04:45.560
most likely going to have a really low salary for many years and then you're going to go

04:45.560 --> 04:50.680
bust. Not a good strategy if you want to make money. Again, join an early stage start-up.

04:50.680 --> 04:56.800
April 50 at Facebook, for example, is a multi, multi, multi-millionaire. Or just work at

04:56.800 --> 05:00.680
Facebook, Google, all of those companies. Again, I don't recommend, but if this is what

05:00.680 --> 05:04.920
you want and you're just chasing money, you can do that. And you have to remember it's

05:04.920 --> 05:09.680
going to be absolutely brutal. So things are going to go wrong. Deals are going to fall

05:09.680 --> 05:12.880
through. You're going to get a lot of no's from candidates, from investors, from literally

05:12.880 --> 05:17.000
everyone all the time. You're going to want to quit. But because you're the founder, that

05:17.000 --> 05:20.360
means that if you quit, the company is going to close. And that means your employees are

05:20.360 --> 05:23.000
going to lose their job and your investors are going to lose the money invested. So you're

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
going to really like, it's really hard to quit as a founder.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.920
Okay, so we covered all the budget stuff. So why actually start a start-up? And there

05:31.920 --> 05:35.960
are a few good reasons. One, you really care about the problem. You want to cure cancer.

05:35.960 --> 05:40.480
No one else has cracked it yet. You think you have a shot? Go for it. You're really

05:40.480 --> 05:44.600
passionate about your idea. You have, I don't know, Uber for cats. Terrible idea. But this

05:44.600 --> 05:48.720
is something that you really care about. And you want to get, you know, because everyone

05:48.720 --> 05:52.360
thinks it's terrible, I guess, for the laughs, no one else is going to build it. You decide

05:52.360 --> 05:57.160
to build it yourself. And you just want to start maybe your own company. You just, I

05:57.160 --> 06:01.600
don't know, whatever reason, this is what you want to do. Just make sure that your motivation

06:01.600 --> 06:06.360
is long-lasting because you're going to need it for the next ten years.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.120
Another good reason, a bit more altruistic, is that open-source start-ups are good for

06:10.120 --> 06:15.800
the community. Much more money and talent into open-source, great open-source products.

06:15.800 --> 06:20.440
We all going to use them every day. And also, open-source start-ups tend to support the

06:20.440 --> 06:24.800
rest of the community. We support other projects both financially and by upstreaming patches.

06:24.800 --> 06:30.940
We also employ the maintainer of, like, Redis Rust. And, again, great for the ecosystem.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.400
But you have to remember, there are other alternatives. You can join a promising start-up.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.720
You can start a non-VC backed start-up. Much less of the stress that I mentioned. You can

06:39.720 --> 06:43.960
start a side business. I've done that. It's great. Much less stressful. Still stressful,

06:43.960 --> 06:48.600
but much less. Or you can just start an open-source project. Again, I've done that. Many people

06:48.600 --> 06:52.840
in this room have done it as well. It's a great way to just put something out there

06:52.840 --> 06:57.560
without the pressure of actually having returns. So really just be true to yourself of what

06:57.560 --> 07:03.240
you want, because you need to know what you're signing up for.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.840
So let's talk about getting started. The first step in the journey is validating your idea.

07:07.840 --> 07:11.840
So is this a problem that people even care about? Are you the right team to build it?

07:11.840 --> 07:15.000
How will you make money? How will you get customers? How big is the opportunity? You

07:15.000 --> 07:19.060
need to constantly validate your riskiest assumptions in order to not go head-on the

07:19.060 --> 07:23.640
wrong direction. I highly recommend filling in the Y Combinator application. Y Combinator

07:23.640 --> 07:30.200
is an accelerator. Even if you don't submit it, it just forces you to think very thoroughly

07:30.200 --> 07:33.560
about the business from the eyes of investors and from a business perspective. And it's

07:33.560 --> 07:37.400
been very helpful for me.

07:37.400 --> 07:43.960
You know how people say there are no bad ideas? There are definitely bad ideas. Some threads

07:43.960 --> 07:50.520
of common bad ideas are the ones that are very obvious. So for example, oh, I'm going

07:50.520 --> 07:55.200
to start a startup for teleportation. Great idea. I'm sure all of you guys are going to

07:55.200 --> 07:59.360
pay instead of taking the flight back home. But the problem is it's actually technically

07:59.360 --> 08:05.200
difficult or impossible. That's why no one has started it. So it's the first step of

08:05.200 --> 08:06.440
validation.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.360
The other type of ideas is when you have a solution, you built a project, you're really

08:10.360 --> 08:14.600
excited by it. That's what you want to work on. Problem is it's not applicable to everything.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.440
I don't have a good example from the top of my head, but there are many of them. And I'm

08:18.440 --> 08:26.920
sure the more crypto, God haters, we'll use the cryptos as an example for that.

08:26.920 --> 08:34.440
Also another one, I get pitched a lot of ideas about spaces that the 2B founders know nothing

08:34.440 --> 08:39.920
about. I know nothing about cancer research. I'm not going to start a cancer research company.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.880
And one last thing which is actually not a bad signal, people telling you that it's bad.

08:43.880 --> 08:48.240
That's going back to why it doesn't exist because everyone thinks it's bad. And that's

08:48.240 --> 08:53.120
where your opportunity lies. So just ignore the naysayers.

08:53.120 --> 08:59.800
I asked Paul, the cofounder and CEO of Superbase, what is his best advice? And he said everything

08:59.800 --> 09:03.400
should be open source, but not every open source should be a business. And that's so

09:03.400 --> 09:09.800
true. Again, validate, verify what you're building is actually a good business.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.560
In the now immortal words of Y Combinator, you need to make something that people want.

09:14.560 --> 09:20.440
That's it. So when you start, all you need to be focusing on is writing code, showing

09:20.440 --> 09:24.720
it to customers, getting feedback, talking to them, all of that. In the open source world,

09:24.720 --> 09:29.760
we release early, release often. That's how you get things to the hands of customers or

09:29.760 --> 09:34.280
users and you get feedback. It's much better to find a few that really love what you're

09:34.280 --> 09:39.680
doing than many people that are, because the few that love, really love it, are going to

09:39.680 --> 09:43.240
tell their friends about it. And the few that are okay about it are going to stop using

09:43.240 --> 09:49.720
it after a certain period of time. Also, 90-10 solution. So find how you make the most impact

09:49.720 --> 09:54.120
with the less amount of time. Like perfection is really the enemy of good here.

09:54.120 --> 09:58.960
And the last thing, you want to do things that don't scale. So what do I mean by that?

09:58.960 --> 10:02.360
There are certain activities that you can do at this stage of the company that are definitely

10:02.360 --> 10:06.600
not going to work once you have a billion users. But for now, you can do them. So one

10:06.600 --> 10:13.520
example from the beginning of Svix is that I used to send the API keys encrypted to our

10:13.520 --> 10:17.080
customers. We didn't have a sign-up flow. There was no need, right? I don't know if

10:17.080 --> 10:21.120
even anyone wants the company or wants the product. So why build the sign-up role? Why

10:21.120 --> 10:24.840
build the landing page? None of these things matter in the beginning. So just focus on

10:24.840 --> 10:29.160
the product. Another great quote that I love is from Steve

10:29.160 --> 10:34.080
Jobs. So everything around you that you call life was made by people that were no smarter

10:34.080 --> 10:38.400
than you are. And you can change it, you can influence it, and you can build your own things

10:38.400 --> 10:42.720
that other people can use. So it's really don't be scared because it looks, you know,

10:42.720 --> 10:48.160
it seems difficult. Just like go for it. Really just go for it.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.920
So before you start, ignore the naysayers, but be honest with yourself. You know, a lot

10:52.920 --> 10:56.400
of people are going to tell you what you're doing is stupid, silly, bad decision. Maybe

10:56.400 --> 11:01.880
they're right. You have to make that call. Effort counts for nothing. This is not school.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.320
If you don't get results, it doesn't matter how hard you work. It doesn't matter how much

11:05.320 --> 11:09.040
you tried. It doesn't matter how cool your code is. It just doesn't matter.

11:09.040 --> 11:14.000
Again, de-risk the business. You have to listen to advice but decide for yourself. First of

11:14.000 --> 11:17.720
all, it's because it's practice for later stages. You're the only one running this company.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.160
But also, you're the only one with a lot of context about what your customers want because

11:21.160 --> 11:23.760
you've been talking to them all the time. And what doesn't work because you've been

11:23.760 --> 11:28.240
writing the code. So really just decide for yourself. And remember that most startups

11:28.240 --> 11:32.920
fail. Like the vast majority. So if you're doing average input, you're going to get average

11:32.920 --> 11:38.040
output and that means death for a startup. So definitely watch out for that.

11:38.040 --> 11:43.000
Okay. I think that was like the beginning. Now we can talk a bit about the product. So

11:43.000 --> 11:48.280
the first and most important thing is understanding the problem. You need to know your customers,

11:48.280 --> 11:52.240
what they want, what they care about, what they hate. You really have the curiosity of

11:52.240 --> 11:57.080
a child and really get to have as most empathy as you can. A good hack in the beginning is

11:57.080 --> 12:00.920
being your own customer. That really works. But you also have to make sure that there's

12:00.920 --> 12:04.600
a path to other customers that are different than you are. Because if you're just building

12:04.600 --> 12:09.240
a name tag that just says the name Tom on them, that's great. But there's just so many

12:09.240 --> 12:13.760
Tom's in the world. I don't think it's a good business.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.840
Another quote, I love quotes, is from Henry Ford. It's asked people what I wanted. They

12:17.840 --> 12:24.120
would have asked for a faster horse. And that means don't, you know, listen to your customers,

12:24.120 --> 12:28.200
learn about their needs and wants, but don't follow blindly. Say no. It's absolutely fine

12:28.200 --> 12:33.920
to say no. You also have to remember it's about what you do. It's not about what you

12:33.920 --> 12:38.000
do, sorry. It's about what you enable. So people don't actually care about drills. I

12:38.000 --> 12:41.840
mean, drills are fun. Don't get me wrong. But what they want is holes. And you have

12:41.840 --> 12:46.000
to figure out how you give them a hole. And again, don't obsess on the fact that you already

12:46.000 --> 12:52.440
have a drill. And another part about this, as you know, we talked about product. And

12:52.440 --> 12:57.840
that kind of implies, you know, what people actually use. But really, when I asked James

12:57.840 --> 13:01.480
about his experience, he said something that really resonated, which is your old company

13:01.480 --> 13:08.000
is the product. And actually, Zeno also concurred. And from my own experience, like, it's I've

13:08.000 --> 13:11.880
lost count the amount of products that I really wanted to try. And I went to their website

13:11.880 --> 13:14.400
and I couldn't understand really what they're doing. But I thought maybe it's relevant.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.120
And I went to their docs, couldn't understand how to get it started, and just dropped off,

13:18.120 --> 13:21.520
even though I'm sure it's actually the perfect product for me. And it's the same with every

13:21.520 --> 13:28.020
other aspect. So, you know, like, marketing, customer success, all of those kind of things.

13:28.020 --> 13:32.640
You have to obsess with a customer experience. So obviously have great customer service,

13:32.640 --> 13:36.480
as I mentioned, you know, your wife's birthday, but the customer is calling, you may need

13:36.480 --> 13:40.960
to like drop for a few minutes. And but much better than having a great customer service

13:40.960 --> 13:45.440
is actually fixing the docs. Like, why do they even have a problem in the first place?

13:45.440 --> 13:49.720
But even better than fixing the docs is just make the product easy to use. So, you know,

13:49.720 --> 13:54.600
same defaults, great onboarding in the product itself. And all of those things make for a

13:54.600 --> 13:59.000
much better experience. Now, I know this doesn't need repeating and

13:59.000 --> 14:01.860
fostering them, you know, just like looking in this room or looking even outside with

14:01.860 --> 14:06.120
all the stands that the amazing communities that are powering, you know, this whole event,

14:06.120 --> 14:09.360
but maintaining a healthy community really matters for an open source project, because

14:09.360 --> 14:11.960
that's how you get contributors, that's how you get evangelism, that's how you get all

14:11.960 --> 14:18.800
of those things that later on turn into business goals. As I said, capitalistic talk. I'm not

14:18.800 --> 14:22.400
as cynical in real life, but I'm just like trying just showing you the connections to

14:22.400 --> 14:27.000
business value. And so be quick to respond to PRs. The most

14:27.000 --> 14:31.360
annoying thing I opened a PR like two years ago, got a got feedback a few months ago,

14:31.360 --> 14:36.280
obviously never fixed the feedback. I mean, that's ridiculous. There are tools to help

14:36.280 --> 14:40.320
to make sure that you maintain a good community like orbit love and also the community dev

14:40.320 --> 14:45.120
room here at Fostom. Okay. So we talked about a product which maybe

14:45.120 --> 14:48.960
some of you know, maybe some of you already built a successful open source project. But

14:48.960 --> 14:52.040
now the you know, what now what we need to remember is that we're actually building a

14:52.040 --> 14:57.720
business. And we're no longer just engineers. And we should focus our time on non-engineering

14:57.720 --> 15:01.520
tasks, which is so hard. And I'm going to talk about that in a boat in a bit. But the

15:01.520 --> 15:06.520
first step is understanding your business model. And what is a business model is just

15:06.520 --> 15:10.740
a fancy way of saying how are you actually going to make money? There are many different

15:10.740 --> 15:15.080
models for open source and many different models for non open source. You know, Red

15:15.080 --> 15:19.720
Hat and canonical and they're a great example of selling additional services. So training,

15:19.720 --> 15:26.540
support, consulting, packaging, so like packages literally. And another example is open core.

15:26.540 --> 15:30.660
So you release some of the source code as open source and then proprietary stuff on

15:30.660 --> 15:37.400
top. GitLab and Redis both do it. Again, very common. Dual licensing, Suqute and FreeBaidai

15:37.400 --> 15:42.160
do it. So you have licensed your code as copy left or something that is not compatible with

15:42.160 --> 15:45.920
some companies. And then they pay you an extra fee to kind of like unlock it and get an enterprise

15:45.920 --> 15:53.120
contract. And then you have managed cloud, SaaS, oftentimes goes hand in hand with open

15:53.120 --> 16:00.400
core when you have the features only in the SaaS product and again for the enterprise.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.120
But MongoDB both do it. You can either run a multi-tenant SaaS or you can just run the

16:05.120 --> 16:10.720
product for them. And there was a time that open core was the way to go and then SaaS

16:10.720 --> 16:14.520
became the way to go because, you know, the advent of the cloud. And actually open core

16:14.520 --> 16:18.520
is getting some traction again because a lot of people want to sell phones, you know, with

16:18.520 --> 16:23.160
GDPR, with data sovereignty, all of those kind of things. People are looking to sell

16:23.160 --> 16:29.440
phones again. And then another one that's not often talked about is supporting products

16:29.440 --> 16:33.280
and services. So that's kind of like similar to open core. But you're not actually extending

16:33.280 --> 16:38.240
the product but you're providing services on top of it. So good examples are GitHub.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.920
GitHub is open source. GitHub has nothing to do with open source. But they're riding on

16:41.920 --> 16:47.160
the Git success. And Android, Google is selling services over an operating system that was

16:47.160 --> 16:55.280
open and can be customizable by many of the, you know, but all the other phone manufacturers.

16:55.280 --> 16:59.560
You can also combine multiple models. But you should know what your main driver is.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.920
You're an early stage start-up. You probably have like one person or more likely 0.1 person

17:03.920 --> 17:08.280
like working on this stuff. So you really need to focus and see what's the main driver

17:08.280 --> 17:12.880
for you. And now because you're building a billion-dollar business, you're going to have

17:12.880 --> 17:17.200
a lot of competition. Other people are going to see your success, are going to see your

17:17.200 --> 17:23.280
opportunity. We have numerous copycats that have launched since we started. And you have

17:23.280 --> 17:27.680
to figure out how do you protect yourself. So there are a few common ways for open source

17:27.680 --> 17:34.040
projects. One way is the license, obviously. I'm sure those need no introduction here.

17:34.040 --> 17:40.120
Copy left, so GPL. The problem with those is that oftentimes they're not liked by enterprise

17:40.120 --> 17:45.280
lawyers. So it's really hard to sell to an enterprise if GPL is just banned from that

17:45.280 --> 17:49.440
enterprise. So that's something to watch out for. Then you have the permissive ones, which

17:49.440 --> 17:54.200
is what we chose, but they don't provide any protection. And then you have the non-free

17:54.200 --> 18:00.440
or fopen, obviously not open source. I understand where they're coming from. Like, seeing AWS

18:00.440 --> 18:05.280
just take your business, host it, and then take all of your revenue stream probably is

18:05.280 --> 18:08.960
not fun. I don't know what I would have done in that situation, but it's definitely...

18:08.960 --> 18:14.360
I can see how there's going to be more innovation in the licensing space just following the

18:14.360 --> 18:20.640
mega cloud companies. And the last one is usually... It's like CLA is usually tied with

18:20.640 --> 18:24.240
a copyright assignment. And then when you do do a licensing, you need to actually own

18:24.240 --> 18:31.480
the copyright. So contributors assign the copyright to you, and then you can re-license.

18:31.480 --> 18:37.400
If I asked multiple lawyers and founders, and almost all of them said, own the trademark,

18:37.400 --> 18:42.160
your license is probably too liberal to protect you. And the trademark is the reason why Mozilla

18:42.160 --> 18:48.200
can say, well, you know, like, can prevent a competitor from starting Firefox++ or Firefox

18:48.200 --> 18:51.760
Remix, all of those kind of things, because that is actually confusing to customers. And

18:51.760 --> 18:57.280
that's a good line of defense. I think like a few years ago, the founder of OwnCloud actually

18:57.280 --> 19:01.800
gave a talk here at Forstem, and he mentioned that they never had the trademark for OwnCloud,

19:01.800 --> 19:06.880
and that prevented them from actually offering a good hosted service, because there were

19:06.880 --> 19:12.760
so many clones, and there were so many people that claimed to be the official one, and it

19:12.760 --> 19:18.920
was like really hard for them to actually maintain control. Another one is network effects

19:18.920 --> 19:23.800
and ecosystem. So if you look at GitLab or even GitHub, even though it's not open source,

19:23.800 --> 19:27.280
just because everyone is there, that means the new projects are going to be hosted there

19:27.280 --> 19:33.840
as well. That's it. It's really tough to break. But even without a SaaS component, just think

19:33.840 --> 19:38.360
about Postgres. There's so many libraries for Postgres and so many utilities for Postgres

19:38.360 --> 19:43.840
across many languages and across many, like, the ecosystem is vast, so it's really hard

19:43.840 --> 19:49.800
to append Postgres from like where they are. So that's like, again, another good line of

19:49.800 --> 19:56.200
defense. Also remember, you know, plans are worthless. Everything is going to change. You're

19:56.200 --> 19:59.920
going to change your assumption. Everything, it's really in flux. Like, it's hard to understand

19:59.920 --> 20:06.200
like how much things, sorry, how to explain how many things change on a single day. But

20:06.200 --> 20:10.680
actually the process of planning is extremely valuable. You know, I'm going to say a word

20:10.680 --> 20:15.040
that probably sounds scary, which is like financial modeling, but it's really you just

20:15.040 --> 20:19.400
go and download a spreadsheet, fill a few values, change like it to, you know, to whatever

20:19.400 --> 20:23.480
you need, and that will provide you a lot of insight into the levers that actually move

20:23.480 --> 20:28.080
your business. So if, for example, you want to charge people $5 and you think you're going

20:28.080 --> 20:33.440
to be able to reach 2,000 customers, that means that you're going to make $10,000 a

20:33.440 --> 20:37.880
month. Maybe enough for you, maybe not enough to sustain a business, but now you know, maybe

20:37.880 --> 20:41.840
you need to increase the price or maybe you need to have a different business model. So

20:41.840 --> 20:46.840
really just the process of planning is extremely valuable. Now that you know the plan, you

20:46.840 --> 20:49.960
kind of know how you're going to make money, it's very important to assess the business

20:49.960 --> 20:56.160
opportunity. One common wrong way to do it is to say, well, you know, the software industry

20:56.160 --> 21:01.040
is vast, it's $1 trillion. If we do really well, Microsoft has 5% of it, if we do really

21:01.040 --> 21:05.960
well, we can go to 1%, and that's a lot of money. Realistically, that just doesn't make

21:05.960 --> 21:10.520
sense, and there's like so many variables that are hidden here that, you know, it just

21:10.520 --> 21:16.280
doesn't add any insights. Like the much better way to do it is bottoms up analysis. So it's

21:16.280 --> 21:19.840
essentially you saying, well, you know, we make $5 out of each customer. I think we can

21:19.840 --> 21:24.040
get to a million customers next year, and then 5 million five years after, and then

21:24.040 --> 21:27.880
100 million 10 years after. And you're probably not going to hit 100 million or probably going

21:27.880 --> 21:31.480
to change some stuff in the business, that's fine. But just understanding that where you're

21:31.480 --> 21:36.520
heading is a $500 million a year business, that already gives you enough of context and

21:36.520 --> 21:40.560
like gives you investors enough context to know what it is, you know, what kind of business

21:40.560 --> 21:46.120
that you have. It's also important to ask, are you really selling $2 for $1? Like is

21:46.120 --> 21:51.280
your business model is like a losing model? So those are a bit more advanced questions.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.720
It's better to just do the market sizing in the beginning, but that's just something to

21:53.720 --> 22:00.200
keep in mind. And when asked here from Cal.com, like the open source, I don't know if you

22:00.200 --> 22:05.240
know this one. And his top advice, he said that as an open source startup, you actually

22:05.240 --> 22:12.320
need a 10x TAM. TAM is total addressable market. So like the what I said in 10 years, 100 million.

22:12.320 --> 22:16.760
And what he was saying by that is, you know, you're cannibalizing your own business. If

22:16.760 --> 22:20.000
you have a successful open source project, people are going to self-host it, but at least

22:20.000 --> 22:25.480
I hope. And that means that you're competing with, you know, the most formidable competitor.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.880
They're always going to be at least as good as you are. And you're going to lose, right?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.800
So you have to understand that some people are not going to buy the, you know, the extra

22:32.800 --> 22:39.120
paid product. And that's important to keep in mind. I asked Nick from QuestDB, like his

22:39.120 --> 22:44.000
perspective, and for them, they're delaying monetization, actually not charging money.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.320
And that I know, like the reason why I wanted to highlight this one is that that's often

22:47.320 --> 22:50.760
a point of really cool about startups, like, oh, you know, this startup is losing like

22:50.760 --> 22:55.000
$10 million a year. But what you have to understand is that there are two kinds of losses. There

22:55.000 --> 22:58.320
are the losses that don't make sense, and you're just burning money for no good reason.

22:58.320 --> 23:03.040
And then the losses that are part of a strategy, like Nick's, which is saying, you know, we

23:03.040 --> 23:06.840
are only valuable if we actually have an X system around us. We're only valuable if people

23:06.840 --> 23:11.440
actually use the product. And after that, we can figure out ways to make money. We already

23:11.440 --> 23:17.640
know how we're going to make money, but we can defer that. Okay. Now we can talk about

23:17.640 --> 23:23.000
go to market. Again, fancy way of saying getting customers. You know, you have to remember

23:23.000 --> 23:26.780
that at the end of the day, you're a business, and you need to make money, and paying customers

23:26.780 --> 23:32.800
are your business. Again, you can start by non-paying in the beginning, but you need customers.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.680
One common way of thinking about it is if you build it, they will come. It worked in

23:37.680 --> 23:41.800
the past, but it probably not going to work for you. It worked for Linux because that

23:41.800 --> 23:46.880
was the first open source operating system. It worked for KDE. It worked for a lot of

23:46.880 --> 23:51.400
Linux distributions. But realistically for you, you're going to have a lot of competition,

23:51.400 --> 23:55.720
and people most likely, like the market is most likely very saturated. So people are

23:55.720 --> 24:02.800
not just going to show up. So what you can do, though, is do things that don't scale,

24:02.800 --> 24:09.040
again, as we said earlier. What does that mean? You know people. Ask, you know, email

24:09.040 --> 24:15.200
200 people from your contact list to try your product. Or you're here at Fosdom, just go

24:15.200 --> 24:19.040
to a relevant area or a relevant dev room and just chat to people and just ask them

24:19.040 --> 24:22.680
to try your product. There are a lot of easy ways that are definitely not going to work.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.040
That's not how you're going to get to 100 million customers, but that's how you're

24:26.040 --> 24:29.960
going to get to your first 10. And you want to focus on the easy ones, like trying to

24:29.960 --> 24:33.520
sell to Amazon sounds like a very, you know, like, oh my God, they're going to pay me $10

24:33.520 --> 24:38.080
million a year. That's amazing. But realistically, it's going to take six months until you get

24:38.080 --> 24:42.680
anywhere and then it's going to fail. But even if it doesn't fail and you succeed, it

24:42.680 --> 24:45.280
took you a year and you're probably out of business by the time you even like manage

24:45.280 --> 24:51.120
to scratch the surface on that deal. And again, few that love you are much better than many

24:51.120 --> 24:59.720
who like. Go to market is a very common topic with both technical and open source developers.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.520
The reason why is because we're technical. We don't we don't think about marketing. We

25:03.520 --> 25:07.560
don't think about sales. We don't think about those things. And so a lot of people had a

25:07.560 --> 25:13.120
lot of feedback about that one ship as early as possible. Another one learn marketing.

25:13.120 --> 25:17.280
Another one. And, you know, if you're trying to sell to companies, maybe start by getting

25:17.280 --> 25:21.040
the individuals at home first, because that's much easier than getting the approval and

25:21.040 --> 25:26.800
the contract and all of that going on. Now that you kind of like you're starting to get

25:26.800 --> 25:31.720
customers, you know, there's some traction. You actually have to, you know, have some

25:31.720 --> 25:36.200
metrics. And by metrics, I don't mean Google Analytics and like tracking your customers.

25:36.200 --> 25:43.000
I really just mean like knowing our our things are even going the right way. And so it also

25:43.000 --> 25:46.040
actually like if you know if you're tracking the important things, you can also affect

25:46.040 --> 25:49.960
them. You can know revenue is not growing as much as we wanted. I guess we can, you

25:49.960 --> 25:54.720
know, do something about it. And so you really want to track the most important parts of

25:54.720 --> 26:00.120
the business. Often revenue, but, you know, some precursor to revenue can be, you know,

26:00.120 --> 26:04.960
can be a good one as well. And it's really easy to go for vanity metrics. One of the

26:04.960 --> 26:08.320
founders, I'm not going to put I didn't put a quote from him, but he said that they were

26:08.320 --> 26:13.640
tracking PyPy downloads. So like the Python package manager. That sounds great. The problem

26:13.640 --> 26:17.880
is, again, like CI, all of those kind of bots, all of those things actually download packages

26:17.880 --> 26:21.680
from there as well. And they thought they had a lot of traction, but actually had nothing.

26:21.680 --> 26:26.680
So that's something to keep in mind. So there's some good metrics that you can use. You know,

26:26.680 --> 26:31.760
revenue is always king if you're making money. Great. And but also number of customers using

26:31.760 --> 26:36.800
your production. So a few big companies that everyone knows are already using you to, you

26:36.800 --> 26:40.480
know, to serve millions of customers. That's that's something. Even if you're not making

26:40.480 --> 26:46.160
money now, you can probably make money later. Some insufficient ones are GitHub stars, sign

26:46.160 --> 26:52.040
ups, downloads, Twitter followers, you know, GitHub star is really just someone clicked,

26:52.040 --> 26:56.400
clicked the button. Maybe that someone is a target customer. Maybe not sign ups. Maybe

26:56.400 --> 26:59.080
they signed up and then they dropped because they realized it's not even the product that

26:59.080 --> 27:03.280
they want. You know, they're like a lot of really false signals here. And also GitHub

27:03.280 --> 27:08.120
stars don't mean that you have a great business. So this one has like 240,000 stars, like one

27:08.120 --> 27:12.160
of the tops starred repos, but it's it's a set of tutorials and maybe it's a great business.

27:12.160 --> 27:17.440
I don't know, maybe they can spin it into something. And but it's definitely not a business

27:17.440 --> 27:23.480
on its face value. And but a lot of stars can definitely indicate that you're onto something.

27:23.480 --> 27:28.800
And this is from Superbase. They're at 40,000 stars and they're just growing like crazy.

27:28.800 --> 27:35.520
Every year consistently for two, two years, I guess, that's something. And that's just

27:35.520 --> 27:40.960
like an indication of the market share that they're gaining with developers. So I guess

27:40.960 --> 27:44.880
the main question that we need to ask is whether we should even open source. I talked about

27:44.880 --> 27:48.240
all of that. And before you boo me off stage, and I know this is not the right place to

27:48.240 --> 27:52.360
ask this question, but like, you have to understand it's actually a business decision. At the

27:52.360 --> 27:56.680
end of the day, you took money from investors, you promised them to return them more money,

27:56.680 --> 28:00.120
you got people on board, offered them a job and told them that you're going to be around

28:00.120 --> 28:05.480
for five years. So you have to make the best decision for your business. And there are

28:05.480 --> 28:10.840
reasons for both doing it and not doing it. And so one thing is your customers even care.

28:10.840 --> 28:16.240
Maybe not. Maybe they don't even know what open source is. I don't even know. I don't

28:16.240 --> 28:19.240
want to go with some cliche, but they just have no idea what open source is and they

28:19.240 --> 28:24.320
couldn't care less. Is there a business advantage to being open source? So, for example, when

28:24.320 --> 28:29.400
you're a developer tool, that means that people can try your product more easily. That's great.

28:29.400 --> 28:36.440
Maybe go open source. And does it even make businesses? Are you just going to cut yourself?

28:36.440 --> 28:41.800
Or just kill your own business? So ideology is fine. I've done it for ideology as well

28:41.800 --> 28:45.520
with Ettesync. It started as an open source project. But you just have to remember that

28:45.520 --> 28:52.160
at the end of the day, you're building a business. So there are definitely upsides. Engaged community

28:52.160 --> 28:56.520
really helps. Again, so many volunteers outside handing out flyers about projects, really

28:56.520 --> 29:01.240
promoting them. You can also hire from the community. No need to find great developers

29:01.240 --> 29:05.120
if you already have developers that know your code base and have been contributing code.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.800
Service trust, healthy communication that comes with open source, easier adoption, as

29:09.800 --> 29:15.320
I said, with dev tools. And also the product is just more flexible. People can just fork

29:15.320 --> 29:21.640
it and adjust it to whatever they need. There are also downsides, though. Balanced community

29:21.640 --> 29:26.880
and business needs. Does this one go to the open source product or does this stay as propriety

29:26.880 --> 29:32.640
extensions? Maintainer burnout is a good topic. It's a very front of mind topic for a lot

29:32.640 --> 29:37.120
of people nowadays. And it's absolutely true. And the same with support, right? People asking

29:37.120 --> 29:41.080
questions about your product on GitHub, you want to make sure you're going to give them

29:41.080 --> 29:43.920
the best support possible. But they're not paying you in the end. So you're doing a lot

29:43.920 --> 29:48.440
of free support, which is fine. It's part of being a project. But also it can be overwhelming

29:48.440 --> 29:54.000
at times. It's really hard to say no to things because everything is in the open. And also

29:54.000 --> 29:59.600
like startups win on speed. You really have to compete and move fast. And enabling self-hosting

29:59.600 --> 30:02.520
and doing like database migration, seamless migration, all of those kind of things just

30:02.520 --> 30:06.640
makes things so much harder. And maintaining code bases, which you have to do because you

30:06.640 --> 30:11.000
have going to have customizations for specific customers or you're going to have hacks for

30:11.000 --> 30:14.320
specific customers. You're going to have a ticketing system where you're going to say,

30:14.320 --> 30:18.680
well, you know, customer X asked for this. We have to finish it now. You're not going

30:18.680 --> 30:23.200
to be able to do that in the open just because your customers wouldn't want that. And also

30:23.200 --> 30:27.400
your secret sauce may be public. And you're really just undercutting yourself on price,

30:27.400 --> 30:34.560
and people can just self-host. So there are downsides. Another quote that I like is by

30:34.560 --> 30:40.200
Joseph Jax. He said that don't open source something you don't want to commoditize because

30:40.200 --> 30:43.800
you're open sourcing your secret sauce, you're open sourcing all of the internal structure.

30:43.800 --> 30:48.080
It's actually really easy to mimic or even fork, but definitely to mimic what you're

30:48.080 --> 30:51.600
building. So just assume it's a commodity the moment you release it and make sure that

30:51.600 --> 30:57.880
the stuff that you don't want to be a commodity, they stay proprietary. Okay. So now we can

30:57.880 --> 31:02.920
talk about fundraising. I know this is something that people are often mystified by, even just

31:02.920 --> 31:07.480
by the amount of people that asked me about it in the last 48 hours alone. So happy to

31:07.480 --> 31:14.520
cover a bit of it. So the first thing is that you're dealing with investors. And when you're

31:14.520 --> 31:17.600
dealing with people, you have to understand what do they actually care about and understand

31:17.600 --> 31:23.720
how they think. So the first thing to understand is the power law of venture capital investments.

31:23.720 --> 31:31.080
What does that mean? Let's assume for simplicity that a fund invests in 100 companies. Most

31:31.080 --> 31:35.360
startups fail, so that means 90 are going to fail. And they invest a million in each.

31:35.360 --> 31:40.000
So 90 are going to fail. Okay. They already lost $90 million. And now they have 10 live

31:40.000 --> 31:45.400
companies. Let's say five of them are going to return, sorry, eight of them are going

31:45.400 --> 31:50.080
to return 5x. Okay. That's a good outcome. They invested for a certain amount of money.

31:50.080 --> 31:55.160
It's now worth 5x that amount. Great return. So that's $40 million that they made. And

31:55.160 --> 32:01.680
then the last two, so they lost 90. They just made 40. So they're down 50. So the last two,

32:01.680 --> 32:05.480
the last two companies really need to carry the whole weight of the whole investment fund

32:05.480 --> 32:10.440
to actually make a return. So that means the last two probably need to return 100x each.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.520
So if they invested at a value of 10 million, it needs to be worth a billion now. And it

32:14.520 --> 32:18.960
really the old venture model is based on the fact they're trying to find these one or two

32:18.960 --> 32:23.960
companies in their whole fund that is going to be 100x. You know, Facebook was a 2000xer

32:23.960 --> 32:28.000
or something like that. Uber as well. Like there are companies that are definitely outliers.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.120
Apple, I guess, as well if you, you know, you look at the whole 30 years at a time.

32:34.120 --> 32:40.400
So the moment you understand that they don't care about your 5x, because that 5x was $40

32:40.400 --> 32:45.480
million out of the 240 that they made, you really have to like position yourself as that

32:45.480 --> 32:51.760
100xer. And you also have to understand that they have investors. So even though you're

32:51.760 --> 32:55.600
talking to that person and they love what you're doing and they're like, you know, they're

32:55.600 --> 32:59.580
open source developers themselves. They really want the product, whatever. They have investors

32:59.580 --> 33:02.560
to answer for. They told them, hey, I'm going to invest your money and I'm going to give

33:02.560 --> 33:07.880
you that amount of return. And so really you have to make sure, you know, to understand

33:07.880 --> 33:13.680
that dynamic. It's also, it's their job. I mean, here I wrote, you know, stay in touch,

33:13.680 --> 33:17.400
but really it's their job to waste your time. And they want to like meet you. They want

33:17.400 --> 33:20.400
to like know more about the space because they're going to invest in a competitor and

33:20.400 --> 33:23.820
they really want to understand the space better. They want to know about all the cool companies

33:23.820 --> 33:27.160
so they can tell their friends at the country club that, I mean, that was maybe a bit of

33:27.160 --> 33:30.880
an extreme joke, but they want to tell their friends that they've talked to all of these

33:30.880 --> 33:34.920
cool companies that are just doing very well now. This is not your job. Your job is to

33:34.920 --> 33:40.360
build a company, not to waste your time talking to investors. Another thing to remember is

33:40.360 --> 33:47.160
that not a yes is a no. So investors want to invest in the really good companies. As

33:47.160 --> 33:51.760
I said, they want to invest in the 100Xer. It's really hard to know if this company is

33:51.760 --> 33:54.800
that. So what they're going to say, they're not going to say, well, no, this is stupid.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.240
I'm not going to invest in you. What they're going to say is like, oh my God, this sounds

33:57.240 --> 34:01.040
amazing. I need to build my conviction for a few weeks and I'm going to like do some

34:01.040 --> 34:04.200
research and I'm going to like talk to you then. And then they disappear. But if they

34:04.200 --> 34:08.320
see that some big name investor like is talking to you or like there's some traction there,

34:08.320 --> 34:11.440
then they're going to come back and tell and complain to you and say like, well, you know,

34:11.440 --> 34:14.800
I told you I was interested, but really what they said in the beginning was no, and you're

34:14.800 --> 34:17.360
never going to hear back from them again. So it's really important to count that as

34:17.360 --> 34:23.320
a no and not to count that as a yes. And another thing is that you want to believe the no,

34:23.320 --> 34:28.120
but not the why. So again, they want to invest in you, maybe not even in this company, but

34:28.120 --> 34:34.960
maybe in your next company. But they want to invest in the best companies. And if they're

34:34.960 --> 34:38.880
going to tell you, you suck, you know, you're not going to talk to them the next time. So

34:38.880 --> 34:44.040
they really want to say something nice like, oh, you know, this is our fund is like slowing

34:44.040 --> 34:47.440
down its investments so that really this is not the right time for us. But like, let's

34:47.440 --> 34:51.520
chat again in a couple of months. Really what they mean by that is leave me alone. I don't

34:51.520 --> 34:56.360
want to invest. And so like, don't like don't don't count it as a yes in a couple of months.

34:56.360 --> 35:01.680
Don't count it as a no, essentially. Also, like everything, it's a business, you want

35:01.680 --> 35:04.800
to have a plan, how much are you going to raise? What are you going to actually do with

35:04.800 --> 35:08.200
the money? Like, you know, it sounds good. I'm going to raise $2 million. But are you

35:08.200 --> 35:11.960
going to hire people? What are those people going to achieve? You know, figure those things

35:11.960 --> 35:16.680
out. How much of the money are you willing to sell? Are you willing to sell 90% of the

35:16.680 --> 35:20.040
company for $1 million? Are you willing to send 10? Those are all questions that you

35:20.040 --> 35:24.160
have to come in prepared for because you're dealing with professional negotiators that

35:24.160 --> 35:28.680
are going to repeat the shreds if you don't have like a strong stance on any of those.

35:28.680 --> 35:35.960
Another thing is to speak to investors all at once. So investors talk, as I mentioned,

35:35.960 --> 35:39.640
and they will talk about the cool companies that are chatting with. And if they're going

35:39.640 --> 35:43.120
to see that you've been trying like you've been talking to investors for the last year,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.280
and you haven't raised around yet, that probably means you're tainted goods, and they're not

35:47.280 --> 35:52.080
going to want to invest in you as well. So then the right thing to do is probably try

35:52.080 --> 35:55.560
to invest money, like raise capital for like two, three months. And after that, if that

35:55.560 --> 35:59.760
doesn't work out, just stop, go back to building a business. You know, if you're a developer,

35:59.760 --> 36:02.720
you probably don't need that money anyway. You can just continue building the product,

36:02.720 --> 36:08.960
and then I come back stronger in a few months. And, you know, I'm going to rush this one

36:08.960 --> 36:13.640
a bit, but like if you want to find investors, start with angels. You know, don't chase Sequoia.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.440
They're not going to invest in a small company or like they very rarely do. Don't waste your

36:17.440 --> 36:23.400
time. Build traction with angels, like small checks. And find people that are excited by

36:23.400 --> 36:28.000
the space, invest in similar companies, ask your friends. But really the most important

36:28.000 --> 36:33.160
thing is don't take intros from investors who haven't invested. Investors want to look

36:33.160 --> 36:35.800
good, and again, they want to look like they know all the companies. So they're going to

36:35.800 --> 36:39.000
tell you, hey, I'm going to introduce you. I know a guy, Sequoia. I'm going to introduce

36:39.000 --> 36:44.200
you to him. I know a girl, they're that fund. But really what happens is that if they haven't

36:44.200 --> 36:48.480
invested in you themselves, they're just signals to Sequoia that you've attained good because

36:48.480 --> 36:51.720
they wouldn't want to invest in you. So like why should they? So that's a really bad strategy

36:51.720 --> 36:58.800
to accept those intros. Just say that you're cool. You already have enough traction and

36:58.800 --> 37:03.320
interest. But once they invest, by all means, that's the strongest signal. Someone put their

37:03.320 --> 37:07.880
money on you. Have them introduce, have them go on a building and shout to the world that

37:07.880 --> 37:16.200
have invested and get introductions from them. This is actually where I see founders error

37:16.200 --> 37:20.320
the most. Not because maybe that's the most common place for mistakes. It's just the place

37:20.320 --> 37:25.600
that I'm exposed to the most. Is there a dex in their pitch? You want to really keep it

37:25.600 --> 37:31.000
short. You want them asking for more, not going through 80 pages of boring stuff about

37:31.000 --> 37:36.480
whatever. You want to keep it short, short, short. 10, maybe 15 slides. Really on point.

37:36.480 --> 37:42.640
You want to highlight what's most impressive. In your case, it's probably team, maybe idea.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.880
Maybe if you have a really impressive set of customers, that's great. Highlight that.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.880
But most likely you don't need to analyze your $2,000 a month revenue because, again,

37:50.880 --> 37:55.400
they don't care about that. It's not something that they see impressive. So focus on the

37:55.400 --> 38:00.560
stuff that are impressive. Another thing that people often get wrong is they confuse their

38:00.560 --> 38:05.280
customers with investors. So they go to the investor and assume the investor has the problem.

38:05.280 --> 38:09.120
The investor actually really cares about, I don't even know, I don't have an example

38:09.120 --> 38:13.480
at the top of my head. They really care about this topic. They understand the problem. They

38:13.480 --> 38:18.600
face it themselves. They really feel it. If you told them about all the research that

38:18.600 --> 38:22.520
they've done about this product and how you solve it, they're going to really be interested

38:22.520 --> 38:26.840
about that. The most likely scenario is that they don't even know what you're talking about.

38:26.840 --> 38:31.280
It's not their job to be subject matter experts in whatever it is esoteric thing that you're

38:31.280 --> 38:35.600
talking about. They just need you to demonstrate that there is a problem. People really care

38:35.600 --> 38:38.880
about that. People are going to pay you money. This is how much money you're going to make.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.520
This is how you're solving it. Not necessarily a disorder. This is who you are and why you're

38:42.520 --> 38:50.100
the best person or best team to solve it. And obviously, you want to know your business

38:50.100 --> 38:54.840
inside out. You want to be concise. So let them ask questions. Always iterate. After

38:54.840 --> 39:01.220
every call, I would go back and make sure that I get better after every call.

39:01.220 --> 39:06.040
Find the call. Be calm. Relax. Don't look desperate. They can sense desperation a mile

39:06.040 --> 39:10.040
away. When we were fundraising, I knew that worst case, I'm a developer. I can just build

39:10.040 --> 39:13.240
a product myself. I don't need that money. I would love to have it, but I don't need

39:13.240 --> 39:18.400
it. That kind of made it possible for me to relax and show that confidence that they're

39:18.400 --> 39:23.280
looking for. You're also assessing them. Ask questions. Figure out if you want to take

39:23.280 --> 39:28.240
their money because you're going to be with them for the long run if they're going to

39:28.240 --> 39:35.640
invest. So that's important. Also, only the CEO should go on calls. Don't do party conversations.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.320
First of all, just distraction. But also, you're going to get so many no's. It's much

39:39.320 --> 39:45.120
better that less people get pounded with all of these no's and the other people can actually

39:45.120 --> 39:53.240
focus on the business and continue. So the deal, this is mostly a slide for you to read

39:53.240 --> 39:56.800
afterwards, but there are a lot of topics. Is it simple? Is it fast? Or can you spend

39:56.800 --> 40:24.700
like 200,000 on lawyers in this deal? What are the terms for

40:24.700 --> 40:29.420
that? I don't want your services. I'm going to hire my own designers. That is such a ripoff

40:29.420 --> 40:36.240
if you ask me. Avoid those if you can. So final note about fundraising. You only need

40:36.240 --> 40:40.160
one yes. When preparing this talk, I was just like, I was thinking to my head, how many

40:40.160 --> 40:46.780
no's did I get when fundraising? Then I looked at my notes, it was closer to 50, but I really

40:46.780 --> 40:51.580
couldn't care less because that doesn't matter. You probably need more than one yes. You're

40:51.580 --> 40:53.040
probably gonna get like a few investors,

40:53.040 --> 40:56.240
but once you get a yes, the flywheel is rolling.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.940
Ignore the naysayers, ignore the assholes,

40:57.940 --> 41:00.480
you're gonna meet some really shitty people along the way.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.920
They're humans as well, so just ignore those.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.520
Fundraising is definitely not success.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.920
Fundraising is definitely not company building.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.680
You need to actually build your company.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.160
This is not the end, this is just the beginning.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.800
You may not be able to raise, so manage expectations,

41:15.800 --> 41:17.280
be ready for that, have a plan B.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.880
That's absolutely fine as well.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.280
As I said, very hard to fire investors,

41:21.280 --> 41:22.840
so watch out who you put in your cap table

41:22.840 --> 41:24.280
and who you marry.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.380
And another small point is that many investors

41:27.380 --> 41:30.080
only invest in certain locales,

41:30.080 --> 41:32.760
so like a lot of investors only invest in the US.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.060
That's something to keep in mind.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.760
Y Combinator, big fan.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.000
They fund a lot of open source startups.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.320
They've been transformational for us.

41:40.320 --> 41:41.960
I would really consider applying.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.320
We got rejected many times.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.200
Don't let it hold you back.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.200
There are a lot of great open source startups.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.680
GitLab, Docker, Superbase, Hopper,

41:48.680 --> 41:51.840
so really the list just goes on and on.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.080
So you're gonna be in good company.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.560
One thing is that you need to be aware of the siren song.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.200
So the tempting places where things

42:00.200 --> 42:01.840
usually go wrong for people.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.120
So one place is, as I said, fundraising,

42:04.120 --> 42:05.320
or valuation, or money raise,

42:05.320 --> 42:08.400
or thinking that talking to an investor is actually success.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.000
But again, no, you need to build your company.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.020
And another area that people go wrong

42:13.020 --> 42:15.060
is that thinking that hiring more people

42:15.060 --> 42:15.900
is actually success.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.080
So like, oh, I'm managing 20 people.

42:17.080 --> 42:17.920
How big is your team?

42:17.920 --> 42:19.240
I ask me that all the time.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.660
And we're small.

42:20.660 --> 42:22.280
And the reason why we're small is because

42:22.280 --> 42:23.980
that's what we need to build a kick ass product.

42:23.980 --> 42:25.760
And this is something that you need to keep in mind.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.520
Like burning money does not equate success.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.800
And plain startup does not mean building a company.

42:30.800 --> 42:33.040
So going to pitch competition, startup conferences,

42:33.040 --> 42:36.640
startup meetups, investor chats, all of those kind of things.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.460
Fun, chasing press as well.

42:38.460 --> 42:39.300
Maybe fun.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.000
Honestly, probably fun.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.820
But it really just don't mean anything

42:43.820 --> 42:44.840
for the bottom line of your business.

42:44.840 --> 42:46.200
So just don't do it.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.800
And also remember, you really have not made it.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.960
So really don't do it focused.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.080
The only things that matters are customers,

42:52.080 --> 42:54.220
product, team, and metrics.

42:54.220 --> 42:55.060
That's it.

42:55.060 --> 42:57.640
Everything else is just noise or maybe an enable

42:57.640 --> 42:59.480
to get to everything else.

43:00.560 --> 43:03.640
So some lessons I personally learned the hard way

43:04.640 --> 43:06.680
is that you're no longer an engineer.

43:06.680 --> 43:07.960
I really like coding.

43:07.960 --> 43:08.800
That's it.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.200
I wake up, I love coding.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.320
And it's really hard to remember

43:12.320 --> 43:14.000
that this is not why you raise capital.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.280
Like this is not what my job is at the business anymore.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.360
I'm the CEO.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.720
I need to do just business stuff.

43:19.720 --> 43:20.900
I mean, I can help with the code.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.200
I can help with the architecture.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.300
But my main time should be spent on Go to Market.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.660
Opportunities are not gonna last forever.

43:29.660 --> 43:30.940
So just grab them when you see them.

43:30.940 --> 43:31.780
It's very easy to say,

43:31.780 --> 43:33.920
oh, I'm just gonna perfect this landing page

43:33.920 --> 43:34.800
for a couple of more weeks

43:34.800 --> 43:37.100
and then I'm gonna take this opportunity.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.360
But then the opportunity is gonna be gone.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.560
And we missed a few in the beginning.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.360
And people are gonna be trying to take advantage of you.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.440
So just watch out.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.960
You're running a large budget.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.680
So just watch out for those people.

43:51.580 --> 43:54.800
Be mindful and protective of your time.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.760
So a lot of people are gonna wanna chat,

43:56.760 --> 43:58.180
catch up, whatever, great.

43:58.180 --> 44:01.040
But as I said, you're gonna be working 24 hours.

44:01.040 --> 44:04.000
So maybe spare the 25th hour for some fun stuff

44:04.000 --> 44:05.700
or maybe more work.

44:07.040 --> 44:07.880
And the last thing is that

44:07.880 --> 44:10.200
you really wanna surround yourself with optimists.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.400
The truth is that your startup sucks

44:12.400 --> 44:14.460
and it's gonna suck for the longest time.

44:14.460 --> 44:15.860
So the last thing you want is people

44:15.860 --> 44:17.400
that are negative around you.

44:18.920 --> 44:19.880
A few more things.

44:19.880 --> 44:21.520
Team, super important.

44:21.520 --> 44:22.520
Early team sets the tone.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.840
Bad hires can really derail the company.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.560
Great co-founders can make the difference.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.040
I've seen it multiple times.

44:28.040 --> 44:29.880
But actually better to start on your own

44:29.880 --> 44:33.000
than having a terrible co-founder, which I've also had.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.440
And you're really in control of your destiny.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.760
If something isn't working, you can change it.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.600
The only thing you cannot change is the market.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.640
But really just iterate, iterate, iterate.

44:42.640 --> 44:43.480
You can get lucky.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.660
We got lucky many times.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.120
Just put yourself out there, talk to customers,

44:47.120 --> 44:48.800
and you're gonna notice something that no one else has

44:48.800 --> 44:50.140
and you're gonna get lucky.

44:50.140 --> 44:51.720
And it's really a game of persistence.

44:51.720 --> 44:53.360
You can't lose unless you stop.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.880
Obviously I'm not saying go and bang your hand

44:54.880 --> 44:55.720
against the wall.

44:55.720 --> 44:58.320
You have to have some acumen there.

44:59.560 --> 45:02.920
But as long as you don't give up, you're gonna win.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.840
So just a few closing advice.

45:04.840 --> 45:08.040
It's very easy to think that hiring X will fix everything

45:08.040 --> 45:10.200
or customer X once we get them.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.040
That's it.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.680
The business is gonna go crazy.

45:12.680 --> 45:14.240
Or maybe this investor is gonna change

45:14.240 --> 45:15.320
the destiny of the company.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.320
And maybe, maybe some of them will.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.880
But it's really just on to you to actually fix the company

45:19.880 --> 45:20.880
and make it work.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.640
And you have to remember everything is sales.

45:23.640 --> 45:24.920
You have to really get good at it.

45:24.920 --> 45:25.760
You wanna get customers.

45:25.760 --> 45:26.640
You're gonna get candidates.

45:26.640 --> 45:27.680
You're gonna get investors.

45:27.680 --> 45:29.240
You have to sell them on the vision of the company

45:29.240 --> 45:30.440
and the company itself.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.040
Some more sources of great advice.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.680
NYC YouTube channel, library.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.320
I mean, check it out afterwards in the slides.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.400
And yeah, and that's it.

45:40.400 --> 45:42.360
I just wanna give you like a few closing words

45:42.360 --> 45:45.320
before I open the floor for questions.

45:45.320 --> 45:48.360
So make sure that it's really what you want.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.760
I mean, I've kind of like tried to dissuade you

45:50.760 --> 45:52.200
a bit in the beginning because really,

45:52.200 --> 45:54.400
you need to want to start this company

45:54.400 --> 45:56.320
even with my dissuasion there.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.440
And the only important things are to talk to your customers

45:59.440 --> 46:00.280
and build a product.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.600
Nothing else matters at this stage.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.760
You wanna build something that people love.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.360
You have to remember it's a business.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.560
It's not an open source project.

46:08.560 --> 46:10.840
It's something that you have to actually make money.

46:10.840 --> 46:14.360
And this is the primer, but there's so much more to it.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.200
And this is just to get you from zero to one.

46:16.200 --> 46:17.640
Every stage of the company is different

46:17.640 --> 46:19.160
and there's so much more.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.440
And maybe conflicting advice once you get to the one

46:21.440 --> 46:23.120
and once you get to the two.

46:23.120 --> 46:26.000
And one more thing.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.120
It's your job to be the number one evangelist of the company.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.720
And so always be selling.

46:30.720 --> 46:33.240
And in that spirit, if you need web hooks

46:33.240 --> 46:36.520
or you wanna work at a fast growing startup, yeah.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.720
Come talk to me about Svex.

46:38.720 --> 46:39.560
And that's it.

46:39.560 --> 46:40.400
Any questions?

46:40.400 --> 46:41.240
No.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.080
No.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.680
No.

46:43.680 --> 46:44.520
Bye.

46:44.520 --> 46:45.760
No, no.

46:45.760 --> 46:46.600
Yeah, sorry.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.440
A bit over.

46:47.440 --> 46:48.880
Amazing talk.

46:48.880 --> 47:05.320
Thanks a lot.
