1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.200
So welcome to my talk, clear skies, no clouds inside, running a business on free and open

2
0:00:11.200 --> 0:00:12.200
source software.

3
0:00:12.200 --> 0:00:14.920
A little bit about myself.

4
0:00:14.920 --> 0:00:19.640
My name is Hein-Peter van Brin, but if you talk to me, please call me HP.

5
0:00:19.640 --> 0:00:23.960
My mom does, and it feels much more at home.

6
0:00:23.960 --> 0:00:29.960
I'm a co-founder of two Godot related companies, Prehensile Tales, BV, which is a Godot consultant.

7
0:00:29.960 --> 0:00:38.040
Recently, Ramitaking corporate, which is a company that plans to improve the Godot mobile

8
0:00:38.040 --> 0:00:39.040
experience.

9
0:00:39.040 --> 0:00:43.000
Always be selling, I just heard.

10
0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:46.800
I'm also treasurer of the Godot Foundation, a gigantic nerd.

11
0:00:46.800 --> 0:00:54.040
I started a free and open source hosting site called notabuck.org around the time when,

12
0:00:54.040 --> 0:00:56.040
what was that?

13
0:00:56.040 --> 0:01:03.800
A gatorious shutdown, I think, and my personal blog is at blog.tm.cx.

14
0:01:03.800 --> 0:01:06.000
So what is this presentation about?

15
0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:10.360
First of all, can you run a business entirely on free and open source software?

16
0:01:10.360 --> 0:01:13.400
Should you run a business entirely on a free and open source software?

17
0:01:13.400 --> 0:01:14.400
Are you mad?

18
0:01:14.400 --> 0:01:16.480
And by that I mean me.

19
0:01:16.480 --> 0:01:17.480
Maybe some of you too.

20
0:01:17.480 --> 0:01:18.480
I don't know.

21
0:01:18.480 --> 0:01:24.360
What does it mean to do this and how can you actually do this?

22
0:01:24.360 --> 0:01:26.480
What this presentation isn't about.

23
0:01:26.480 --> 0:01:31.080
It isn't a total lesson on managing a large fleet of servers.

24
0:01:31.080 --> 0:01:32.440
There's other talks about that.

25
0:01:32.440 --> 0:01:37.540
There's other people specializing in running data centers with thousands of servers.

26
0:01:37.540 --> 0:01:38.620
This is not this.

27
0:01:38.620 --> 0:01:44.760
This is for a reasonable amount of people and a reasonable amount of servers.

28
0:01:44.760 --> 0:01:49.600
It's also not a lesson in starting a flame war about configuration management systems.

29
0:01:49.600 --> 0:01:53.040
So please don't at me if I say something you don't like.

30
0:01:53.040 --> 0:02:01.520
I am going to say some things you don't like if you are a sysadmin for a much larger organization.

31
0:02:01.520 --> 0:02:03.960
So first of all, can you do this?

32
0:02:03.960 --> 0:02:09.680
Well, I've polled all the speakers on this stage and 100% of them say yes.

33
0:02:09.680 --> 0:02:13.240
So that's a good start, I think.

34
0:02:13.240 --> 0:02:15.640
So why would you do this?

35
0:02:15.640 --> 0:02:18.520
That's I think a question that a lot of people might ask themselves.

36
0:02:18.520 --> 0:02:20.320
I mean, we're all here at FOSDEM.

37
0:02:20.320 --> 0:02:25.240
We're here so I don't have to talk to you about the benefits of open source software,

38
0:02:25.240 --> 0:02:28.200
why you should use free software, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

39
0:02:28.200 --> 0:02:31.120
That's not what I'm here for.

40
0:02:31.120 --> 0:02:38.000
So first of all, while you can use free tier of cloud services for almost everything, you

41
0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:40.160
can get most of the features.

42
0:02:40.160 --> 0:02:44.720
Once you start to get to a certain size, even if you're only as a small company, you end

43
0:02:44.720 --> 0:02:51.600
up with five, six, seven accounts for individual users.

44
0:02:51.600 --> 0:02:59.360
And it is very difficult for people to figure out what password to use.

45
0:02:59.360 --> 0:03:04.080
So you either end up with people using very insecure passwords, so you end up having to

46
0:03:04.080 --> 0:03:10.600
force a password policy on them, and then they're just going to write it down or whatever.

47
0:03:10.600 --> 0:03:15.640
And someone still has to fix these issues if they happen in your company.

48
0:03:15.640 --> 0:03:20.400
Now you are a certain suddenly help desk for people forgetting their passwords.

49
0:03:20.400 --> 0:03:23.680
At least that's been my experience.

50
0:03:23.680 --> 0:03:27.440
So access control is actually the real big one.

51
0:03:27.440 --> 0:03:33.960
Once you start to mix a bunch of different cloud services on basic tiers or free tiers,

52
0:03:33.960 --> 0:03:40.560
figuring out who has access to what, if everyone has the access that they need, and most importantly,

53
0:03:40.560 --> 0:03:43.400
new people have more access than they need.

54
0:03:43.400 --> 0:03:47.720
It is very difficult to keep track of which document was shared with whom, why was it

55
0:03:47.720 --> 0:03:48.720
shared with that person.

56
0:03:48.720 --> 0:03:51.560
Is it an individual that shared it with another individual?

57
0:03:51.560 --> 0:03:57.000
Is it someone that maybe left the company now but they shared it with their public or

58
0:03:57.000 --> 0:03:59.720
private Google accounts, et cetera.

59
0:03:59.720 --> 0:04:02.480
It's very difficult to keep track of these things.

60
0:04:02.480 --> 0:04:09.640
This could be a problem if you sign non-disclosure agreements with customers, other people that

61
0:04:09.640 --> 0:04:11.280
you work with.

62
0:04:11.280 --> 0:04:16.080
And depending on the business that you actually run, it could be a compliance issue, particularly

63
0:04:16.080 --> 0:04:19.480
now with GDPR, et cetera.

64
0:04:19.480 --> 0:04:23.960
There's a lot of things you have to keep track of.

65
0:04:23.960 --> 0:04:28.280
Of course, I see some of you think, but you can already do this.

66
0:04:28.280 --> 0:04:30.640
In fact, my company already does this.

67
0:04:30.640 --> 0:04:35.520
Yes, it is certainly possible.

68
0:04:35.520 --> 0:04:40.960
But usually, if you want these level of features and these level of integrations, you end up

69
0:04:40.960 --> 0:04:48.240
having to pay actually quite a bit of money for individuals and only to get this fairly

70
0:04:48.240 --> 0:04:53.440
basic level of control over your data.

71
0:04:53.440 --> 0:04:58.200
It also does work if you say, okay, I'm going to pick one SaaS provider.

72
0:04:58.200 --> 0:05:03.160
If you say, okay, I'm going to use only Google products, I'm not going to use anything outside

73
0:05:03.160 --> 0:05:04.160
of Google products.

74
0:05:04.160 --> 0:05:06.400
If Google doesn't have it, I'm not going to use it.

75
0:05:06.400 --> 0:05:09.880
That of course also works.

76
0:05:09.880 --> 0:05:12.720
So is this all about money?

77
0:05:12.720 --> 0:05:15.280
But not really.

78
0:05:15.280 --> 0:05:17.800
I will get to that in a minute.

79
0:05:17.800 --> 0:05:25.860
But the first thing I usually hear from anyone who talks about doing something like this

80
0:05:25.860 --> 0:05:33.040
is either a knee-jerk reaction, as in, but it's actually more expensive to do it yourself.

81
0:05:33.040 --> 0:05:34.560
I don't think that is true.

82
0:05:34.560 --> 0:05:37.480
At least it's not true for me.

83
0:05:37.480 --> 0:05:43.040
So at least it means it's not a truthism that definitely applies to all cases.

84
0:05:43.040 --> 0:05:48.000
Or of course, the other one, it's only free if your time is free.

85
0:05:48.000 --> 0:05:50.080
That is also fair.

86
0:05:50.080 --> 0:05:55.480
But having tried this in a different way, supporting individual people in a bunch of

87
0:05:55.480 --> 0:06:01.440
different time zones in the case of my companies with, oh, I don't have access to this document.

88
0:06:01.440 --> 0:06:03.320
Can you send it to me?

89
0:06:03.320 --> 0:06:11.440
Or I have people working in North America who share a document or fail to do it correctly,

90
0:06:11.440 --> 0:06:15.000
and a person working in Poland needs it the next day.

91
0:06:15.000 --> 0:06:19.920
Due to the time zone difference, they won't get that document until 5 p.m. because nobody

92
0:06:19.920 --> 0:06:24.580
but the person who created it had access to it.

93
0:06:24.580 --> 0:06:27.600
This is also a time sink.

94
0:06:27.600 --> 0:06:35.680
And of course, if the worst came to worst, failing in a compliance case is probably not

95
0:06:35.680 --> 0:06:38.920
going to be free either.

96
0:06:38.920 --> 0:06:43.200
So what is this about, then, if it's not just about money?

97
0:06:43.200 --> 0:06:46.480
First of all, I just like being in control of my data.

98
0:06:46.480 --> 0:06:48.560
I like to know where my data is.

99
0:06:48.560 --> 0:06:50.160
I like to know where it's backed up.

100
0:06:50.160 --> 0:06:55.340
And I like to know that if I need to, I can just stick it on an external USB drive and

101
0:06:55.340 --> 0:06:57.360
take it with me somewhere.

102
0:06:57.360 --> 0:07:00.680
And you just want to hack your data.

103
0:07:00.680 --> 0:07:03.840
I like having unsurprising costs.

104
0:07:03.840 --> 0:07:07.720
I know exactly how much my infrastructure is going to cost this month.

105
0:07:07.720 --> 0:07:10.240
I know how much it's going to cost next month.

106
0:07:10.240 --> 0:07:15.280
If I need to, for a new project, whatever, add five external people to give access to

107
0:07:15.280 --> 0:07:22.400
some shared resources, I know I'm not going to end up paying 150, 200 euros more next

108
0:07:22.400 --> 0:07:23.400
month.

109
0:07:23.400 --> 0:07:30.120
And I do forget to not cancel again because I end up keeping paying it.

110
0:07:30.120 --> 0:07:35.680
It gives me a big peace of mind when it comes to access control, what I just talked about.

111
0:07:35.680 --> 0:07:40.440
I know exactly which one of my users have access to what data.

112
0:07:40.440 --> 0:07:44.960
I know why they have access to it because it's based on group memberships.

113
0:07:44.960 --> 0:07:50.600
And I know, luckily, this has not happened, but I also know if something were to go really

114
0:07:50.600 --> 0:07:56.760
wrong, I can, in fact, make sure that people stop having access to the data that I don't

115
0:07:56.760 --> 0:07:59.760
want them to have access to anymore.

116
0:07:59.760 --> 0:08:05.920
By giving people access to just one user ID and one password and one way of logging in,

117
0:08:05.920 --> 0:08:09.440
I feel like I'm making their day just a little bit better.

118
0:08:09.440 --> 0:08:12.800
And that makes me happy.

119
0:08:12.800 --> 0:08:16.200
Just using free and open source software is nice.

120
0:08:16.200 --> 0:08:21.000
I mean, most of the people here are here for a reason as well, so I'm assuming that most

121
0:08:21.000 --> 0:08:23.280
of you agree with that.

122
0:08:23.280 --> 0:08:28.160
If I run a laptop with just free software because it's important to me, why would I

123
0:08:28.160 --> 0:08:31.800
run my business on anything else?

124
0:08:31.800 --> 0:08:38.280
And it feels very good to be part of a community rather than just a customer.

125
0:08:38.280 --> 0:08:43.240
I do pay for certain software.

126
0:08:43.240 --> 0:08:47.160
Let's get into that later, sorry.

127
0:08:47.160 --> 0:08:53.400
But even there, you end up not really being treated so much as a small customer.

128
0:08:53.400 --> 0:08:59.200
You tend to be treated more like a community member to a certain extent.

129
0:08:59.200 --> 0:09:04.760
Also they appreciate good bucket reports more, which is always nice.

130
0:09:04.760 --> 0:09:07.600
But isn't this like super duper hard?

131
0:09:07.600 --> 0:09:12.280
I don't think so.

132
0:09:12.280 --> 0:09:16.760
It is true that you need some things, need to know some things that you might not need

133
0:09:16.760 --> 0:09:21.120
to know otherwise, particularly not if, say, you go in all in on Google Workspace or you

134
0:09:21.120 --> 0:09:25.320
go in all in on Office 365.

135
0:09:25.320 --> 0:09:29.880
You don't need to know a whole lot about infrastructure at all.

136
0:09:29.880 --> 0:09:30.880
For this you do.

137
0:09:30.880 --> 0:09:32.120
I'm not going to lie about that.

138
0:09:32.120 --> 0:09:36.760
The most important thing is actually DNS, tying all of that together, making sure that

139
0:09:36.760 --> 0:09:40.600
your emails don't end up in people's spam folders, et cetera.

140
0:09:40.600 --> 0:09:43.640
Most of this actually boils down to a basic knowledge of DNS.

141
0:09:43.640 --> 0:09:49.080
You're going to need to know a little bit about how to run a web server, how to administer

142
0:09:49.080 --> 0:09:54.160
a web server and what web servers do, but not as much as you might think.

143
0:09:54.160 --> 0:09:56.760
And of course a basic understanding of the Linux CLI.

144
0:09:56.760 --> 0:10:00.880
Or I guess the FreeBSD CLI, if that's what you decide to do.

145
0:10:00.880 --> 0:10:04.880
But it's a similar thing.

146
0:10:04.880 --> 0:10:11.760
So most people when I talk about this have a perception that building something like

147
0:10:11.760 --> 0:10:15.920
this ends up with a cognitive overhead that looks something like this.

148
0:10:15.920 --> 0:10:20.800
It's an extremely complicated set of tools where every individual thing that fails could

149
0:10:20.800 --> 0:10:23.640
break everything.

150
0:10:23.640 --> 0:10:27.000
But in reality it's really not that bad.

151
0:10:27.000 --> 0:10:32.560
You end up with a bunch of containers running on one or more hosts with a simple set of

152
0:10:32.560 --> 0:10:36.880
configuration files that you stuff into Git and that's basically it.

153
0:10:36.880 --> 0:10:42.720
You don't manage 15 things, you manage six things or seven things.

154
0:10:42.720 --> 0:10:44.840
All right.

155
0:10:44.840 --> 0:10:47.320
So how do you do this kind of thing?

156
0:10:47.320 --> 0:10:52.240
Well, the most important thing really is to keep things simple.

157
0:10:52.240 --> 0:10:56.880
As soon as you start looking online about managing Linux servers, et cetera, you end

158
0:10:56.880 --> 0:10:59.640
up finding a whole pile of wonderful tools.

159
0:10:59.640 --> 0:11:02.840
I'm not trying to tell you that you should not use these tools, by the way.

160
0:11:02.840 --> 0:11:07.800
I'm just telling you that in this case if you're just managing two or three servers,

161
0:11:07.800 --> 0:11:12.000
some of these tools might not be what you need.

162
0:11:12.000 --> 0:11:15.960
And trust upstream.

163
0:11:15.960 --> 0:11:19.760
When you use a cloud provider you're just trusting that your cloud provider does the

164
0:11:19.760 --> 0:11:23.440
right thing at any given time.

165
0:11:23.440 --> 0:11:28.580
If you use a piece of open source software, if you use an open source operating system,

166
0:11:28.580 --> 0:11:36.600
if you use an open source NGINX or other web server, trust that upstream tests the stuff

167
0:11:36.600 --> 0:11:38.240
they do.

168
0:11:38.240 --> 0:11:46.520
You don't need a five street test environment just to install a security update on your

169
0:11:46.520 --> 0:11:50.200
operating system.

170
0:11:50.200 --> 0:11:52.920
So how do you keep things simple?

171
0:11:52.920 --> 0:12:01.240
As I said, there's a lot of really great tools like puppet chef, and probably a bunch that

172
0:12:01.240 --> 0:12:02.240
I forgot.

173
0:12:02.240 --> 0:12:05.800
I think there might even be some in this floor that I forgot to include in this.

174
0:12:05.800 --> 0:12:11.200
My apologies if that's one of your projects.

175
0:12:11.200 --> 0:12:13.800
These tools truly are great.

176
0:12:13.800 --> 0:12:18.940
I have been a sysadmin at a large company and without tools like this I would have absolutely

177
0:12:18.940 --> 0:12:20.840
lost my mind.

178
0:12:20.840 --> 0:12:29.360
However, setting up services using these tools is a lot of translating between documentation

179
0:12:29.360 --> 0:12:36.160
you read about the tool into a configuration file format that isn't the one that is documented

180
0:12:36.160 --> 0:12:39.120
on the side of the thing you're trying to configure.

181
0:12:39.120 --> 0:12:47.920
And there's a lot of testing involved, which is great if you need to repeat this on 100

182
0:12:47.920 --> 0:12:53.520
servers, but if it's one box you need to do and that you maybe need to redo in a year,

183
0:12:53.520 --> 0:12:56.360
it's a lot of cognitive overhead.

184
0:12:56.360 --> 0:13:02.340
And if your business grows to the point where this becomes necessary, then probably the

185
0:13:02.340 --> 0:13:08.080
overhead of converting what you did now into a puppet manifest, Ansible or whatever, is

186
0:13:08.080 --> 0:13:14.520
probably not the thing that's going to prevent you from growing.

187
0:13:14.520 --> 0:13:18.840
In that same vein, as soon as you start to look at how do I run containers, how do I

188
0:13:18.840 --> 0:13:20.400
do that myself?

189
0:13:20.400 --> 0:13:25.560
Again, lots of great resources, lots of super great projects.

190
0:13:25.560 --> 0:13:33.280
But if you search on Google, how do I run a server with containers, one of the first

191
0:13:33.280 --> 0:13:36.920
links you're going to find is you're going to get to set up a Kubernetes, you're going

192
0:13:36.920 --> 0:13:47.280
to create an under cloud and an over cloud and you're going to set up redundant, I don't

193
0:13:47.280 --> 0:13:49.400
know, load balancers.

194
0:13:49.400 --> 0:13:51.960
That was the word I was looking for.

195
0:13:51.960 --> 0:13:55.640
And you're going to set all of this great stuff up and at some point when you have a

196
0:13:55.640 --> 0:13:59.480
thousand servers it's just going to be just as easy as if you had a hundred.

197
0:13:59.480 --> 0:14:04.560
Yeah, and I can understand why if you start reading that you get incredibly overwhelmed

198
0:14:04.560 --> 0:14:07.280
immediately because that is a lot of stuff to learn.

199
0:14:07.280 --> 0:14:11.760
And again, you're not going to need it for what we're talking about here.

200
0:14:11.760 --> 0:14:14.720
Again, I think all of these projects are great.

201
0:14:14.720 --> 0:14:17.720
I have used many of them.

202
0:14:17.720 --> 0:14:19.480
This is just not about that.

203
0:14:19.480 --> 0:14:21.600
Please don't add me.

204
0:14:21.600 --> 0:14:25.960
So what does it mean to use simple software?

205
0:14:25.960 --> 0:14:30.040
So in this case, use what is supplied by the OS that you use.

206
0:14:30.040 --> 0:14:34.800
Every piece of software you install that is not in the repositories of the operating system

207
0:14:34.800 --> 0:14:38.480
you use, that is something that you might regret later because that is something that

208
0:14:38.480 --> 0:14:42.960
is not tested by your upstream.

209
0:14:42.960 --> 0:14:46.280
This is again where we come to the trusting upstream part of things.

210
0:14:46.280 --> 0:14:48.720
So in this case, we're going to get there.

211
0:14:48.720 --> 0:14:51.480
I'm using Fedora for most of this stuff.

212
0:14:51.480 --> 0:14:56.480
Use Potman or Docker, use systemd, not whatever else might, a nice thing you might come up

213
0:14:56.480 --> 0:14:57.480
with.

214
0:14:57.480 --> 0:15:00.360
And in this case, you are not going to need to do anything too creative.

215
0:15:00.360 --> 0:15:03.960
Use Git for your configuration management.

216
0:15:03.960 --> 0:15:08.080
This is probably the most controversial point of this presentation.

217
0:15:08.080 --> 0:15:09.640
Use a recent OS.

218
0:15:09.640 --> 0:15:12.000
You do not need CentOS.

219
0:15:12.000 --> 0:15:13.600
You do not need Alma Linux.

220
0:15:13.600 --> 0:15:16.160
You do not need Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

221
0:15:16.160 --> 0:15:22.520
You need something where if you read a documentation that it is the last thing that people actually

222
0:15:22.520 --> 0:15:24.760
touched.

223
0:15:24.760 --> 0:15:31.240
People are not writing documentation, generally speaking, on how to set up a modern thing

224
0:15:31.240 --> 0:15:36.960
on an ancient enterprise distribution.

225
0:15:36.960 --> 0:15:39.120
Again, these things have their places.

226
0:15:39.120 --> 0:15:40.120
I'm not telling anyone.

227
0:15:40.120 --> 0:15:42.360
I'm not trying to tell anyone that these things are bad.

228
0:15:42.360 --> 0:15:46.520
Again, this is about you managing your time and making sure you don't spend a lot of time

229
0:15:46.520 --> 0:15:49.040
doing this.

230
0:15:49.040 --> 0:15:53.200
And upgrading your server every 12 to 18 months really isn't a big deal.

231
0:15:53.200 --> 0:15:55.160
Again, trust upstream.

232
0:15:55.160 --> 0:16:00.080
The enough system upgrade released for the next one 20 minutes later, you have your operating

233
0:16:00.080 --> 0:16:01.240
system upgraded.

234
0:16:01.240 --> 0:16:04.240
It's not a big deal.

235
0:16:04.240 --> 0:16:08.400
Another thing, use preexisting containers wherever possible.

236
0:16:08.400 --> 0:16:10.080
You can, of course, write your own.

237
0:16:10.080 --> 0:16:13.120
Sometimes you will have to for the demo I'm about to give.

238
0:16:13.120 --> 0:16:17.680
I did have to write one.

239
0:16:17.680 --> 0:16:22.120
And don't forget that upstream tends to prefer using their containers over a different way

240
0:16:22.120 --> 0:16:24.920
of deploying their software.

241
0:16:24.920 --> 0:16:29.280
So generally speaking, if you have an issue and you say, okay, I'm running your latest

242
0:16:29.280 --> 0:16:34.600
container version, you're actually more likely to get help than if you installed in any other

243
0:16:34.600 --> 0:16:35.600
way.

244
0:16:35.600 --> 0:16:40.840
Of course, what do we do about backup and disaster recovery?

245
0:16:40.840 --> 0:16:45.360
Well, if you follow the recipe that I'm going to talk about, then basically you have two

246
0:16:45.360 --> 0:16:48.160
directories to backup on each server.

247
0:16:48.160 --> 0:16:52.040
And if something goes wrong, you have two directories to replace back on the server.

248
0:16:52.040 --> 0:16:54.960
And basically your stuff is back.

249
0:16:54.960 --> 0:17:00.120
I will hear the people managing infrastructures for a large corporation saying, but this will

250
0:17:00.120 --> 0:17:01.120
take hours.

251
0:17:01.120 --> 0:17:02.120
Yes.

252
0:17:02.120 --> 0:17:05.160
It also almost never happens.

253
0:17:05.160 --> 0:17:13.880
And this way you can be sure that your data is not gone if something goes wrong without

254
0:17:13.880 --> 0:17:19.920
breaking the bank.

255
0:17:19.920 --> 0:17:24.080
Basically speaking, I've been doing this for quite a while now.

256
0:17:24.080 --> 0:17:27.280
And I've had one server fail due to a hard disk failure.

257
0:17:27.280 --> 0:17:32.880
Of course, the server was just using a rate one mirror.

258
0:17:32.880 --> 0:17:37.280
So I just called the people who run the data center.

259
0:17:37.280 --> 0:17:38.320
They replaced the disk.

260
0:17:38.320 --> 0:17:41.760
And there was actually not really a problem there.

261
0:17:41.760 --> 0:17:47.760
I would like to now introduce megacorp.icu.

262
0:17:47.760 --> 0:17:54.840
This is a very big company that has graciously let me demo their environment.

263
0:17:54.840 --> 0:17:57.120
Completely non-evil.

264
0:17:57.120 --> 0:18:03.400
They let me show you their environment because prehencetiles, my own company, the CEO, thought

265
0:18:03.400 --> 0:18:10.520
it was irresponsible to have the internal systems recorded on iFree and open source.

266
0:18:10.520 --> 0:18:12.560
And a developers European meeting thing.

267
0:18:12.560 --> 0:18:15.480
I don't know what they're thinking.

268
0:18:15.480 --> 0:18:21.720
Because nine totally real employees that were absolutely not AI generated.

269
0:18:21.720 --> 0:18:27.640
The thing I'm about to show you is a setup that is roughly looks like this.

270
0:18:27.640 --> 0:18:33.880
There are three hosts running on this laptop, hopefully.

271
0:18:33.880 --> 0:18:34.880
Configured as such.

272
0:18:34.880 --> 0:18:40.600
So we have three hosts with an overlay network on WireGuard to make sure that these hosts

273
0:18:40.600 --> 0:18:44.360
can talk to each other over local IP addresses.

274
0:18:44.360 --> 0:18:49.880
Even for that being, when you do something like this, you're probably not going to be

275
0:18:49.880 --> 0:18:55.640
able to afford or want to pay for dedicated workspace where your server is nicely lined

276
0:18:55.640 --> 0:19:00.680
up above each other, connected to each other over local connections.

277
0:19:00.680 --> 0:19:04.720
So you need some way for the servers to feel like a LAN.

278
0:19:04.720 --> 0:19:10.320
By doing a simple WireGuard mesh, any one server can go down and the other two can still

279
0:19:10.320 --> 0:19:14.280
talk to each other, which is a nice feature to have.

280
0:19:14.280 --> 0:19:18.640
So and now a hopefully non colossal mistake.

281
0:19:18.640 --> 0:19:31.360
I'm going to try to actually show you what this looks like by using a system like this.

282
0:19:31.360 --> 0:19:40.800
So first of all, this is the basic basically admin interface you might see if you're using

283
0:19:40.800 --> 0:19:42.720
something like this.

284
0:19:42.720 --> 0:19:48.960
So we have our nine users here in LDAP.

285
0:19:48.960 --> 0:19:52.200
And we have a couple of groups here that you can manage.

286
0:19:52.200 --> 0:19:59.000
So I've made a human resources team for which Chatwick and Maxwell are our members.

287
0:19:59.000 --> 0:20:05.760
I made some shared mailboxes that human resources team can also look at.

288
0:20:05.760 --> 0:20:18.200
And so what this looks like here is for instance, let's see, I have a new container tab.

289
0:20:18.200 --> 0:20:21.680
This one I think.

290
0:20:21.680 --> 0:20:28.800
So to show for a little explanation, I'm using a feature of Firefox here called container

291
0:20:28.800 --> 0:20:30.600
tabs.

292
0:20:30.600 --> 0:20:35.080
Basically in the top right here you will see the name of one of the fake users.

293
0:20:35.080 --> 0:20:39.000
I mean totally real users.

294
0:20:39.000 --> 0:20:44.360
And basically Firefox will keep all the cookies, et cetera, separated so I can show you what

295
0:20:44.360 --> 0:20:47.160
it means to log in from multiple systems.

296
0:20:47.160 --> 0:20:52.920
Just a private tab would only give me two Firefox tab containers because it basically

297
0:20:52.920 --> 0:20:58.080
gives you an unlimited number of private tabs essentially.

298
0:20:58.080 --> 0:20:59.920
So that's what we're doing here.

299
0:20:59.920 --> 0:21:02.600
So the first thing we can do is this is the wrong one.

300
0:21:02.600 --> 0:21:06.200
This is the real one of my real company.

301
0:21:06.200 --> 0:21:08.600
Didn't I?

302
0:21:08.600 --> 0:21:12.120
I thought so.

303
0:21:12.120 --> 0:21:16.680
I was smart enough to actually make bookmarks and then I didn't use them.

304
0:21:16.680 --> 0:21:22.800
So the user name of this person is CadenceR.

305
0:21:22.800 --> 0:21:27.560
So first of all, this is basically the login screen that every user will see.

306
0:21:27.560 --> 0:21:29.000
Hopefully only once a day.

307
0:21:29.000 --> 0:21:35.880
The way this works is you log into the system, there is a cookie that gets set for key cloak

308
0:21:35.880 --> 0:21:41.680
in this case and key cloak then does all the authentication with further back ends.

309
0:21:41.680 --> 0:21:46.160
So generally speaking, if everything works properly, your users will only have to log

310
0:21:46.160 --> 0:21:51.720
in once a day, also meaning that your password policies and things like that can be a little

311
0:21:51.720 --> 0:21:55.160
bit stricter because they really only have to remember one and they really only have

312
0:21:55.160 --> 0:22:01.080
to type it in once a day.

313
0:22:01.080 --> 0:22:03.960
So oh yes, this user actually doesn't have access to this.

314
0:22:03.960 --> 0:22:09.160
That was part of the demo, but I forgot that in this case.

315
0:22:09.160 --> 0:22:11.640
We will get there.

316
0:22:11.640 --> 0:22:15.780
Let me show you something that the user does have access to, their email box.

317
0:22:15.780 --> 0:22:24.400
So you see that I just switched from the next cloud to the email server and you also noticed

318
0:22:24.400 --> 0:22:28.680
hopefully that there was not another login prompt.

319
0:22:28.680 --> 0:22:35.040
That is again because these single sign on systems, if you deploy them properly, are

320
0:22:35.040 --> 0:22:36.360
in fact single sign on.

321
0:22:36.360 --> 0:22:39.920
You sign on once and then it should just keep working.

322
0:22:39.920 --> 0:22:43.040
So this is the email box for our user Cadence.

323
0:22:43.040 --> 0:22:49.960
We can see we have an address book with all of the people, all of her colleagues in it.

324
0:22:49.960 --> 0:22:56.760
And here is Chatwick Parsons.

325
0:22:56.760 --> 0:23:01.980
These names are also all AI generated by the way.

326
0:23:01.980 --> 0:23:05.840
So what we can do is we can send an email to Chatwick here.

327
0:23:05.840 --> 0:23:10.840
Let's see, am I doing the right thing?

328
0:23:10.840 --> 0:23:28.560
I can send a little email to Chatwick here.

329
0:23:28.560 --> 0:23:36.920
And now hopefully when we switch to the Chatwick, there we go, Chatwick there, sure it's now

330
0:23:36.920 --> 0:23:38.080
have received an email.

331
0:23:38.080 --> 0:23:46.440
And you see also that the things like small little things like the fact that all of the

332
0:23:46.440 --> 0:23:50.200
users have their own little profile pictures, et cetera.

333
0:23:50.200 --> 0:23:53.440
And these are all consistent across all the applications as well.

334
0:23:53.440 --> 0:24:01.560
So if you look at the Chatwicks, Chatwicks does have access to the next cloud.

335
0:24:01.560 --> 0:24:07.120
There we go.

336
0:24:07.120 --> 0:24:17.200
And you see that this actually shows the same.

337
0:24:17.200 --> 0:24:19.520
You click the same button twice, the same thing happens.

338
0:24:19.520 --> 0:24:20.520
This is very surprising.

339
0:24:20.520 --> 0:24:21.520
All right.

340
0:24:21.520 --> 0:24:25.920
And you see here that the user has this, oh, sorry.

341
0:24:25.920 --> 0:24:29.560
You see here that the user actually has the same profile picture as well.

342
0:24:29.560 --> 0:24:36.800
These profile pictures all came from Active Directory, thank God not.

343
0:24:36.800 --> 0:24:44.760
And from OpenLDAP as well.

344
0:24:44.760 --> 0:24:48.680
So what can you actually do with this?

345
0:24:48.680 --> 0:24:51.840
What is the big thing that I kept talking about?

346
0:24:51.840 --> 0:25:00.120
For instance, here we have a human resources folder that Chatwick has access to because

347
0:25:00.120 --> 0:25:04.400
Chatwick is part of the human resources department.

348
0:25:04.400 --> 0:25:10.880
And so is the guy.

349
0:25:10.880 --> 0:25:13.240
Maxwell is also an HR person.

350
0:25:13.240 --> 0:25:29.200
So Maxwell and Chatwick.

351
0:25:29.200 --> 0:25:31.600
So far everything is still working.

352
0:25:31.600 --> 0:25:34.880
Very good.

353
0:25:34.880 --> 0:25:41.040
You see that Maxwell here has access to the same document.

354
0:25:41.040 --> 0:25:42.960
And there's not been any like sharing here.

355
0:25:42.960 --> 0:25:45.360
It is just a matter of being part of the correct group.

356
0:25:45.360 --> 0:25:47.200
I will show that in a second.

357
0:25:47.200 --> 0:25:55.080
But if you look at the access that this is Alba Kelly.

358
0:25:55.080 --> 0:26:06.360
Thank you for getting this nice handy dandy.

359
0:26:06.360 --> 0:26:10.400
It's not exactly single sign on if you're doing a demo with five different users.

360
0:26:10.400 --> 0:26:13.640
It is only once per user, not once per demo.

361
0:26:13.640 --> 0:26:16.720
I'm afraid.

362
0:26:16.720 --> 0:26:24.960
You see here that the user Alba here does not have access to the shared directory and

363
0:26:24.960 --> 0:26:26.640
cannot see it.

364
0:26:26.640 --> 0:26:35.840
And trying to just send a link to this other person will also not work.

365
0:26:35.840 --> 0:26:40.240
As you see, you just get a found not found error.

366
0:26:40.240 --> 0:26:45.720
Now, what if Alba does become part of the human resources team?

367
0:26:45.720 --> 0:27:03.080
Well, at this point, it's just a matter of adding the member here.

368
0:27:03.080 --> 0:27:07.240
And then in a couple of minutes, hopefully, maybe immediately.

369
0:27:07.240 --> 0:27:08.240
No.

370
0:27:08.240 --> 0:27:10.960
We'll get back to that.

371
0:27:10.960 --> 0:27:12.360
All right.

372
0:27:12.360 --> 0:27:17.240
What's the next thing on my list of things to show?

373
0:27:17.240 --> 0:27:18.240
All right.

374
0:27:18.240 --> 0:27:24.560
I also created this user, Mary J. So what you've seen so far is basically what it looks

375
0:27:24.560 --> 0:27:29.440
like for people who have been working for a while who already know the system.

376
0:27:29.440 --> 0:27:33.200
So what does this look like for a completely new user?

377
0:27:33.200 --> 0:27:35.560
Because that's kind of like another problem, right?

378
0:27:35.560 --> 0:27:45.920
Being people signed up onboard in your organization.

379
0:27:45.920 --> 0:27:49.760
I keep forgetting I made these.

380
0:27:49.760 --> 0:27:53.560
So let's say you tell your new user, okay, the first thing you need to do is just go

381
0:27:53.560 --> 0:27:57.040
to the chat system to say hello.

382
0:27:57.040 --> 0:28:02.680
So we have given the user their initial temporary password.

383
0:28:02.680 --> 0:28:11.640
I sign in and you see that you get just this one little prompt for people to change the

384
0:28:11.640 --> 0:28:12.640
password.

385
0:28:12.640 --> 0:28:15.400
And after that, they're just signed up like everything else.

386
0:28:15.400 --> 0:28:19.460
So this is basically the only real onboarding that your users have to do.

387
0:28:19.460 --> 0:28:22.480
So they don't have to create accounts for multiple things.

388
0:28:22.480 --> 0:28:25.240
You don't have to create accounts for multiple things.

389
0:28:25.240 --> 0:28:31.720
They don't end up having to tie their personal Gmail accounts to some kind of Google Drive,

390
0:28:31.720 --> 0:28:36.160
nothing like that.

391
0:28:36.160 --> 0:28:39.640
And there we are.

392
0:28:39.640 --> 0:28:52.000
The same thing goes for things like the access to, for instance, channels on your instant

393
0:28:52.000 --> 0:28:53.000
messaging server.

394
0:28:53.000 --> 0:29:00.560
You see here that Chatwick being part of the human resources group has access to this channel

395
0:29:00.560 --> 0:29:08.080
HR that is not visible to this user, Maria Johnson.

396
0:29:08.080 --> 0:29:12.640
So Maria Johnson is not part of HR, does not see the group.

397
0:29:12.640 --> 0:29:15.520
This is not something that you have to manage yourself either.

398
0:29:15.520 --> 0:29:24.980
We also see here that since Elba was recently promoted to be part of the HR group, she now

399
0:29:24.980 --> 0:29:27.760
has access to the HR channel as well.

400
0:29:27.760 --> 0:29:34.040
Again, this speaks to this access control that I was talking about previously.

401
0:29:34.040 --> 0:29:41.640
You don't have to think about, okay, what things does an HR person have access to?

402
0:29:41.640 --> 0:29:43.160
Did I give them access to the right folders?

403
0:29:43.160 --> 0:29:46.040
Did I give them access to the right shared email address, et cetera?

404
0:29:46.040 --> 0:29:49.760
It's all just taking care.

405
0:29:49.760 --> 0:29:56.640
You only take care of this one time when you set this up, basically.

406
0:29:56.640 --> 0:30:05.760
So there's a couple of other things that people like to use, like editing documents together.

407
0:30:05.760 --> 0:30:22.600
We can do that if I probably should have kept more tabs open.

408
0:30:22.600 --> 0:30:27.880
It turns out navigating a computer is much easier when you're writing a talk and sitting

409
0:30:27.880 --> 0:30:31.880
down instead of facing a room of 700 people.

410
0:30:31.880 --> 0:30:38.840
Not 700 if you're here.

411
0:30:38.840 --> 0:30:44.400
So we have two people logged in here.

412
0:30:44.400 --> 0:30:56.680
And you'll be able to edit things collaboratively much like Google Docs, et cetera, as well.

413
0:30:56.680 --> 0:31:01.720
So you don't really need to lose any features over any of this either.

414
0:31:01.720 --> 0:31:04.600
Let's see.

415
0:31:04.600 --> 0:31:08.720
This is all done.

416
0:31:08.720 --> 0:31:15.200
We have the chance.

417
0:31:15.200 --> 0:31:16.200
Yes.

418
0:31:16.200 --> 0:31:27.400
So these are the services that I added to the demo for this demo.

419
0:31:27.400 --> 0:31:32.600
If anyone has any questions about what other things you could easily do, we have a question

420
0:31:32.600 --> 0:31:35.480
section in a minute.

421
0:31:35.480 --> 0:31:40.640
All right, it lets me go back here.

422
0:31:40.640 --> 0:31:43.320
So I'm assuming that it went super well when I wrote this.

423
0:31:43.320 --> 0:31:50.160
I'm going to give myself three and a half out of five stars on that one.

424
0:31:50.160 --> 0:31:51.480
So can you do this?

425
0:31:51.480 --> 0:31:58.120
I think this little demo shows that for most purposes what people are used to on a daily

426
0:31:58.120 --> 0:32:03.560
basis using their systems, collaborating with each other, et cetera, it is in fact possible

427
0:32:03.560 --> 0:32:05.640
to do it.

428
0:32:05.640 --> 0:32:10.560
I think the user interface is far more consistent than if you compare this to a hot patch of

429
0:32:10.560 --> 0:32:14.400
different cloud services with different login systems.

430
0:32:14.400 --> 0:32:16.280
Different access control systems.

431
0:32:16.280 --> 0:32:19.000
Again, predictable and controllable cost.

432
0:32:19.000 --> 0:32:22.320
You know how much it's going to cost when you start the month compared to how much it's

433
0:32:22.320 --> 0:32:25.480
going to cost at the end.

434
0:32:25.480 --> 0:32:29.560
I think you end up spending less time managing access control.

435
0:32:29.560 --> 0:32:32.240
You just have this one list of groups and members.

436
0:32:32.240 --> 0:32:35.280
You look at who is a member of that group and you know what access they have and you

437
0:32:35.280 --> 0:32:40.120
also know that if you take them out of the group, they will cease having that access.

438
0:32:40.120 --> 0:32:46.200
And that way you also lose less time on people not being able to access things that they

439
0:32:46.200 --> 0:32:51.080
need for their jobs.

440
0:32:51.080 --> 0:32:58.880
So as part of writing this talk, I was setting up the mega corp.icu, various containers, et

441
0:32:58.880 --> 0:33:03.040
cetera, and taking some of the containers that I was running in production and filing

442
0:33:03.040 --> 0:33:07.600
off the serial numbers of the specific things that I used them for.

443
0:33:07.600 --> 0:33:10.800
And I realized that maybe these could be useful for other people as well.

444
0:33:10.800 --> 0:33:17.320
So I created a GitHub project called mega corp.icu that has the containers that were

445
0:33:17.320 --> 0:33:25.000
used in this talk in it as well as some of the tools that I use to manage this.

446
0:33:25.000 --> 0:33:30.680
Perhaps if other people are interested in running their own infrastructures in at least

447
0:33:30.680 --> 0:33:35.360
somewhat the same way that I'm proposing, perhaps we can do some kind of collaboration

448
0:33:35.360 --> 0:33:39.760
with each other and do a sort of CS admin support group.

449
0:33:39.760 --> 0:33:43.560
I don't know.

450
0:33:43.560 --> 0:33:44.560
So questions?

451
0:33:44.560 --> 0:33:51.520
I think I'm a little ahead of where I'm supposed to be, but maybe there will be a lot of questions.

452
0:33:51.520 --> 0:33:54.520
A little plug, as I was just told, that you should always be selling.

453
0:33:54.520 --> 0:33:57.360
My company, Romatuck, is actively hiring people.

454
0:33:57.360 --> 0:34:02.880
So if any of this sounds like it could be you, please contact me.

455
0:34:02.880 --> 0:34:03.880
Okay.

456
0:34:03.880 --> 0:34:07.560
So we've got one roving microphone for questions, but we're going to go online first because

457
0:34:07.560 --> 0:34:09.360
there's some online questions.

458
0:34:09.360 --> 0:34:10.360
Yeah.

459
0:34:10.360 --> 0:34:13.280
The chat's blowing up with this question right here.

460
0:34:13.280 --> 0:34:19.640
What do you think about so-called totally automatic solutions like Unohost or Sandstorm?

461
0:34:19.640 --> 0:34:22.960
Would they also be sufficient for a small business?

462
0:34:22.960 --> 0:34:30.840
So I actually started off using Sandstorm, but found that the access control that Sandstorm

463
0:34:30.840 --> 0:34:38.320
offers is actually not quite...

464
0:34:38.320 --> 0:34:44.760
So with Sandstorm, what usually ends up happening is that you deploy different instances of

465
0:34:44.760 --> 0:34:53.240
the same application that different people will have access to.

466
0:34:53.240 --> 0:34:59.600
What I found is that moving people between groups didn't work properly for that, specifically

467
0:34:59.600 --> 0:35:05.000
if somebody gets kicked out of a container, sharing things between things tended to get

468
0:35:05.000 --> 0:35:07.040
a little weird.

469
0:35:07.040 --> 0:35:16.360
I would say that if it works for you, use it, it didn't work for me personally.

470
0:35:16.360 --> 0:35:20.080
So I have another story.

471
0:35:20.080 --> 0:35:22.320
I started with a small startup.

472
0:35:22.320 --> 0:35:23.800
I was the assistant administrator.

473
0:35:23.800 --> 0:35:24.880
I set up...

474
0:35:24.880 --> 0:35:29.920
Can I ask you the question, please?

475
0:35:29.920 --> 0:35:34.480
So I started to install all the FOSS infrastructure.

476
0:35:34.480 --> 0:35:35.680
It was beautiful.

477
0:35:35.680 --> 0:35:36.680
Next cloud.

478
0:35:36.680 --> 0:35:40.920
I had the audio and many other things.

479
0:35:40.920 --> 0:35:42.880
And then the company got bigger.

480
0:35:42.880 --> 0:35:49.360
And then the president of the company said, I don't like how next cloud link calendars

481
0:35:49.360 --> 0:35:50.640
to email.

482
0:35:50.640 --> 0:35:56.360
And so the next month we switched to Google Doc completely entirely, and the throwaway

483
0:35:56.360 --> 0:36:00.360
all my work of two years and I cried.

484
0:36:00.360 --> 0:36:04.800
So how do you do with the users?

485
0:36:04.800 --> 0:36:07.960
You are the boss that would love to have you as my boss.

486
0:36:07.960 --> 0:36:12.320
But how do you convince users actually to comply?

487
0:36:12.320 --> 0:36:20.520
Well, again, do you need me to repeat the question?

488
0:36:20.520 --> 0:36:25.200
So in my case, indeed, none of that really applies because I am the boss of these companies

489
0:36:25.200 --> 0:36:26.640
and the CEO of both.

490
0:36:26.640 --> 0:36:31.960
So to a certain extent, if you don't like it.

491
0:36:31.960 --> 0:36:35.960
But in practice, people tend to do like it.

492
0:36:35.960 --> 0:36:39.480
Of course, if you have someone that says, okay, I only know how to use this one thing

493
0:36:39.480 --> 0:36:44.320
and I refuse to use anything else, if that person is the CEO of the company, that is

494
0:36:44.320 --> 0:36:47.440
a problem.

495
0:36:47.440 --> 0:36:53.800
I don't really have a good answer for you other than try to convince them that there

496
0:36:53.800 --> 0:36:55.240
are some benefits to this.

497
0:36:55.240 --> 0:36:57.520
In the end, it's their money, right?

498
0:36:57.520 --> 0:37:03.000
So if they are willing to pay, I don't know, $30, $40 a month per user because they don't

499
0:37:03.000 --> 0:37:08.280
like how these things are linked, there is only so much you can do at some point.

500
0:37:08.280 --> 0:37:11.960
Okay, we are going to take an online question and then I am going to go over there for the

501
0:37:11.960 --> 0:37:12.960
next question.

502
0:37:12.960 --> 0:37:14.440
Keep your hands up if you want to ask a question.

503
0:37:14.440 --> 0:37:19.040
I have got a chance of keeping an eye on you.

504
0:37:19.040 --> 0:37:23.120
Okay, so what do you think of Cloudron?

505
0:37:23.120 --> 0:37:24.680
So can you repeat the question, please?

506
0:37:24.680 --> 0:37:27.080
What do you think of Cloudron?

507
0:37:27.080 --> 0:37:29.160
I am not familiar with that.

508
0:37:29.160 --> 0:37:31.840
Have you heard of Cloudron?

509
0:37:31.840 --> 0:37:34.080
Are you aware of Co-op Cloud?

510
0:37:34.080 --> 0:37:35.840
That's another question on the...

511
0:37:35.840 --> 0:37:37.120
I am not, no.

512
0:37:37.120 --> 0:37:48.920
All right, some good ideas here from the people.

513
0:37:48.920 --> 0:37:50.360
What do you use for documentation?

514
0:37:50.360 --> 0:37:53.160
Can you repeat the question, please?

515
0:37:53.160 --> 0:37:59.720
What do you recommend for documentation, like an alternative for conference or notion?

516
0:37:59.720 --> 0:38:01.840
So it's the question, what do you use for video conference?

517
0:38:01.840 --> 0:38:05.320
No, no, no, for documentation, internal documentation for the company.

518
0:38:05.320 --> 0:38:08.480
Oh, what do you use for internal documentation for the company?

519
0:38:08.480 --> 0:38:09.480
Yes.

520
0:38:09.480 --> 0:38:15.720
So in the case of prehensile tales, I use XWiki, which also integrates beautifully with

521
0:38:15.720 --> 0:38:17.560
this whole thing.

522
0:38:17.560 --> 0:38:23.120
People get access to sub pages based on group memberships, etc.

523
0:38:23.120 --> 0:38:27.360
Or user documentation that's not intended to be changed.

524
0:38:27.360 --> 0:38:32.920
So I wrote a little manual on how to do certain simple things on the mail server.

525
0:38:32.920 --> 0:38:36.560
Those are just files that are in a shared folder on the next cloud that everyone has

526
0:38:36.560 --> 0:38:41.560
access to.

527
0:38:41.560 --> 0:38:42.560
Thanks for the talk.

528
0:38:42.560 --> 0:38:43.600
Very interesting.

529
0:38:43.600 --> 0:38:47.120
One question, I guess all your services are publicly available.

530
0:38:47.120 --> 0:38:50.560
So does Keyclog support something like a two-factor authentication?

531
0:38:50.560 --> 0:38:51.560
Yes.

532
0:38:51.560 --> 0:38:53.600
Keyclog does support two-factor authentication.

533
0:38:53.600 --> 0:38:59.400
You can simply add, actually let's not do a demo for something I haven't looked at.

534
0:38:59.400 --> 0:39:02.040
I will not make that mistake.

535
0:39:02.040 --> 0:39:06.360
But yeah, you can add an authenticator app to your account on Keyclog.

536
0:39:06.360 --> 0:39:12.240
And I do that for myself because my account tends to have admin privileges, etc. on a

537
0:39:12.240 --> 0:39:14.660
lot of stuff.

538
0:39:14.660 --> 0:39:19.720
It is possible to also tell configure Keyclog such to make it mandatory for every user that

539
0:39:19.720 --> 0:39:27.840
logs in to set up a two-factor, with an authenticator app.

540
0:39:27.840 --> 0:39:32.680
One thing to keep track of though, because this is something that can in fact take you,

541
0:39:32.680 --> 0:39:34.040
lose you a lot of time.

542
0:39:34.040 --> 0:39:38.600
If you do set it up, make sure you have an MTP client running on all your servers, because

543
0:39:38.600 --> 0:39:40.920
that's going to take you a while to figure out.

544
0:39:40.920 --> 0:39:41.920
Yes.

545
0:39:41.920 --> 0:39:44.000
I have a question.

546
0:39:44.000 --> 0:39:52.520
How do you deal with security since you're running Nextcloud and Keyclog on premise?

547
0:39:52.520 --> 0:39:58.120
You said in some slides before that you update your systems like between 12 and 18 months.

548
0:39:58.120 --> 0:39:59.400
That is not a problem.

549
0:39:59.400 --> 0:40:03.880
But then again, security issues like rapidly rise up, and especially if you're on the public

550
0:40:03.880 --> 0:40:11.160
internet or facing the public internet, you run into, well, huge risks when you are not

551
0:40:11.160 --> 0:40:14.600
on the problem at hand.

552
0:40:14.600 --> 0:40:27.800
I mean, huge risks, sure, in the sense that if a worm were to be developed that goes through

553
0:40:27.800 --> 0:40:35.360
Keyclog directly and it doesn't get patched until it is all wired over the internet, then

554
0:40:35.360 --> 0:40:39.040
that might be a problem.

555
0:40:39.040 --> 0:40:46.960
But in the actual so far security updates for things like Keyclog, Nextcloud, et cetera,

556
0:40:46.960 --> 0:40:55.160
you just become at a cadence of once every month, month and a half, you basically just

557
0:40:55.160 --> 0:40:59.480
tell your Potman container stack to pull the new images and you restart them.

558
0:40:59.480 --> 0:41:04.160
It's two, three minutes of work usually.

559
0:41:04.160 --> 0:41:10.960
So again, it is a concern, but it's not something that's going to be your job to deal with this.

560
0:41:10.960 --> 0:41:15.760
It's two minutes, three minutes to install more security updates most of the time.

561
0:41:15.760 --> 0:41:25.200
Okay, so the question is how do you know that you need to update something?

562
0:41:25.200 --> 0:41:32.920
I just run these pools and updates like every two, three weeks, because like you pointed

563
0:41:32.920 --> 0:41:37.160
out, I don't want it to be my job to figure out all the security updates that are available

564
0:41:37.160 --> 0:41:43.520
for everything, so I just install everything every couple of weeks.

565
0:41:43.520 --> 0:41:49.400
Next question is can you use Purelyfoss for the non-engineering aspects of the company?

566
0:41:49.400 --> 0:41:53.800
For example, accounting software that is compliant with state requirements for regular digital

567
0:41:53.800 --> 0:41:55.600
submission?

568
0:41:55.600 --> 0:42:01.280
So the question is can you use it for things like administrative software and stuff?

569
0:42:01.280 --> 0:42:06.920
I frankly don't know, because I cheat in that regard is that I have an accountant and every

570
0:42:06.920 --> 0:42:11.840
month I send them an email with a pile of PDFs in it and then I get a PDF pack that

571
0:42:11.840 --> 0:42:15.760
says how much taxes they have to pay or return.

572
0:42:15.760 --> 0:42:16.760
I don't know.

573
0:42:16.760 --> 0:42:18.640
I don't have the answer to that question.

574
0:42:18.640 --> 0:42:22.120
But hiring an accountant is a good idea.

575
0:42:22.120 --> 0:42:30.480
If you're ever at the size of one or two people, just get an accountant.

576
0:42:30.480 --> 0:42:34.680
Thanks for the cool presentation.

577
0:42:34.680 --> 0:42:40.240
Since the key word here is to keep things simple, I believe in Key Clock you can have

578
0:42:40.240 --> 0:42:43.600
all the users created locally and have them in Key Clock.

579
0:42:43.600 --> 0:42:50.000
What's the benefit of having LDAP behind that to keep track of the users and having...

580
0:42:50.000 --> 0:42:53.880
So the question is why, if you want to keep things simple, why not just create local users?

581
0:42:53.880 --> 0:42:58.000
Because then you end up with the same problem that you started with with different cloud

582
0:42:58.000 --> 0:42:59.000
tools.

583
0:42:59.000 --> 0:43:04.120
Now you have to manage individual access to different tools yourself again.

584
0:43:04.120 --> 0:43:10.520
The fact that there is a group, human resources, that easily works across all the systems means

585
0:43:10.520 --> 0:43:16.120
that the mail server knows who's a member of human resources, next cloud knows who's

586
0:43:16.120 --> 0:43:23.800
a member of human resources, and rocket chat knows who's a member of human resources.

587
0:43:23.800 --> 0:43:34.160
So it just lowers the burden to take that one little bit of extra complexity.

588
0:43:34.160 --> 0:43:38.800
In return you get back this one single thing you have to administer instead of figuring

589
0:43:38.800 --> 0:43:40.680
out how to do that across multiple things.

590
0:43:40.680 --> 0:43:46.520
Also from a purely practical point of view, most programs will support LDAP.

591
0:43:46.520 --> 0:43:50.840
Fewer and fewer programs now support things like PAM or anything like that.

592
0:43:50.840 --> 0:44:01.440
LDAP kind of is what PAM used to be in that respect, for good or bad.

593
0:44:01.440 --> 0:44:08.440
You've been talking about using this in small or small-age companies.

594
0:44:08.440 --> 0:44:14.520
Do you foresee at which point this would not work anymore, like in terms of size of the

595
0:44:14.520 --> 0:44:16.480
company?

596
0:44:16.480 --> 0:44:27.400
So I think there's going to be an inflection point specifically when vertical scaling stops

597
0:44:27.400 --> 0:44:28.960
to work, basically.

598
0:44:28.960 --> 0:44:35.000
So if I need more than one piece of hardware to run all of the chat users on, I think at

599
0:44:35.000 --> 0:44:38.640
that point it's going to be a problem.

600
0:44:38.640 --> 0:44:45.200
If I get so many files that I cannot reasonably store them any longer on a server that you

601
0:44:45.200 --> 0:44:52.760
can reasonably rent, right now you can get a rate one NVMe server with two times four

602
0:44:52.760 --> 0:44:58.960
terabytes of disk space for like $100 a month.

603
0:44:58.960 --> 0:45:04.040
Once things like that stop scaling, I think that is when you might start to have a problem.

604
0:45:04.040 --> 0:45:07.160
The way I think about that, though, is by the time I have that problem, I will also

605
0:45:07.160 --> 0:45:16.400
probably have enough people to get a sysadmin to figure that stuff out for me.

606
0:45:16.400 --> 0:45:21.920
How often have you had to report or fix bugs in the stack that you're using?

607
0:45:21.920 --> 0:45:24.320
How often do you have to fix and report bugs?

608
0:45:24.320 --> 0:45:29.920
So that is exactly how often I don't know.

609
0:45:29.920 --> 0:45:33.960
I'm not going to lie, that happens with some regularity.

610
0:45:33.960 --> 0:45:40.400
I currently have a bug open with Nextcloud, for instance, that sometimes the avatar icons

611
0:45:40.400 --> 0:45:43.080
disappear.

612
0:45:43.080 --> 0:45:44.080
That is annoying.

613
0:45:44.080 --> 0:45:45.600
Things like that are annoying.

614
0:45:45.600 --> 0:45:50.520
But then again, I also have had bugs open for pieces of software I've paid for that

615
0:45:50.520 --> 0:45:53.560
are never fixed.

616
0:45:53.560 --> 0:45:59.360
It's not a panacea, I believe is the word you, is how you pronounce that.

617
0:45:59.360 --> 0:46:05.360
But it's not something, it's not like the things are constantly breaking and I'm constantly

618
0:46:05.360 --> 0:46:06.840
fixing things.

619
0:46:06.840 --> 0:46:07.840
Absolutely not.

620
0:46:07.840 --> 0:46:10.840
A minute ago there was a question up here.

621
0:46:10.840 --> 0:46:11.840
Has it gone away?

622
0:46:11.840 --> 0:46:12.840
Just in this front block here.

623
0:46:12.840 --> 0:46:17.840
No, right, okay, we'll go over here.

624
0:46:17.840 --> 0:46:22.800
Keeps me fit.

625
0:46:22.800 --> 0:46:24.240
Somebody's getting some steps.

626
0:46:24.240 --> 0:46:25.240
Hi, thanks.

627
0:46:25.240 --> 0:46:29.040
That was a really good talk.

628
0:46:29.040 --> 0:46:54.280
I think the question is, is there anyone in the room who does know how to do open source

629
0:46:54.280 --> 0:46:55.280
accounting?

630
0:46:55.280 --> 0:46:56.800
Is it certainly not me?

631
0:46:56.800 --> 0:47:02.480
That has a second vote from me as well.

632
0:47:02.480 --> 0:47:03.480
Anyone?

633
0:47:03.480 --> 0:47:10.000
Hold up, put your hand up.

634
0:47:10.000 --> 0:47:14.120
VRP Next, you say?

635
0:47:14.120 --> 0:47:15.120
PRP?

636
0:47:15.120 --> 0:47:16.120
I'm sorry.

637
0:47:16.120 --> 0:47:17.120
I'm sorry.

638
0:47:17.120 --> 0:47:18.120
I'm sorry.

639
0:47:18.120 --> 0:47:19.120
I'm sorry.

640
0:47:19.120 --> 0:47:20.120
I'm sorry.

641
0:47:20.120 --> 0:47:21.120
I'm sorry.

642
0:47:21.120 --> 0:47:22.120
I'm sorry.

643
0:47:22.120 --> 0:47:23.120
I'm sorry.

644
0:47:23.120 --> 0:47:24.120
I'm sorry.

645
0:47:24.120 --> 0:47:25.120
I'm sorry.

646
0:47:25.120 --> 0:47:26.120
I'm sorry.

647
0:47:26.120 --> 0:47:27.120
I'm sorry.

648
0:47:27.120 --> 0:47:28.120
No, that's not.

649
0:47:28.120 --> 0:47:29.120
No.

650
0:47:29.120 --> 0:47:30.120
Every regulation is in it.

651
0:47:30.120 --> 0:47:31.240
You have to build it yourself.

652
0:47:31.240 --> 0:47:36.240
But ERP Next is an open source solution to manage your accounting stuff.

653
0:47:36.240 --> 0:47:37.240
Cool.

654
0:47:37.240 --> 0:47:38.240
Thank you.

655
0:47:38.240 --> 0:47:43.100
Did we have more questions?

656
0:47:43.100 --> 0:47:45.600
I have a question here.

657
0:47:45.600 --> 0:47:51.000
How much time is needed in on average per month to set up the infrastructure and maintain

658
0:47:51.000 --> 0:47:53.420
it?

659
0:47:53.420 --> 0:47:59.460
up the infrastructure, well, I felt like it wasn't too much work to set up an entirely

660
0:47:59.460 --> 0:48:01.400
new infrastructure just for this talk.

661
0:48:01.400 --> 0:48:07.660
So I mean, it should give you some indication that it's not like a weeks-long process.

662
0:48:07.660 --> 0:48:10.860
As in how much time does it take me per month to run this?

663
0:48:10.860 --> 0:48:16.140
It is a little bit variable.

664
0:48:16.140 --> 0:48:25.620
So just installing security updates and just keeping those things running maybe...

665
0:48:25.620 --> 0:48:27.340
So it's never consecutive, right?

666
0:48:27.340 --> 0:48:37.340
I think it's fair to say that I spent about an hour a month maintaining the infrastructure.

667
0:48:37.340 --> 0:48:41.420
I don't think I spent a whole lot more than that.

668
0:48:41.420 --> 0:48:47.980
Of course this number can ramp up rather dramatically if you get a hardware failure, like a broken

669
0:48:47.980 --> 0:48:52.860
hard drive in a server can now mean that you have to spend two or three hours talking with

670
0:48:52.860 --> 0:48:58.740
your data center people planning to get a disk replaced, waiting for the disk to be

671
0:48:58.740 --> 0:49:02.100
replaced, putting it back in your rates at et cetera.

672
0:49:02.100 --> 0:49:05.620
So at that point you might lose a couple more hours.

673
0:49:05.620 --> 0:49:13.380
But yeah, it's in the order of hours per month, not days.

674
0:49:13.380 --> 0:49:16.980
Hi.

675
0:49:16.980 --> 0:49:19.980
Have you tried to do it in high availability?

676
0:49:19.980 --> 0:49:25.900
So do you have any problems with like a next layer of the complication?

677
0:49:25.900 --> 0:49:32.060
If you have one key clock in machine A, then second key clock on machine B or data center

678
0:49:32.060 --> 0:49:35.620
B, what's your idea here?

679
0:49:35.620 --> 0:49:39.580
Because if you use, I don't know, Google, it's just one Gmail comment.

680
0:49:39.580 --> 0:49:41.060
Yeah, you are fine.

681
0:49:41.060 --> 0:49:44.840
Yeah, so the question is what do you do about redundancy?

682
0:49:44.840 --> 0:49:48.580
So there's actually one of those things where it's very easy to fall into a trap and which

683
0:49:48.580 --> 0:49:51.660
is kind of what this talk was hoped to be about.

684
0:49:51.660 --> 0:49:55.020
It's that you don't really need that most of the time.

685
0:49:55.020 --> 0:49:57.100
Make sure that your data is safe.

686
0:49:57.100 --> 0:50:04.220
But if you have a company of 10, 15, 20 people, if people can't log in in the middle of the

687
0:50:04.220 --> 0:50:09.020
night, it means that you are also sleeping and all your employees are also sleeping.

688
0:50:09.020 --> 0:50:15.700
So this is not something that worries me at all.

689
0:50:15.700 --> 0:50:19.340
It's not to say that, again, not to say that you should never worry about it, not saying

690
0:50:19.340 --> 0:50:22.740
that anyone who does worry about it is wrong.

691
0:50:22.740 --> 0:50:28.140
But just in the type of deployment that I'm talking about, a couple of hours downtime

692
0:50:28.140 --> 0:50:30.100
is not the end of the world.

693
0:50:30.100 --> 0:50:33.420
And we've seen it's not the end of the world because Azure just went down for like seven

694
0:50:33.420 --> 0:50:36.740
hours and we're all still here.

695
0:50:36.740 --> 0:50:38.620
Okay.

696
0:50:38.620 --> 0:50:39.620
Thank you all very much.

697
0:50:39.620 --> 0:50:41.500
Thank you, HP, for your talk.

698
0:50:41.500 --> 0:50:42.500
That's great.

699
0:50:42.500 --> 0:50:43.500
So a question.

700
0:50:43.500 --> 0:50:53.460
Thank you for coming.
