WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Well, thank you everyone for attending.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.960
It's lovely to see all of you.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.040
My name's Mike.

00:13.040 --> 00:20.040
I go on mine under the handle Nolski, so you'll find me as Nolski in the Matrix chat as well

00:20.040 --> 00:22.520
as in IRC.

00:22.520 --> 00:28.320
I have a bunch of titles because I choose to have titles instead of a social life.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.240
But probably the most important in the context of this talk is the bottom one.

00:33.240 --> 00:37.280
I am a scholar of political economy of science and technology.

00:37.280 --> 00:42.400
I'm a graduate student, and this is kind of the field that I study.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.080
So political economy is kind of a funny word, but essentially what it means is it's the

00:47.080 --> 00:52.480
study of how economic systems and political systems are intrinsically linked.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.000
And so this framing is really what drives the analysis of my talk today.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.120
And so political economy has been around for a very long time.

01:01.120 --> 01:06.760
It's been the primary subject of many very, very famous and loved thinkers throughout

01:06.760 --> 01:09.480
history that I'm not going to name.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.640
But, you know, what are we talking about here today?

01:13.640 --> 01:19.160
Well, first I want to do a quick history of free and open source software, like a very

01:19.160 --> 01:24.000
abridged one to kind of drive home a couple of questions I've been asking myself over

01:24.000 --> 01:25.320
the last few years.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.880
Second, I want to kind of posit a question about are we really building the same software

01:30.880 --> 01:36.640
now that we were when the initial foundations of the ideology around free software began?

01:36.640 --> 01:40.880
And if we aren't, how is this software we're building today different?

01:40.880 --> 01:45.680
Then I want to talk about kind of where we are today as a community, as a society and

01:45.680 --> 01:46.680
ideologically.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.440
And then lastly, I kind of want to, you know, posit some questions that will hopefully generate

01:51.440 --> 01:57.000
a very lively but hopefully respectful discussion that adheres to the code of conduct with this

01:57.000 --> 01:59.040
event.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.520
So let's get started.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.600
Or actually, let's not get started because I talked to my boss and I have to give a couple

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
disclaimers.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.920
So first, you know, I want to I'm going to be talking about politics here and economics

02:10.920 --> 02:12.960
of free software.

02:12.960 --> 02:18.160
And I want to be clear, you know, this talk, it doesn't seek to analyze or make any stance

02:18.160 --> 02:23.880
on like the morality of who you work for or whether your employer makes you a good person

02:23.880 --> 02:25.200
or a bad person.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.960
It doesn't even seek to analyze whether certain organizations are good or bad.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.240
This talk is to analyze the structures that exist in our technological production and

02:36.240 --> 02:40.840
see whether, you know, we might be interested in changing those structures, not like who

02:40.840 --> 02:42.640
is good and bad.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.240
Furthermore, I got to read this verbatim according to my boss.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.920
The views and opinions expressed in this program are those of the speakers and do not necessarily

02:53.920 --> 02:58.640
reflect the views or positions of any entities that I represent.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.480
So now that that's out of the way, thank you.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
Yes.

03:03.480 --> 03:08.600
So hopefully I will have a job when I get back home.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.360
So let's do a quick timeline of free and open source software.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.360
This is very abridged, so I'm leaving out parts for brevity so we can have a discussion

03:18.360 --> 03:20.240
and focus on other things.

03:20.240 --> 03:27.960
But in general, for this talk, I want to bisect the history of FOSS into two periods.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.880
And these dates are very generalized, but the first period I would argue is between

03:32.880 --> 03:37.040
the 70s and the early naughts.

03:37.040 --> 03:43.000
Really during the beginning of this period, computing hardware was just becoming starting

03:43.000 --> 03:44.640
to become standardized.

03:44.640 --> 03:49.000
Previously, if you bought a computing machine, it would come with the software provided by

03:49.000 --> 03:54.600
the manufacturer, and it was custom made for that model, and you couldn't easily transfer

03:54.600 --> 03:58.320
software from one model by one manufacturer into another.

03:58.320 --> 04:03.000
But soon after, hardware architectures became standardized.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.580
And so people could write software that runs on many different kinds of machines.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.120
They could share it with each other.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.640
They could trade it.

04:09.640 --> 04:14.080
And software became what's called a commodity.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.560
And so this generated all sorts of new industries that I'm sure you're all aware of within information

04:20.560 --> 04:23.080
technology and so on.

04:23.080 --> 04:28.560
And as part of this, businesses formed to develop and sell software and services around

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
that software.

04:29.560 --> 04:35.820
And at the same time, so too did communities of practice, of production, that sort of formed

04:35.820 --> 04:42.840
the early ideas of what we imagine as open source or free software communities.

04:42.840 --> 04:50.000
And so from this situation, arose the beginnings of what I would call one of the foundational

04:50.000 --> 04:54.200
ideological pillars of free and open source software.

04:54.200 --> 05:00.320
In particular, Richard Stallman proposed these four essential rights or freedoms for users

05:00.320 --> 05:09.200
as this core ideological pillar of what free software should allow and be about.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.320
These aren't licensing terms, but rather a stance ideologically.

05:14.320 --> 05:22.880
Specifically, it's for any software user obtains, they should be able to use it for whatever

05:22.880 --> 05:24.080
purpose they want.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.360
They should be able to understand how it works.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.040
They should be able to share it onward to whoever they think might want it.

05:30.040 --> 05:35.520
And they should be able to modify it to suit their own needs and improve it potentially.

05:35.520 --> 05:41.360
And so one thing I'm really interested in considering during this period is the underlying

05:41.360 --> 05:49.420
assumptions and technological context during when these four freedoms were initially positive.

05:49.420 --> 05:54.520
At this time, most software was this very discreet thing that oftentimes came in a box

05:54.520 --> 05:57.480
or on a floppy disk or whatever.

05:57.480 --> 06:02.800
And when you ran it, it was on your own machine, it was limited in its size and complexity,

06:02.800 --> 06:09.960
it was portable and understandable largely, and it was discreet.

06:09.960 --> 06:16.860
So many businesses at the time would license their software in this way that explicitly

06:16.860 --> 06:20.240
forbade these rights.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.120
You can download my copy of Windows, but you have to pay for it and you can't modify it

06:24.120 --> 06:26.480
and you can't do whatever.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.680
And so this causes tension between these communities of developers creating free and open source

06:30.680 --> 06:35.720
software and businesses who were specifically seeking to profit off of their ability to

06:35.720 --> 06:40.160
generate revenue through these proprietary licensing strategies.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.960
You know, Bill Gates had this infamous quote where he referred to free software activists

06:45.960 --> 06:48.920
at the time as communists on a television interview.

06:48.920 --> 06:56.460
And I would argue if you talk to folks from this period, many free software organizations

06:56.460 --> 07:02.560
actually struggled with being labeled as communists or anarchists at the time.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.040
And so this was kind of almost like a meme.

07:06.040 --> 07:13.800
And just as a disclaimer here before I get sued, this poster wasn't made by Microsoft.

07:13.800 --> 07:18.200
So this poster was a meme created by someone else.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.000
So this is not representing Microsoft's views at the time or now.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.720
So Microsoft, please do not sue me for false light.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.640
So anyways, this struggle led to there being many projects and products, both open source

07:34.640 --> 07:37.240
and proprietary, right?

07:37.240 --> 07:41.200
Oftentimes, like competing products, right?

07:41.200 --> 07:45.640
And many businesses offered their own solutions that actively marketed against open source

07:45.640 --> 07:50.840
software alternatives that were trying to accomplish the same goals, fulfill the same

07:50.840 --> 07:55.680
features as their proprietary counterparts, right?

07:55.680 --> 08:00.320
And these businesses, a lot of their ideas at the time is they're relying on their greater

08:00.320 --> 08:07.280
cohesion to try to build a better product and software ecosystem when compared to their

08:07.280 --> 08:10.080
sometimes fragmented open source alternative.

08:10.080 --> 08:16.280
And this is how they seek to try to capture the market for any given use case, right?

08:16.280 --> 08:22.560
So in short, we had this situation where we see directly competing products whose common

08:22.560 --> 08:25.480
differentiator is really their licensing strategy.

08:25.480 --> 08:29.160
This is the thing that made them stand out apart from each other, right?

08:29.160 --> 08:34.960
You got Windows and Linux, you got Firefox and Internet Explorer, you got OpenGL and DirectX,

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
right?

08:35.960 --> 08:40.640
All these were competing products to see which was better.

08:40.640 --> 08:48.160
And all these cases as a competition between which organization, the community or the firm,

08:48.160 --> 08:51.560
could build what capacities more effectively, right?

08:51.560 --> 08:57.840
And many of our debates and discussion at the time revolved around which method of production

08:57.840 --> 09:01.480
was more efficient at building these capacities.

09:01.480 --> 09:06.840
And I'm sure even if you go around today or you talk to your friends, we still hear these

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
discussions, right?

09:07.840 --> 09:12.840
When we're talking about trying to encourage people to develop open source, it's more effective.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.400
It's just easier, we can share costs.

09:15.400 --> 09:22.280
And so during this time, licensing was this huge part, if not the most important part,

09:22.280 --> 09:26.720
of when we thought about the battle between free and open source software and proprietary

09:26.720 --> 09:27.720
software ecosystems.

09:27.720 --> 09:33.040
You know, IP rights at the time were really coming to a fore with the advent of a lot

09:33.040 --> 09:36.120
of digital intellectual property.

09:36.120 --> 09:43.320
And when considering this initial ideology focused on user autonomy, freedom, user autonomy

09:43.320 --> 09:49.960
and freedom, this idea of IP ownership in order to facilitate that through licensing

09:49.960 --> 09:56.380
was like the sort of core method that many people thought about how to achieve this sort

09:56.380 --> 10:00.920
of more ideological goal, right?

10:00.920 --> 10:07.200
So now I want to kind of jump ahead to the sort of second phase where we are today, right?

10:07.200 --> 10:12.560
So this relationship between open source and proprietary software, it didn't really stay

10:12.560 --> 10:14.400
this way, right?

10:14.400 --> 10:18.560
Now as we all know, as you come to any one of these conferences, you've probably seen

10:18.560 --> 10:21.440
this statistic already today.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.680
Free and open source software has become this foundational infrastructure upon which like

10:25.680 --> 10:29.880
pretty much all of our digital services are built, right?

10:29.880 --> 10:35.720
And before I go ahead, I just want to drop like a thank you and a note that a lot of

10:35.720 --> 10:41.320
the graphs I'm going to be showing in the next couple of slides come from this amazing

10:41.320 --> 10:46.120
2021 report written by the Digital Commons Policy Council.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.480
So I got a link to that policy council in the slides, which you can download off of

10:50.480 --> 10:51.720
the FOSDEM website.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.120
I encourage you to check it out, but they did a lot of really great work for getting

10:56.120 --> 11:01.000
the data and the empirical sort of findings here.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.840
So anyways, you know, today we see some of the biggest antagonists towards free and open

11:05.840 --> 11:10.840
source software actually directing the most significant amounts of their workforce towards

11:10.840 --> 11:15.240
its support and budget, especially when compared to other firms, right?

11:15.240 --> 11:19.040
Microsoft was like the big bad in open source, right?

11:19.040 --> 11:23.360
And now they're actually one of the largest contributors of it, right?

11:23.360 --> 11:26.800
They're very much bought into open source software production.

11:26.800 --> 11:32.720
You know, not only have major firms changed their tune in relationship to each other,

11:32.720 --> 11:37.320
but now when we look at open source communities in the largest projects and most important

11:37.320 --> 11:42.880
projects on the internet, employees of these firms now generally outnumber independent

11:42.880 --> 11:43.880
contributors.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.800
And, you know, I'm careful to use the term independent here rather than volunteer because

11:48.800 --> 11:54.480
independent contributors are oftentimes contributing in the context of like an organization or

11:54.480 --> 12:01.240
institution, but it's not really one that is focused specifically on maximizing profit

12:01.240 --> 12:02.600
for themselves.

12:02.600 --> 12:07.640
So these types of contributors, I would argue, face like very different incentives in terms

12:07.640 --> 12:10.720
of like what they're trying to build and for what purpose.

12:10.720 --> 12:19.240
Furthermore, you know, as time has gone on, the ratio of firm employees to the independent

12:19.240 --> 12:23.040
contributor has increased steadily, right?

12:23.040 --> 12:29.800
So year over year in most or in pretty much all major projects, the amount of firm employees

12:29.800 --> 12:33.880
when compared to non-firm employees has increased, right?

12:33.880 --> 12:40.200
So this is not just like a finding, but it's a year over year trend that's increasing steadily.

12:40.200 --> 12:47.320
So I would argue one thing to note in this case then is that we can sort of find that

12:47.320 --> 12:52.680
independent contributors oftentimes have less power in these communities simply because

12:52.680 --> 12:59.360
they're being outnumbered by a much more cohesive group of other contributors and they just

12:59.360 --> 13:04.360
have less power to develop, right?

13:04.360 --> 13:10.160
And so while these projects are majorly developed at the explicit discretion of firms, right?

13:10.160 --> 13:15.960
What I think is most important is actually the shift between these two periods is actually

13:15.960 --> 13:22.660
how the form of software itself has shifted when thinking about open source software.

13:22.660 --> 13:27.840
So if you look at this list of projects, so this was I think the top 20 or 25 projects

13:27.840 --> 13:33.720
that the, in terms of like contributors and activity founded by the Digital Commons Policy

13:33.720 --> 13:35.240
Council.

13:35.240 --> 13:40.520
And if you look at this list, nearly all of these projects, they aren't really end user

13:40.520 --> 13:44.240
software anymore, even of the technical sort, right?

13:44.240 --> 13:49.880
Many are for use solely in the development of these sort of large scale products and

13:49.880 --> 13:57.160
platforms that can really only be applicable to users who have significant resources to

13:57.160 --> 13:58.720
run them, right?

13:58.720 --> 14:02.880
So like let's have a look, right?

14:02.880 --> 14:10.200
We got a number of server orchestration software such as like Kubernetes, Moby or Ansible.

14:10.200 --> 14:15.200
We also have machine learning and distributed systems projects such as like Spark, PyTorch

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
and TensorFlow.

14:16.200 --> 14:22.200
And I'm sure as you attend talks today, even at Fostom, a conference that's quite community

14:22.200 --> 14:26.680
focused, you'll likely find the majority of software programs being discussed are of this

14:26.680 --> 14:27.840
type.

14:27.840 --> 14:34.040
So why has the production of free and open source software shifted so incredibly to this

14:34.040 --> 14:41.340
one very kind of specific niche within software applications?

14:41.340 --> 14:48.040
So I'd like to argue that most of the software we interact with on a day to day basis, and

14:48.040 --> 14:54.320
you know maybe I'm leaning out of the free software developer archetype here when I'm

14:54.320 --> 14:59.400
saying this, but most of the software we interact with aren't really discrete applications

14:59.400 --> 15:03.600
anymore but rather what I would call platforms, right?

15:03.600 --> 15:09.360
And because of this, the relationship of much of our open source software and our proprietary

15:09.360 --> 15:13.120
software has like fundamentally changed, right?

15:13.120 --> 15:18.080
So why are these projects that are, you know, important now so different than the projects

15:18.080 --> 15:19.480
that were important before?

15:19.480 --> 15:24.920
Now I'd like to argue that many of the most powerful technology firms have largely pivoted

15:24.920 --> 15:30.960
away from licensing discrete software products as their core sort of revenue model to the

15:30.960 --> 15:38.280
development and, you know, managing of platforms to generate revenue for them.

15:38.280 --> 15:43.120
So you know, before we go forward, I'm sure you've all heard the term platform before,

15:43.120 --> 15:47.640
but I'd like to try to formally define it in economic terms, right?

15:47.640 --> 15:53.880
And so this sort of, I'm paraphrasing here, but this definition was first posited by

15:53.880 --> 15:59.200
a Nobel Prize winning economist, learner and to roll.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.600
So platforms, when we think about a platform, you oftentimes think about it like a software

16:03.600 --> 16:05.920
system or something like that, right?

16:05.920 --> 16:11.640
But these software systems aren't really commodities in themselves, but rather they're made as

16:11.640 --> 16:18.000
a system to manage access between like networks on two sides of a wall or like commodities

16:18.000 --> 16:19.840
on two sides of a wall.

16:19.840 --> 16:26.720
So to give an example of this, you know, Facebook is a platform which manages access to communities

16:26.720 --> 16:32.720
in media for end users on one side and then, you know, willing eyes, data and ad positioning

16:32.720 --> 16:34.960
for advertisers on the other side.

16:34.960 --> 16:39.440
And Facebook has kind of this monopolized access to both of these networks, right?

16:39.440 --> 16:42.640
Or at least like a very preferential access to both.

16:42.640 --> 16:49.680
You know, Amazon is a platform which facilitates access to distribution networks in a global

16:49.680 --> 16:55.040
marketplace for producers on one side and then a network of goods and services for consumers

16:55.040 --> 16:56.960
on the other side.

16:56.960 --> 17:01.040
Google is a platform which facilitates information and digital services for end users on one

17:01.040 --> 17:06.140
side and again, you know, willing eyes and user networks for those digital service providers

17:06.140 --> 17:08.240
and advertisers on the other.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.280
So the nature of the platform has positioned their creators to exploit what are called

17:13.280 --> 17:20.280
these multi-sided markets with these sort of two networks by acting as a mediator and

17:20.280 --> 17:27.760
a gatekeeper between access across this sort of divide.

17:27.760 --> 17:34.320
So you know, I'd like to posit this question to everyone that we always hear all the time.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.800
It's honestly probably getting a little old in the tooth.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.040
But you know, has open source won?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.680
Like you know, have we done it?

17:40.680 --> 17:44.880
We are foundational to the operation of like the entire world.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.440
You know, open source is really important.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.360
More people than ever are creating it, right?

17:50.360 --> 17:53.840
And so, you know, no, I don't think so.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.720
I mean, there's clearly more open source, right?

17:56.720 --> 18:01.600
There's probably a similar or larger proportion of open source software to proprietary software

18:01.600 --> 18:05.280
that we use on a daily basis, at least within the dependency chain.

18:05.280 --> 18:12.160
However, we still have little to no control over the vast majority of services that impact

18:12.160 --> 18:16.000
most people's lives, particularly digital services, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:22.200
From e-commerce to social media to healthcare provision, all of these, you know, might heavily

18:22.200 --> 18:26.280
rely on free and open source infrastructure to function.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.840
But we still have no actual control.

18:29.840 --> 18:35.120
So when we think about the ideological pillars of our movement in the first place, I don't

18:35.120 --> 18:39.000
see any significant gains in this area.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.280
So you know, to me, when looking at this history, it really seemed that many free and open source

18:45.280 --> 18:53.160
advocacy programs have been out-maneuvered in this way due to the shape of our software

18:53.160 --> 18:54.160
changing.

18:54.160 --> 19:00.160
So, you know, I know that's like a little depressing and everything.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.760
And I'm sure many people have a lot of opinions about maybe the validity of that.

19:05.760 --> 19:12.040
But I kind of want to talk about, well, if this is the case, right, and if this is a

19:12.040 --> 19:18.080
problem that we as a community are facing, then what do we do about it, right?

19:18.080 --> 19:24.400
So first I want to kind of review a couple of key points that I wanted to make.

19:24.400 --> 19:30.240
And then I want to, I know this is like a stage talk, but I want to have a lot of Q&A

19:30.240 --> 19:35.400
afterwards to have a discussion with the audience.

19:35.400 --> 19:40.320
So first and foremost, you know, I want to claim, you know, free and open source software

19:40.320 --> 19:45.080
isn't competing with proprietary software anymore in any significant way.

19:45.080 --> 19:52.640
I know there's, you know, probably examples, but when we look at the largest, most active,

19:52.640 --> 19:58.360
most important free and open source software projects, they are not competing with proprietary

19:58.360 --> 19:59.360
alternatives.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.480
They're helping host them, right?

20:01.480 --> 20:07.120
The second is our labor as free and open source software contributors in general is being

20:07.120 --> 20:09.720
increasingly dictated by firms.

20:09.720 --> 20:15.480
We see this year on year because we're being continually outnumbered by firm contributors.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.080
And we're having less of a say in the communities that we act in.

20:19.080 --> 20:24.960
You know, furthermore, more of us are working directly for firms when contributing and are

20:24.960 --> 20:28.040
therefore, you know, required to represent their interests.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.720
And even when we aren't, certainly the most important projects, our ability to dictate

20:32.720 --> 20:35.760
the direction of these is, you know, we're outnumbered.

20:35.760 --> 20:41.280
On the flip side, we are finding when these firms suffer any loss in their rate of profit,

20:41.280 --> 20:45.580
usually it is us who are among the first to be cut, right?

20:45.580 --> 20:50.920
This precarity and increasing control that firms have over our collective labor powers

20:50.920 --> 20:58.760
means that oftentimes we're losing autonomy as creators over our own labor.

20:58.760 --> 21:03.920
You know, so this original framing of user control over, you know, our software that

21:03.920 --> 21:09.480
we download and run on our machines, you know, I would argue is no longer relevant because

21:09.480 --> 21:16.120
we live in a time where, you know, we majority interact with these really complex, massive

21:16.120 --> 21:17.120
platforms.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.960
Most critical software we interact with is no longer these discrete packages offering

21:20.960 --> 21:26.140
specific functionality to users, but rather, you know, these platforms are gating and mediating

21:26.140 --> 21:30.880
access between markets, commodities, and other networks, right?

21:30.880 --> 21:36.200
Therefore, our original conception of simply increasing the amount of openly licensed software

21:36.200 --> 21:41.520
products is no longer as relevant as the projects we're building are largely infrastructure

21:41.520 --> 21:45.400
to maintain these platforms, right?

21:45.400 --> 21:51.400
So we can no longer avoid this very political question about how we attempt to reorganize

21:51.400 --> 21:58.000
free and open source software labor on behalf of these original ideals of, you know, user

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
rights.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.680
You know, labor organization has frequently been a topic avoided previously in free and

22:03.680 --> 22:09.440
open source software, and I would argue it was due to this major focus on licensing instead.

22:09.440 --> 22:14.000
You know, we didn't talk about, like, who we're working for or how we're organizing

22:14.000 --> 22:18.840
our work because we wanted to focus on where the ownership was, and if we can create more,

22:18.840 --> 22:25.200
you know, open licensed things, then the ownership goes to everyone, and then the power is distributed,

22:25.200 --> 22:29.340
and I would argue we've seen that we've been kind of outmaneuvered in that sense because

22:29.340 --> 22:35.160
our interaction with owned software has largely changed.

22:35.160 --> 22:39.880
So you know, this all sounds not great, but if this is the case, then how can we adopt

22:39.880 --> 22:45.080
a more sort of labor-oriented approach to the topic of free and open source values and

22:45.080 --> 22:46.360
ideals, right?

22:46.360 --> 22:54.400
How can you as a foster or me, you know, I'm not off the hook here, help bring about this

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
change?

22:55.400 --> 22:59.720
So, you know, I can't claim to have all the answers here.

22:59.720 --> 23:05.280
You know, I'm just a guy interested in this topic studying this stuff.

23:05.280 --> 23:09.120
Especially now, you know, I understand the topic of political change is a very touchy

23:09.120 --> 23:10.120
one.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.800
However, there are some ideas I've researched that I think would be, you know, at least

23:13.800 --> 23:18.360
worthwhile for us as a community to investigate further.

23:18.360 --> 23:23.760
The first is the idea of understanding that not all free and open source software contributions

23:23.760 --> 23:25.080
are equal.

23:25.080 --> 23:31.080
So when considering the value of free and open source software contributions, you know,

23:31.080 --> 23:35.960
maybe we should prioritize developing alternatives to existing platforms that are controlled

23:35.960 --> 23:37.660
by firms, right?

23:37.660 --> 23:41.960
And so when I say alternative here, I don't just mean an openly licensed clone, but rather

23:41.960 --> 23:48.520
a solution designed specifically with these ideals of user autonomy in mind, right?

23:48.520 --> 23:54.680
It may take an entirely different form to create something that would be comparable.

23:54.680 --> 23:58.680
The second I want to talk about that I think is very important is organizing within the

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
workplace.

23:59.680 --> 24:04.640
You know, I've met many, many, many burnt out free and open source software maintainers

24:04.640 --> 24:08.040
in my life, and I understand the pain there.

24:08.040 --> 24:12.480
And so, you know, our ability to produce what we want requires that we have greater control

24:12.480 --> 24:14.440
over our own labor.

24:14.440 --> 24:21.880
So while technology roles are oftentimes compensated well, at least within certain geographic

24:21.880 --> 24:28.280
areas, it doesn't eliminate our precarity as workers, right?

24:28.280 --> 24:32.920
And I think in particular, many of us are finding that out now.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.640
So in this case, what do we do about it?

24:35.640 --> 24:40.000
Well, historically, the formulation of labor unions have allowed us as workers to better

24:40.000 --> 24:44.480
bargain with our employees and regain control over our labor power.

24:44.480 --> 24:51.040
And I think when thinking about how we can manage to have the time and capacity to be

24:51.040 --> 24:55.800
able to build what we want, thinking about regaining that control within your own workplace,

24:55.800 --> 25:01.040
particularly through labor unions, is a great first step.

25:01.040 --> 25:05.360
The third thing I want to talk about, which is a little touchy, is explicit political

25:05.360 --> 25:09.920
organizing within the context of our free and open source software community.

25:09.920 --> 25:13.880
I don't think we can just build and license the solutions that we want, but rather we

25:13.880 --> 25:19.600
need to organize ourselves along explicit political lines that go beyond that of licensing.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.800
When you think about free and open source software, I was in Bradley Kuhn's talk today

25:23.800 --> 25:27.800
in the legal dev room where he was kind of talking about his personal history in this

25:27.800 --> 25:33.720
case and he talked about how there were a lot of, I forget the word he used, but like

25:33.720 --> 25:38.240
collaborations between groups that had different interests, right?

25:38.240 --> 25:40.560
And he was questioning, he was like, you know, I don't know if we should have worked with

25:40.560 --> 25:42.600
them or worked with someone else.

25:42.600 --> 25:48.160
And I think it's very hard to determine these sort of partnerships that you enter unless

25:48.160 --> 25:54.040
you have a very clear political line that you as a community are agreeing to work together

25:54.040 --> 25:55.040
on.

25:55.040 --> 25:59.240
And I think defining this is really important, probably just as important as something like

25:59.240 --> 26:01.440
the open source definition.

26:01.440 --> 26:08.280
Lastly, you know, I think finding and developing new workplaces is going to be a really important

26:08.280 --> 26:13.560
fact when thinking about, you know, kind of figuring out how we can organize ourselves

26:13.560 --> 26:16.320
to develop the software that we want, right?

26:16.320 --> 26:21.280
I get that this isn't an option for everyone immediately, but, you know, the role of institutions

26:21.280 --> 26:27.280
such as, you know, NGOs, nonprofits and universities have historically been, you know, key creators

26:27.280 --> 26:31.400
of foundational free and open source software infrastructures.

26:31.400 --> 26:36.040
And furthermore, I think we as a community see our ability to represent ourselves lessening

26:36.040 --> 26:37.600
in general, right?

26:37.600 --> 26:42.840
You look at organizations like the Linux Foundation and they pretty much exclusively represent

26:42.840 --> 26:47.000
the interests of their corporate members, that is literally how they're incorporated,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
right?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.280
And they have no public good mandate.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.920
So I would argue that we should organize, agitate and push for these institutions and

26:55.920 --> 27:02.800
our society to support this production to draw power away from firms.

27:02.800 --> 27:09.120
So now this is a bit tongue in cheek, you know, I'm not claiming you should all be communists,

27:09.120 --> 27:15.320
but this is my poorly made rendition of the earlier poster.

27:15.320 --> 27:20.440
I want to wrap up with, you know, free and open source software, you know, I would argue

27:20.440 --> 27:26.820
was largely outmaneuvered due to this lack of cohesion and organization within a specified

27:26.820 --> 27:28.560
political framework.

27:28.560 --> 27:34.160
And so if we do, you know, seek to reorganize ourselves for a new era in free and open source

27:34.160 --> 27:39.920
software, then we should consider how we got here and, you know, see if we can correct

27:39.920 --> 27:42.880
some of those mistakes.

27:42.880 --> 27:47.400
So you know, I want to, this is my second to last slide and I'd like to open it up for

27:47.400 --> 27:50.160
Q&A if that's okay.

27:50.160 --> 27:55.280
But I thought I would leave this here, you know, if you found this stuff interesting,

27:55.280 --> 27:58.040
I like to leave kind of further reading lists.

27:58.040 --> 28:03.220
And so these were some of the primary citations that drove this research for me, but also

28:03.220 --> 28:09.880
I think just were interesting, relevant sort of pieces of written work.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.880
There's a couple of books in here.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.660
I link to them on LibGen if you can't afford them.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.400
You should be able to download the e-book at least.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.320
And yeah, thank you.

28:19.320 --> 28:26.080
I'm Mike, and I'd like to hopefully try and answer any and all questions you might have.

28:26.080 --> 28:38.040
Thank you.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.040
Thank you very much for the talk.

28:40.040 --> 28:45.560
You presented a very interesting table regarding the leading firms for each repository, etc.

28:45.560 --> 28:51.440
So I'm a NixPKG contributor, and it was mentioned that the leading firm was Logic Blocks.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.560
I think it doesn't exist anymore.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.680
So I'm very interested in understanding how you generate such tables, because it's super

28:57.680 --> 28:58.680
interesting.

28:58.680 --> 29:03.920
Also, how do you deal with corporations or firms which are not really firms?

29:03.920 --> 29:08.960
So for example, on the table there was Home Assistant, and the leading firm was Affolter

29:08.960 --> 29:14.640
Engineering, which to the best of my knowledge is 2% which I don't know if you can qualify

29:14.640 --> 29:16.400
this as a firm or not.

29:16.400 --> 29:25.280
What about those repository projects where you have a lot of people which comes from

29:25.280 --> 29:27.320
very different backgrounds?

29:27.320 --> 29:30.640
Yes, that's pretty much it.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.240
So as I understand it, there was a little bit of rattling.

29:34.240 --> 29:39.320
You're kind of asking, so what was the methodology for generating the data that you're showing?

29:39.320 --> 29:40.320
How'd you get it?

29:40.320 --> 29:46.200
So am I able to click on this?

29:46.200 --> 29:51.120
So these tables were generated by the Digital Commons Policy Council as part of a Ford Foundation

29:51.120 --> 29:54.880
Digital Critical Infrastructure Research Grant.

29:54.880 --> 30:00.740
I don't know if I – oh, wow, that is small.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.800
So this is the research grant.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
I don't have Wi-Fi.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.440
That was silly of me.

30:06.440 --> 30:13.960
But essentially, the detail in this report, the exact methodology for doing it, it was

30:13.960 --> 30:18.200
a lot of like we had to deduplicate identities.

30:18.200 --> 30:28.560
We compared emails for frequency commits and mangled it all together into a single report.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.520
But they can detail it pretty well.

30:30.520 --> 30:35.080
I did look over it because I was asking myself the same questions and I was pretty satisfied

30:35.080 --> 30:36.080
with it.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.680
It was a while ago, so I probably would do a poor job of repeating it.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.680
I'm over here.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.680
Hi.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.680
Thanks.

30:43.680 --> 30:49.360
I found that really interesting and very provoking.

30:49.360 --> 30:56.160
An outcome I see a conclusion of this, the idea that free software has become platformized

30:56.160 --> 31:01.880
and has become this sort of substrate, is a sort of two-tier society where we in this

31:01.880 --> 31:07.680
room are a sort of intelligentsia and we have access to these free tools and we get access

31:07.680 --> 31:09.400
to the four freedoms.

31:09.400 --> 31:16.400
We can use free software licensed products and we can study them, share them and improve

31:16.400 --> 31:17.400
them.

31:17.400 --> 31:22.640
Then we build services as a software substitute and everybody else is a kind of London proletariat

31:22.640 --> 31:28.720
who doesn't get those freedoms and doesn't get to sort of benefit in the intellectual

31:28.720 --> 31:31.880
fruits of free software.

31:31.880 --> 31:38.800
Is that necessarily connected to the kind of corporate capture of free and open source

31:38.800 --> 31:41.520
software that you were talking about?

31:41.520 --> 31:48.080
What are the organizational roots or the agitations that we can take to actually extend those

31:48.080 --> 31:53.640
freedoms out beyond the experts and to the people who use computers?

31:53.640 --> 31:54.640
Yeah.

31:54.640 --> 31:59.520
A very big question you asked for sure.

31:59.520 --> 32:05.360
If we imagine the free software community, oftentimes we're very technical people.

32:05.360 --> 32:12.520
Like I use Linux desktop and I'm a social scientist so I would consider myself fairly

32:12.520 --> 32:13.840
non-technical here.

32:13.840 --> 32:21.040
But it allows us to have these sort of freedoms by having this technical knowledge.

32:21.040 --> 32:26.120
Many people, I'm sure many of you have interacted with, maybe don't have that technical knowledge

32:26.120 --> 32:32.400
or that capacity or whatever to sort of interact with free software in the same way and use

32:32.400 --> 32:36.560
it, maybe their job requires that they don't or whatever.

32:36.560 --> 32:45.600
And so does this play a part in sort of figuring out how we can advocate for these ideas to

32:45.600 --> 32:49.840
be more equitable across people?

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
Is that correct?

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
Cool.

32:51.840 --> 33:00.720
So I would argue that for sure as technologists we face unique labor pressures.

33:00.720 --> 33:08.280
In particular, I was at the EU policy forum thing yesterday and there are a lot of policy

33:08.280 --> 33:14.960
people that go up and they're like, technology, the coders are going to save the planet because

33:14.960 --> 33:21.880
they're genius and they kind of, we get a lot of lip service towards our technical ability.

33:21.880 --> 33:28.480
But on the flip side I would argue that we still face many of the same precarities that

33:28.480 --> 33:32.760
people have, that we've seen workers have throughout history.

33:32.760 --> 33:39.080
And for sure it's a struggle and it's a discussion we need to have as we're organizing ourselves.

33:39.080 --> 33:46.680
But I think first and foremost, if we want to have better free and open source software,

33:46.680 --> 33:51.000
we got to have more control over our own labor power to create it.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.640
We've done a lot of really cool stuff just like as hobbyists and things like that.

33:55.640 --> 34:01.800
Imagine if there was an army of us all working together and dictating like, oh, this is what

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
we want.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
I don't want Facebook.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.080
Who likes Facebook anyways?

34:06.080 --> 34:10.200
I want to build the thing that's actually allowing me to connect with people and the

34:10.200 --> 34:13.200
ways that I dictate is best for me.

34:13.200 --> 34:16.520
It takes a lot of organization and agitation to get there.

34:16.520 --> 34:24.760
And I think even as intellectuals or a person in the professional managerial class, we still

34:24.760 --> 34:27.920
have a lot of incentive to work at that.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.000
I hope that answers it.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.520
It's kind of a vague answer.

34:31.520 --> 34:41.200
Yeah, so when open source was being developed in discrete ways for discrete products, there

34:41.200 --> 34:48.320
was no cost to the developers of the software when someone used that software in whatever

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
setting.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.440
So you could produce a thousand or a million and the open source project almost didn't

34:53.440 --> 34:57.600
know who was there and who was using it.

34:57.600 --> 35:04.000
And I understand your concept that there's more of a consumption at the platform level

35:04.000 --> 35:07.600
now than discrete software.

35:07.600 --> 35:17.320
But the question is, how do projects evolve in an environment where you have to provide

35:17.320 --> 35:20.800
now there is now a cost to that platform?

35:20.800 --> 35:25.080
So you've got to have infrastructure, you've got to have networking, you've got to have

35:25.080 --> 35:27.240
admins and so forth.

35:27.240 --> 35:35.480
And there's now a per user cost in a lot of ways to how your software is consumed in a

35:35.480 --> 35:37.560
way that before it was zero cost.

35:37.560 --> 35:43.520
And it feels like that change is pretty significant and does almost open the door or close the

35:43.520 --> 35:51.000
door frankly for pure open source projects to almost operate at scale in that environment.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.280
Yeah, great question.

35:54.280 --> 35:59.920
And very, very relevant and not one I think I have the answer to.

35:59.920 --> 36:08.520
But I want to maybe propose a couple of potential answers that I think I can't choose.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.240
We have to choose.

36:10.240 --> 36:15.320
And so when thinking about platforms, there's a lot of different ways.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.840
Currently many platforms are kind of exploitative.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.600
We don't really have a choice in terms of whether or not we use them if we want to have

36:21.600 --> 36:26.560
access to a certain thing like social networks or whatever.

36:26.560 --> 36:30.720
So part of it's like, oh, maybe we just need to collectively own it.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.800
Maybe just nationalize it.

36:32.800 --> 36:39.000
It's one very political way of thinking about solving this problem.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.120
If we nationalize it, then it's democratically controlled theoretically.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.560
This is one way of approaching this problem of user autonomy.

36:47.560 --> 36:53.800
Then if someone wants to change it, then we have democracy to help facilitate that somehow.

36:53.800 --> 36:59.080
Another way of approaching the problem though is do we need platforms at all?

36:59.080 --> 37:06.680
Is this approach of one specific technological solution to solving one specific need within

37:06.680 --> 37:08.080
our society?

37:08.080 --> 37:11.640
Is this the right way of going about it, or was this just the most effective way of running

37:11.640 --> 37:12.840
it?

37:12.840 --> 37:19.040
Can we imagine futures of which our technology is progressing, but it's still discrete enough

37:19.040 --> 37:21.160
that we can maintain control over it?

37:21.160 --> 37:24.040
And then what does that look like, and how do we get there?

37:24.040 --> 37:32.960
I think these are the different arguments and maybe factions that might arise within

37:32.960 --> 37:34.280
the open source community.

37:34.280 --> 37:40.960
I think if we start begin really rethinking what we're doing on a more fundamental level.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.520
Does that sort of?

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
Yeah.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.520
Thanks.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.520
Hi.

37:46.520 --> 37:53.520
I was wondering what would we see or hear when there's good organization within the

37:53.520 --> 37:54.520
workplace?

37:54.520 --> 38:01.360
And that question is sort of in context of major strikes in the UK at the moment around

38:01.360 --> 38:06.680
a lot of public services, and also in context of a broad post by Carl Mitchell called It's

38:06.680 --> 38:13.560
a Trap, which is basically warning that the union sphere in the US is very heavily legislated,

38:13.560 --> 38:17.960
and there's lots of sort of bad political context when it comes to saying, we should

38:17.960 --> 38:21.840
have a union for this, basically being something that you shouldn't ask for unless you really

38:21.840 --> 38:24.840
know what you're getting into.

38:24.840 --> 38:33.560
So I guess maybe before you hand it off, is your question more on what do we do about

38:33.560 --> 38:38.000
unions kind of being portrayed in a certain way, or is it like as a union applicable?

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I've organized well.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Why do you organize?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
What does that look like?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Yeah.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, that's a great question.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.440
I have a lot of friends, and as part of my research, I do lots of research with how unions

38:50.440 --> 38:55.080
currently organize and how they use technology.

38:55.080 --> 39:02.720
So there's not one... Everyone I talk to, whenever I ask them this question, they're

39:02.720 --> 39:06.640
like, well, I can't give you a blueprint, but I can tell you some things that work for

39:06.640 --> 39:10.640
us.

39:10.640 --> 39:17.320
I work with a couple union organizers at Amazon, and they have huge turnover.

39:17.320 --> 39:23.920
So focusing on new employees as a point of organizing and getting people and educating

39:23.920 --> 39:26.200
them is very important for them.

39:26.200 --> 39:31.880
I have another friend that works as a technician in a hospital who has a very small department.

39:31.880 --> 39:37.120
And when they started focusing on unionizing, or at least collectively bargaining amongst

39:37.120 --> 39:43.520
themselves, they started in a very small but critical part of their organization, saying,

39:43.520 --> 39:45.680
we can't do the whole hospital at once.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.440
We'll just get fired, right?

39:48.440 --> 39:51.680
We'll have a bad time, and it'll be very hard, and we don't have the capacity.

39:51.680 --> 39:57.600
But maybe within our department, if we begin forming certain lines about what we want and

39:57.600 --> 40:02.660
what we care about, we can begin starting our organization from there and then moving

40:02.660 --> 40:05.280
outward if we gain momentum.

40:05.280 --> 40:13.360
I think particularly within the technological context and people within tech companies,

40:13.360 --> 40:17.000
this might be an interesting thing to try out.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.040
But that said, we haven't seen, we don't have a lot to learn from in this sense, right?

40:23.040 --> 40:29.600
There aren't a lot of existing tech company unions, but maybe that's a place to start,

40:29.600 --> 40:31.640
maybe looking at some of the smaller ones.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.400
Or if you work at Amazon, check out Amazon Workers United.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.640
If you're at Google, check out Alphabet Workers United.

40:38.640 --> 40:43.920
There are existing unions within these companies, even if they aren't contract unions.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.600
Thanks for your talk.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.920
This is also related to organization.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
You mentioned software foundations.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.720
Unfortunately, a lot of them have similar structures in business models.

40:56.720 --> 41:03.020
Because I've been thinking about alternatives to software foundation.

41:03.020 --> 41:06.960
Is it that we need to work on a different membership or a different business model or

41:06.960 --> 41:07.960
governance?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.920
I don't have any thoughts on this.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.920
Yeah.

41:10.920 --> 41:11.920
It's a big question.

41:11.920 --> 41:20.800
And certainly, when I hear a lot of folks talking about, I think it's, I would argue,

41:20.800 --> 41:24.920
and I know I called out many companies here, but I would argue the Linux Foundation is

41:24.920 --> 41:29.680
quite different from most open source software foundations.

41:29.680 --> 41:35.520
Linux Foundation is a membership organization that is formed specifically to represent its

41:35.520 --> 41:36.520
corporate members.

41:36.520 --> 41:39.080
They're looking for a membership to get into the Linux Foundation.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.080
They have a summit and stuff like that.

41:42.080 --> 41:47.320
And they're supposed to advocate on your right, on behalf of your interests, as a tech company

41:47.320 --> 41:49.400
that utilizes open source.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.280
They've grown quite a lot due to their funding.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.960
I would argue that's very different from something like the Python Software Foundation or the

41:57.960 --> 42:03.360
Rust Foundation or even Apache or something like that.

42:03.360 --> 42:08.400
I would argue, I would like to see more collaboration.

42:08.400 --> 42:13.280
I don't think software foundations for every project that exist in their own little ecosystem.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.400
I think that's good, so you can receive funding and stuff like that.

42:17.400 --> 42:22.800
But we should start figuring out ways that, what if there was a Linux Foundation that

42:22.800 --> 42:29.560
wasn't driven principally by members who paid for ownership?

42:29.560 --> 42:33.440
Maybe we could think about things like, oh, I know the top contributors might get membership

42:33.440 --> 42:40.080
if you contribute a certain amount or some other form.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.840
There's a lot of different ways that you could go about it.

42:42.840 --> 42:48.280
But I think figuring out how to bring communities together with similar interests, even if they

42:48.280 --> 42:54.480
aren't the same project or in the same tech stack, is important because then you can begin

42:54.480 --> 43:00.440
organizing along ideological lines rather than just like, how do we make Wayland work

43:00.440 --> 43:06.800
better in Nome or something?

43:06.800 --> 43:16.320
I feel like there are a lot of pieces to dismantling these platforms.

43:16.320 --> 43:21.780
I feel like a few of them are being discussed around here, like the cooperative company

43:21.780 --> 43:29.000
structures and building new open platforms.

43:29.000 --> 43:35.960
But when it comes to unionizing, because there aren't really many tech unions, I've been

43:35.960 --> 43:39.160
thinking a lot about how these would work.

43:39.160 --> 43:48.200
And I wondered what your thoughts were on the idea of using tech unions to try and dismantle

43:48.200 --> 43:54.280
some of the existing platforms, like say, we're not going to work on AWS because we

43:54.280 --> 43:57.600
don't agree with Amazon and what it's doing with its other employees, for example.

43:57.600 --> 44:02.840
What are your thoughts on that way of approaching this kind of thing?

44:02.840 --> 44:03.840
Yeah.

44:03.840 --> 44:12.000
I would say one step at a time.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.280
Before giving the talk, obviously I talked about this subject to a lot of people.

44:16.280 --> 44:19.200
And there's a sense of, like, things are pretty bad now.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.160
How are we supposed to deal with all this stuff?

44:21.160 --> 44:22.560
It feels like everything's collapsing.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.600
We're kind of in survival mode.

44:25.600 --> 44:33.480
I would argue, at least right now, at this moment, the real benefit of unionizing within

44:33.480 --> 44:40.600
technology workplaces is it gives a little bit more time and autonomy and stability back

44:40.600 --> 44:43.200
to technology workers.

44:43.200 --> 44:49.800
And so when I think about the crisis and open source around volunteers who are just overburdened

44:49.800 --> 44:54.400
and stuff, and I think about everyone I know that works in tech that's on call all the

44:54.400 --> 45:00.040
time and software services are crashing and now their coworkers are being laid off or

45:00.040 --> 45:08.160
maybe they are, this is the problem that I think if we can claw back some of our own

45:08.160 --> 45:13.920
time, if we can get a little more autonomy on our own, a little more reasonable working

45:13.920 --> 45:20.040
conditions, like even I get that the pay is good in some conditions, then we can begin

45:20.040 --> 45:25.720
just having the head space to think about these new solutions and have the time to organize

45:25.720 --> 45:29.680
with each other where our boss isn't watching us either.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.080
Right?

45:31.080 --> 45:42.440
Thanks for your talk.

45:42.440 --> 45:47.640
You talked about software, but do you think we can observe the same shift from individual

45:47.640 --> 45:56.720
and independent contributors to software companies and big firms paid contributors in the international

45:56.720 --> 46:03.920
standardization organization like IETF, for example, I think about how the first version

46:03.920 --> 46:12.560
of HTTP protocol was defined and the third version which was mostly the result of a bargain

46:12.560 --> 46:15.760
between Google, Facebook and Microsoft.

46:15.760 --> 46:21.680
Is there any data or work on it?

46:21.680 --> 46:22.680
I'm sure there is.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.280
I don't have any.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.560
I have anecdotal data.

46:26.560 --> 46:34.440
I served on a couple IEEE standards committees and noticed this sort of major differentiating

46:34.440 --> 46:39.600
where you get people who are there on developing a standard specifically for the interest of

46:39.600 --> 46:40.600
their company.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.600
Right?

46:41.600 --> 46:48.520
They are like, my boss is paying me and I'm supposed to help manage this and make it so

46:48.520 --> 46:52.280
our organization can accomplish the goals that we want to do.

46:52.280 --> 46:56.320
I'm not saying it's evil to want to do that or anything like that.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.800
I see a lot of that and I don't see a lot of people who are like, I think the standard

47:00.800 --> 47:01.800
is pretty cool.

47:01.800 --> 47:06.480
I did a thing with something related one time and I want to, it's like showing up at your

47:06.480 --> 47:07.480
town hall meeting.

47:07.480 --> 47:12.680
Who has time for that anymore?

47:12.680 --> 47:17.000
I would argue the same principles are at play here.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.320
More and more organizations are interested in forming standards with each other because

47:21.320 --> 47:26.320
it helps share the cost of development of a lot of their infrastructures.

47:26.320 --> 47:30.920
No one wants to reinvent the entire stack for whatever thing they are building.

47:30.920 --> 47:36.160
By utilizing standards, you can more effectively do that the same way that you could by utilizing

47:36.160 --> 47:39.680
open source software to do that.

47:39.680 --> 47:46.280
I would say principally there are a lot of similarities but I don't have like a, I certainly,

47:46.280 --> 47:49.360
at least at this time, I couldn't empirically prove it.

47:49.360 --> 47:55.360
But a great point for further research on the road here.

47:55.360 --> 48:02.360
Right, is that better?

48:02.360 --> 48:03.360
Fascinating talk.

48:03.360 --> 48:09.840
I just wonder whether we've made life easy for the big corporations.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.560
I think we all enjoy writing software.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.560
We enjoy solving a problem.

48:13.560 --> 48:19.040
It's a bit like an academic, researching something and then you get an entrepreneur

48:19.040 --> 48:21.840
making his fortune.

48:21.840 --> 48:25.520
How can we fight back as developers?

48:25.520 --> 48:26.920
Yeah.

48:26.920 --> 48:32.640
So I guess your question is, if I understand correctly, you're kind of like, we kind of

48:32.640 --> 48:35.640
made it easy for us to get into the situation that we are in now.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.320
Like how do we fight back?

48:37.320 --> 48:38.320
Is that it?

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
Yeah.

48:39.320 --> 48:47.760
Well, you know, I think, I'm not a huge fan of like kind of the self-flagellation where

48:47.760 --> 48:51.960
it's like, you know, we got corrupted or whatever.

48:51.960 --> 48:57.960
You know, as the last 50 years of history around, you know, the development of digital

48:57.960 --> 49:01.760
technology has a lot of very major incentives.

49:01.760 --> 49:02.760
It was very complex.

49:02.760 --> 49:08.520
It was not necessarily super obvious that we would be where we are today.

49:08.520 --> 49:13.080
You know, I think the most important thing is like, you know, the future is yours if

49:13.080 --> 49:14.920
you fight for it.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.040
Right?

49:16.040 --> 49:20.320
It's not like an easy, you know, the things I suggested, if you want to try to unionize

49:20.320 --> 49:22.520
your workplace, it's not an easy thing to do.

49:22.520 --> 49:25.880
You know, I have many people that have like tried and failed.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.760
I know many people that have succeeded as well.

49:28.760 --> 49:35.040
But, you know, I think like if this is something you want, right, if you think about like the

49:35.040 --> 49:39.840
four freedoms or these ideals of open source as like user autonomy, you're like, you know,

49:39.840 --> 49:41.080
this is the world I want to live in.

49:41.080 --> 49:46.440
And as a technologist, I can create this stuff, then, you know, like anything, it'll take

49:46.440 --> 49:47.960
work to try to do that.

49:47.960 --> 49:53.960
And it's more about recognizing that and then figuring out what to do next.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.080
I think we're at time to one more question.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.080
Thanks for this.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.840
It's really kind of a great thing.

50:00.840 --> 50:06.800
I want to ask not only you, but everyone else here, you know, do you think that we as humans

50:06.800 --> 50:13.000
can step away from that kind of that you always need to have someone like in charge?

50:13.000 --> 50:19.920
So we have that, you know, pyramidal kind of thing and that to like to go more, you

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
know, a flat.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.560
So that's what I'm saying.

50:22.560 --> 50:29.360
So we are so used to have someone in charge and to someone, as you said, word that I don't

50:29.360 --> 50:35.800
like a lot, I can dictate to someone and dictate what you should do and actually team up.

50:35.800 --> 50:40.320
I'm not sure that we as humans really can do that on some bigger scale.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.320
It's a left.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.560
I'm very left, but I don't go far left.

50:44.560 --> 50:46.800
So I am really left side.

50:46.800 --> 50:52.040
So I'm saying that it's kind of feels like if you play in a small band and you make a

50:52.040 --> 50:54.400
nice songs and, you know, with music.

50:54.400 --> 51:00.000
And as soon as you get my mind there, you sell your soul and you're gone.

51:00.000 --> 51:06.160
So how we can go more flat without losing our soul.

51:06.160 --> 51:12.960
Yeah, I mean, it's tricky, you know, the human nature and eating someone in charge.

51:12.960 --> 51:17.200
This is a little bit of a joke here, but like, you know, I would love to introduce you to

51:17.200 --> 51:18.840
my four year old nephew.

51:18.840 --> 51:24.800
He would he might have you changing your thoughts on that very quickly with respecting authority

51:24.800 --> 51:27.840
and wanting that.

51:27.840 --> 51:33.440
I think there's no easy question about like, but you have to think about our organization

51:33.440 --> 51:35.480
scientifically, right?

51:35.480 --> 51:40.400
I don't think it's like a matter of preference, but we have to think about our relationships

51:40.400 --> 51:41.400
to each other.

51:41.400 --> 51:47.080
We have to test and evaluate various modes of organization and we have to approach it

51:47.080 --> 51:50.040
like any other difficult scientific problem in our lifetime.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.760
And, you know, through that, hopefully we can find a better solution if not the right

51:53.760 --> 51:54.760
one.

51:54.760 --> 51:55.760
Thank you.

51:55.760 --> 51:58.040
My many thanks for the amazing talk.
