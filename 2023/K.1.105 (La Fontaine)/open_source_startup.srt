0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.120
Hey, everyone. My name is Tom, and today I'll be talking to you about starting an open source

2
0:00:11.120 --> 0:00:17.800
startup. So about this talk, it's directed at early stage startups or people thinking

3
0:00:17.800 --> 0:00:22.360
about starting one with an open source product or people thinking about open sourcing the

4
0:00:22.360 --> 0:00:26.420
existing product. If you were here for the previous talk, it was more about the step

5
0:00:26.420 --> 0:00:29.960
one to step two. Here I'm going to talk about zero to one. You don't have a product yet,

6
0:00:29.960 --> 0:00:37.160
you're just starting out. So what is an early stage startup? For the purpose of this talk,

7
0:00:37.160 --> 0:00:42.600
it's an early stage company that's designed to grow fast, open backed by venture capitalists,

8
0:00:42.600 --> 0:00:49.760
so investors, and aiming for very high revenue. You have to remember, and maybe it's important

9
0:00:49.760 --> 0:00:54.400
to frame the rest of the talk around this, is that this is a capitalistic endeavor. You're

10
0:00:54.400 --> 0:00:58.560
taking money from people and you're promising them to return them more money after a certain

11
0:00:58.560 --> 0:01:02.600
amount of time. You have to remember that all throughout things. It's something that's

12
0:01:02.600 --> 0:01:07.440
so easy to forget, but that's the basis for everything else. It's especially easy for

13
0:01:07.440 --> 0:01:11.800
us to forget because we're so used to giving so much free value to the world with our open

14
0:01:11.800 --> 0:01:15.680
source contribution, and also taking a lot of free value back by using Linux, by using

15
0:01:15.680 --> 0:01:20.240
KDE, by using all of these tools. But if you're out there building a business, taking money

16
0:01:20.240 --> 0:01:25.960
from investors, that's something that's important to remember. So who am I? I'm the founder

17
0:01:25.960 --> 0:01:30.920
and CEO of Zwix. It's a company we started as a business and then open sourced a product,

18
0:01:30.920 --> 0:01:35.480
although that was the intention from the beginning, and also created Ettasync that started as

19
0:01:35.480 --> 0:01:40.760
an open source project and then turned into a business. I'm obsessed with API, developer

20
0:01:40.760 --> 0:01:46.480
tools, been around for a while, worked on Enlightenment, OpenMoco, and a few other projects

21
0:01:46.480 --> 0:01:52.280
as well. So what is Zwix? We do webhook sending as a service. It's an API-first developer

22
0:01:52.280 --> 0:01:57.680
tool. We have companies send webhooks essentially. It's both open core, hand and host a product,

23
0:01:57.680 --> 0:02:02.480
as we do both. We raise over $10 million from top investors, including Y Combinator and

24
0:02:02.480 --> 0:02:10.080
Tristan Horowitz, Adaf, and founders and CTOs of companies such as GitHub, Page

25
0:02:10.080 --> 0:02:13.720
Entity Segment, Lookout, and Flite.io. So why am I even giving this talk? So there are

26
0:02:13.720 --> 0:02:17.800
a lot of resources for how to start a startup online, a lot of great resources, but there

27
0:02:17.800 --> 0:02:23.040
aren't a lot of resources for open source startups, especially not ones that come from

28
0:02:23.040 --> 0:02:26.440
the community, from people that actually understand open source. It's more like an opportunistic

29
0:02:26.440 --> 0:02:30.920
approach that a lot of people take. And also a lot of people have been asking me for advice

30
0:02:30.920 --> 0:02:39.000
over the years, even this weekend, as I figured, why not? Let's make a deck out of it. So before

31
0:02:39.000 --> 0:02:44.160
we begin, why even start a startup? I saw a talk by one of the co-founders of Facebook

32
0:02:44.160 --> 0:02:47.920
many years ago, and it really resonated with me, especially now that I've seen other people

33
0:02:47.920 --> 0:02:52.720
start companies, have started companies myself. And a lot of people think it's cool. You know,

34
0:02:52.720 --> 0:02:55.720
your vision is that you're going to hit launch, you just finished building a product, you

35
0:02:55.720 --> 0:02:59.160
got to press attention, you know, go wakeboarding with Obama, I don't know what you want to

36
0:02:59.160 --> 0:03:03.760
do, rock star. But the reality is that no one is actually going to care at all. You're

37
0:03:03.760 --> 0:03:06.760
going to beg them for press attention, you're going to beg customers to use your shitty

38
0:03:06.760 --> 0:03:10.760
product and really, honestly, you don't have time for press and all of the rock star stuff

39
0:03:10.760 --> 0:03:15.400
anyway. You're building a business. And also a lot of people think that they want to be

40
0:03:15.400 --> 0:03:19.480
the boss. You know, big office, private steam room, make a billion dollar deals, private

41
0:03:19.480 --> 0:03:23.600
jets, all of that stuff. In reality, it's a noisy co-working space if you're lucky,

42
0:03:23.600 --> 0:03:27.520
most likely your kitchen counter. And begging people to try a product again and fighting

43
0:03:27.520 --> 0:03:33.040
for survival. So it's really not that, it's not that what you think. Another thing people

44
0:03:33.040 --> 0:03:37.880
think, well, I'm my own boss, I'm going to have flexibility. I love this quote. As an

45
0:03:37.880 --> 0:03:41.800
entrepreneur, you get some flexibility, you get to choose which 24 hours of the day work

46
0:03:41.800 --> 0:03:46.920
on. It's so true. And for a variety of reasons. First of all, your customers are demanding

47
0:03:46.920 --> 0:03:50.060
and you want to make sure that they're served right. You don't want to lose that deal just

48
0:03:50.060 --> 0:03:55.280
because you're unavailable, even though it's your wife's birthday or some other occasion.

49
0:03:55.280 --> 0:03:58.120
And the other reason is you're really obsessed with what you're building. So you're actually

50
0:03:58.120 --> 0:04:01.400
thinking about it all the time anyway. And you have ideas in the shower and you have

51
0:04:01.400 --> 0:04:05.400
ideas during dinner and you're just dying to go back and kind of like put that into

52
0:04:05.400 --> 0:04:11.360
reality. Another bad reason is that you want to have more impact. Honestly, just join an

53
0:04:11.360 --> 0:04:14.920
early stage start-up. You're going to be working on a product that's already well-funded, doing

54
0:04:14.920 --> 0:04:20.680
well. You're going to grow with the team, become the CTO maybe. It's a great path. Or

55
0:04:20.680 --> 0:04:26.640
a late stage company. I worked at Samsung. My code is being used by millions and millions

56
0:04:26.640 --> 0:04:30.640
of people, or at least devices. That's much more impact than any of my companies have

57
0:04:30.640 --> 0:04:36.200
reached so far. So that's just something to keep in mind. Another thing, you want to get

58
0:04:36.200 --> 0:04:41.640
rich. That's not a good reason because the likelihood of success is very low. You're

59
0:04:41.640 --> 0:04:45.560
most likely going to have a really low salary for many years and then you're going to go

60
0:04:45.560 --> 0:04:50.680
bust. Not a good strategy if you want to make money. Again, join an early stage start-up.

61
0:04:50.680 --> 0:04:56.800
April 50 at Facebook, for example, is a multi, multi, multi-millionaire. Or just work at

62
0:04:56.800 --> 0:05:00.680
Facebook, Google, all of those companies. Again, I don't recommend, but if this is what

63
0:05:00.680 --> 0:05:04.920
you want and you're just chasing money, you can do that. And you have to remember it's

64
0:05:04.920 --> 0:05:09.680
going to be absolutely brutal. So things are going to go wrong. Deals are going to fall

65
0:05:09.680 --> 0:05:12.880
through. You're going to get a lot of no's from candidates, from investors, from literally

66
0:05:12.880 --> 0:05:17.000
everyone all the time. You're going to want to quit. But because you're the founder, that

67
0:05:17.000 --> 0:05:20.360
means that if you quit, the company is going to close. And that means your employees are

68
0:05:20.360 --> 0:05:23.000
going to lose their job and your investors are going to lose the money invested. So you're

69
0:05:23.000 --> 0:05:27.000
going to really like, it's really hard to quit as a founder.

70
0:05:27.000 --> 0:05:31.920
Okay, so we covered all the budget stuff. So why actually start a start-up? And there

71
0:05:31.920 --> 0:05:35.960
are a few good reasons. One, you really care about the problem. You want to cure cancer.

72
0:05:35.960 --> 0:05:40.480
No one else has cracked it yet. You think you have a shot? Go for it. You're really

73
0:05:40.480 --> 0:05:44.600
passionate about your idea. You have, I don't know, Uber for cats. Terrible idea. But this

74
0:05:44.600 --> 0:05:48.720
is something that you really care about. And you want to get, you know, because everyone

75
0:05:48.720 --> 0:05:52.360
thinks it's terrible, I guess, for the laughs, no one else is going to build it. You decide

76
0:05:52.360 --> 0:05:57.160
to build it yourself. And you just want to start maybe your own company. You just, I

77
0:05:57.160 --> 0:06:01.600
don't know, whatever reason, this is what you want to do. Just make sure that your motivation

78
0:06:01.600 --> 0:06:06.360
is long-lasting because you're going to need it for the next ten years.

79
0:06:06.360 --> 0:06:10.120
Another good reason, a bit more altruistic, is that open-source start-ups are good for

80
0:06:10.120 --> 0:06:15.800
the community. Much more money and talent into open-source, great open-source products.

81
0:06:15.800 --> 0:06:20.440
We all going to use them every day. And also, open-source start-ups tend to support the

82
0:06:20.440 --> 0:06:24.800
rest of the community. We support other projects both financially and by upstreaming patches.

83
0:06:24.800 --> 0:06:30.940
We also employ the maintainer of, like, Redis Rust. And, again, great for the ecosystem.

84
0:06:30.940 --> 0:06:34.400
But you have to remember, there are other alternatives. You can join a promising start-up.

85
0:06:34.400 --> 0:06:39.720
You can start a non-VC backed start-up. Much less of the stress that I mentioned. You can

86
0:06:39.720 --> 0:06:43.960
start a side business. I've done that. It's great. Much less stressful. Still stressful,

87
0:06:43.960 --> 0:06:48.600
but much less. Or you can just start an open-source project. Again, I've done that. Many people

88
0:06:48.600 --> 0:06:52.840
in this room have done it as well. It's a great way to just put something out there

89
0:06:52.840 --> 0:06:57.560
without the pressure of actually having returns. So really just be true to yourself of what

90
0:06:57.560 --> 0:07:03.240
you want, because you need to know what you're signing up for.

91
0:07:03.240 --> 0:07:07.840
So let's talk about getting started. The first step in the journey is validating your idea.

92
0:07:07.840 --> 0:07:11.840
So is this a problem that people even care about? Are you the right team to build it?

93
0:07:11.840 --> 0:07:15.000
How will you make money? How will you get customers? How big is the opportunity? You

94
0:07:15.000 --> 0:07:19.060
need to constantly validate your riskiest assumptions in order to not go head-on the

95
0:07:19.060 --> 0:07:23.640
wrong direction. I highly recommend filling in the Y Combinator application. Y Combinator

96
0:07:23.640 --> 0:07:30.200
is an accelerator. Even if you don't submit it, it just forces you to think very thoroughly

97
0:07:30.200 --> 0:07:33.560
about the business from the eyes of investors and from a business perspective. And it's

98
0:07:33.560 --> 0:07:37.400
been very helpful for me.

99
0:07:37.400 --> 0:07:43.960
You know how people say there are no bad ideas? There are definitely bad ideas. Some threads

100
0:07:43.960 --> 0:07:50.520
of common bad ideas are the ones that are very obvious. So for example, oh, I'm going

101
0:07:50.520 --> 0:07:55.200
to start a startup for teleportation. Great idea. I'm sure all of you guys are going to

102
0:07:55.200 --> 0:07:59.360
pay instead of taking the flight back home. But the problem is it's actually technically

103
0:07:59.360 --> 0:08:05.200
difficult or impossible. That's why no one has started it. So it's the first step of

104
0:08:05.200 --> 0:08:06.440
validation.

105
0:08:06.440 --> 0:08:10.360
The other type of ideas is when you have a solution, you built a project, you're really

106
0:08:10.360 --> 0:08:14.600
excited by it. That's what you want to work on. Problem is it's not applicable to everything.

107
0:08:14.600 --> 0:08:18.440
I don't have a good example from the top of my head, but there are many of them. And I'm

108
0:08:18.440 --> 0:08:26.920
sure the more crypto, God haters, we'll use the cryptos as an example for that.

109
0:08:26.920 --> 0:08:34.440
Also another one, I get pitched a lot of ideas about spaces that the 2B founders know nothing

110
0:08:34.440 --> 0:08:39.920
about. I know nothing about cancer research. I'm not going to start a cancer research company.

111
0:08:39.920 --> 0:08:43.880
And one last thing which is actually not a bad signal, people telling you that it's bad.

112
0:08:43.880 --> 0:08:48.240
That's going back to why it doesn't exist because everyone thinks it's bad. And that's

113
0:08:48.240 --> 0:08:53.120
where your opportunity lies. So just ignore the naysayers.

114
0:08:53.120 --> 0:08:59.800
I asked Paul, the cofounder and CEO of Superbase, what is his best advice? And he said everything

115
0:08:59.800 --> 0:09:03.400
should be open source, but not every open source should be a business. And that's so

116
0:09:03.400 --> 0:09:09.800
true. Again, validate, verify what you're building is actually a good business.

117
0:09:09.800 --> 0:09:14.560
In the now immortal words of Y Combinator, you need to make something that people want.

118
0:09:14.560 --> 0:09:20.440
That's it. So when you start, all you need to be focusing on is writing code, showing

119
0:09:20.440 --> 0:09:24.720
it to customers, getting feedback, talking to them, all of that. In the open source world,

120
0:09:24.720 --> 0:09:29.760
we release early, release often. That's how you get things to the hands of customers or

121
0:09:29.760 --> 0:09:34.280
users and you get feedback. It's much better to find a few that really love what you're

122
0:09:34.280 --> 0:09:39.680
doing than many people that are, because the few that love, really love it, are going to

123
0:09:39.680 --> 0:09:43.240
tell their friends about it. And the few that are okay about it are going to stop using

124
0:09:43.240 --> 0:09:49.720
it after a certain period of time. Also, 90-10 solution. So find how you make the most impact

125
0:09:49.720 --> 0:09:54.120
with the less amount of time. Like perfection is really the enemy of good here.

126
0:09:54.120 --> 0:09:58.960
And the last thing, you want to do things that don't scale. So what do I mean by that?

127
0:09:58.960 --> 0:10:02.360
There are certain activities that you can do at this stage of the company that are definitely

128
0:10:02.360 --> 0:10:06.600
not going to work once you have a billion users. But for now, you can do them. So one

129
0:10:06.600 --> 0:10:13.520
example from the beginning of Svix is that I used to send the API keys encrypted to our

130
0:10:13.520 --> 0:10:17.080
customers. We didn't have a sign-up flow. There was no need, right? I don't know if

131
0:10:17.080 --> 0:10:21.120
even anyone wants the company or wants the product. So why build the sign-up role? Why

132
0:10:21.120 --> 0:10:24.840
build the landing page? None of these things matter in the beginning. So just focus on

133
0:10:24.840 --> 0:10:29.160
the product. Another great quote that I love is from Steve

134
0:10:29.160 --> 0:10:34.080
Jobs. So everything around you that you call life was made by people that were no smarter

135
0:10:34.080 --> 0:10:38.400
than you are. And you can change it, you can influence it, and you can build your own things

136
0:10:38.400 --> 0:10:42.720
that other people can use. So it's really don't be scared because it looks, you know,

137
0:10:42.720 --> 0:10:48.160
it seems difficult. Just like go for it. Really just go for it.

138
0:10:48.160 --> 0:10:52.920
So before you start, ignore the naysayers, but be honest with yourself. You know, a lot

139
0:10:52.920 --> 0:10:56.400
of people are going to tell you what you're doing is stupid, silly, bad decision. Maybe

140
0:10:56.400 --> 0:11:01.880
they're right. You have to make that call. Effort counts for nothing. This is not school.

141
0:11:01.880 --> 0:11:05.320
If you don't get results, it doesn't matter how hard you work. It doesn't matter how much

142
0:11:05.320 --> 0:11:09.040
you tried. It doesn't matter how cool your code is. It just doesn't matter.

143
0:11:09.040 --> 0:11:14.000
Again, de-risk the business. You have to listen to advice but decide for yourself. First of

144
0:11:14.000 --> 0:11:17.720
all, it's because it's practice for later stages. You're the only one running this company.

145
0:11:17.720 --> 0:11:21.160
But also, you're the only one with a lot of context about what your customers want because

146
0:11:21.160 --> 0:11:23.760
you've been talking to them all the time. And what doesn't work because you've been

147
0:11:23.760 --> 0:11:28.240
writing the code. So really just decide for yourself. And remember that most startups

148
0:11:28.240 --> 0:11:32.920
fail. Like the vast majority. So if you're doing average input, you're going to get average

149
0:11:32.920 --> 0:11:38.040
output and that means death for a startup. So definitely watch out for that.

150
0:11:38.040 --> 0:11:43.000
Okay. I think that was like the beginning. Now we can talk a bit about the product. So

151
0:11:43.000 --> 0:11:48.280
the first and most important thing is understanding the problem. You need to know your customers,

152
0:11:48.280 --> 0:11:52.240
what they want, what they care about, what they hate. You really have the curiosity of

153
0:11:52.240 --> 0:11:57.080
a child and really get to have as most empathy as you can. A good hack in the beginning is

154
0:11:57.080 --> 0:12:00.920
being your own customer. That really works. But you also have to make sure that there's

155
0:12:00.920 --> 0:12:04.600
a path to other customers that are different than you are. Because if you're just building

156
0:12:04.600 --> 0:12:09.240
a name tag that just says the name Tom on them, that's great. But there's just so many

157
0:12:09.240 --> 0:12:13.760
Tom's in the world. I don't think it's a good business.

158
0:12:13.760 --> 0:12:17.840
Another quote, I love quotes, is from Henry Ford. It's asked people what I wanted. They

159
0:12:17.840 --> 0:12:24.120
would have asked for a faster horse. And that means don't, you know, listen to your customers,

160
0:12:24.120 --> 0:12:28.200
learn about their needs and wants, but don't follow blindly. Say no. It's absolutely fine

161
0:12:28.200 --> 0:12:33.920
to say no. You also have to remember it's about what you do. It's not about what you

162
0:12:33.920 --> 0:12:38.000
do, sorry. It's about what you enable. So people don't actually care about drills. I

163
0:12:38.000 --> 0:12:41.840
mean, drills are fun. Don't get me wrong. But what they want is holes. And you have

164
0:12:41.840 --> 0:12:46.000
to figure out how you give them a hole. And again, don't obsess on the fact that you already

165
0:12:46.000 --> 0:12:52.440
have a drill. And another part about this, as you know, we talked about product. And

166
0:12:52.440 --> 0:12:57.840
that kind of implies, you know, what people actually use. But really, when I asked James

167
0:12:57.840 --> 0:13:01.480
about his experience, he said something that really resonated, which is your old company

168
0:13:01.480 --> 0:13:08.000
is the product. And actually, Zeno also concurred. And from my own experience, like, it's I've

169
0:13:08.000 --> 0:13:11.880
lost count the amount of products that I really wanted to try. And I went to their website

170
0:13:11.880 --> 0:13:14.400
and I couldn't understand really what they're doing. But I thought maybe it's relevant.

171
0:13:14.400 --> 0:13:18.120
And I went to their docs, couldn't understand how to get it started, and just dropped off,

172
0:13:18.120 --> 0:13:21.520
even though I'm sure it's actually the perfect product for me. And it's the same with every

173
0:13:21.520 --> 0:13:28.020
other aspect. So, you know, like, marketing, customer success, all of those kind of things.

174
0:13:28.020 --> 0:13:32.640
You have to obsess with a customer experience. So obviously have great customer service,

175
0:13:32.640 --> 0:13:36.480
as I mentioned, you know, your wife's birthday, but the customer is calling, you may need

176
0:13:36.480 --> 0:13:40.960
to like drop for a few minutes. And but much better than having a great customer service

177
0:13:40.960 --> 0:13:45.440
is actually fixing the docs. Like, why do they even have a problem in the first place?

178
0:13:45.440 --> 0:13:49.720
But even better than fixing the docs is just make the product easy to use. So, you know,

179
0:13:49.720 --> 0:13:54.600
same defaults, great onboarding in the product itself. And all of those things make for a

180
0:13:54.600 --> 0:13:59.000
much better experience. Now, I know this doesn't need repeating and

181
0:13:59.000 --> 0:14:01.860
fostering them, you know, just like looking in this room or looking even outside with

182
0:14:01.860 --> 0:14:06.120
all the stands that the amazing communities that are powering, you know, this whole event,

183
0:14:06.120 --> 0:14:09.360
but maintaining a healthy community really matters for an open source project, because

184
0:14:09.360 --> 0:14:11.960
that's how you get contributors, that's how you get evangelism, that's how you get all

185
0:14:11.960 --> 0:14:18.800
of those things that later on turn into business goals. As I said, capitalistic talk. I'm not

186
0:14:18.800 --> 0:14:22.400
as cynical in real life, but I'm just like trying just showing you the connections to

187
0:14:22.400 --> 0:14:27.000
business value. And so be quick to respond to PRs. The most

188
0:14:27.000 --> 0:14:31.360
annoying thing I opened a PR like two years ago, got a got feedback a few months ago,

189
0:14:31.360 --> 0:14:36.280
obviously never fixed the feedback. I mean, that's ridiculous. There are tools to help

190
0:14:36.280 --> 0:14:40.320
to make sure that you maintain a good community like orbit love and also the community dev

191
0:14:40.320 --> 0:14:45.120
room here at Fostom. Okay. So we talked about a product which maybe

192
0:14:45.120 --> 0:14:48.960
some of you know, maybe some of you already built a successful open source project. But

193
0:14:48.960 --> 0:14:52.040
now the you know, what now what we need to remember is that we're actually building a

194
0:14:52.040 --> 0:14:57.720
business. And we're no longer just engineers. And we should focus our time on non-engineering

195
0:14:57.720 --> 0:15:01.520
tasks, which is so hard. And I'm going to talk about that in a boat in a bit. But the

196
0:15:01.520 --> 0:15:06.520
first step is understanding your business model. And what is a business model is just

197
0:15:06.520 --> 0:15:10.740
a fancy way of saying how are you actually going to make money? There are many different

198
0:15:10.740 --> 0:15:15.080
models for open source and many different models for non open source. You know, Red

199
0:15:15.080 --> 0:15:19.720
Hat and canonical and they're a great example of selling additional services. So training,

200
0:15:19.720 --> 0:15:26.540
support, consulting, packaging, so like packages literally. And another example is open core.

201
0:15:26.540 --> 0:15:30.660
So you release some of the source code as open source and then proprietary stuff on

202
0:15:30.660 --> 0:15:37.400
top. GitLab and Redis both do it. Again, very common. Dual licensing, Suqute and FreeBaidai

203
0:15:37.400 --> 0:15:42.160
do it. So you have licensed your code as copy left or something that is not compatible with

204
0:15:42.160 --> 0:15:45.920
some companies. And then they pay you an extra fee to kind of like unlock it and get an enterprise

205
0:15:45.920 --> 0:15:53.120
contract. And then you have managed cloud, SaaS, oftentimes goes hand in hand with open

206
0:15:53.120 --> 0:16:00.400
core when you have the features only in the SaaS product and again for the enterprise.

207
0:16:00.400 --> 0:16:05.120
But MongoDB both do it. You can either run a multi-tenant SaaS or you can just run the

208
0:16:05.120 --> 0:16:10.720
product for them. And there was a time that open core was the way to go and then SaaS

209
0:16:10.720 --> 0:16:14.520
became the way to go because, you know, the advent of the cloud. And actually open core

210
0:16:14.520 --> 0:16:18.520
is getting some traction again because a lot of people want to sell phones, you know, with

211
0:16:18.520 --> 0:16:23.160
GDPR, with data sovereignty, all of those kind of things. People are looking to sell

212
0:16:23.160 --> 0:16:29.440
phones again. And then another one that's not often talked about is supporting products

213
0:16:29.440 --> 0:16:33.280
and services. So that's kind of like similar to open core. But you're not actually extending

214
0:16:33.280 --> 0:16:38.240
the product but you're providing services on top of it. So good examples are GitHub.

215
0:16:38.240 --> 0:16:41.920
GitHub is open source. GitHub has nothing to do with open source. But they're riding on

216
0:16:41.920 --> 0:16:47.160
the Git success. And Android, Google is selling services over an operating system that was

217
0:16:47.160 --> 0:16:55.280
open and can be customizable by many of the, you know, but all the other phone manufacturers.

218
0:16:55.280 --> 0:16:59.560
You can also combine multiple models. But you should know what your main driver is.

219
0:16:59.560 --> 0:17:03.920
You're an early stage start-up. You probably have like one person or more likely 0.1 person

220
0:17:03.920 --> 0:17:08.280
like working on this stuff. So you really need to focus and see what's the main driver

221
0:17:08.280 --> 0:17:12.880
for you. And now because you're building a billion-dollar business, you're going to have

222
0:17:12.880 --> 0:17:17.200
a lot of competition. Other people are going to see your success, are going to see your

223
0:17:17.200 --> 0:17:23.280
opportunity. We have numerous copycats that have launched since we started. And you have

224
0:17:23.280 --> 0:17:27.680
to figure out how do you protect yourself. So there are a few common ways for open source

225
0:17:27.680 --> 0:17:34.040
projects. One way is the license, obviously. I'm sure those need no introduction here.

226
0:17:34.040 --> 0:17:40.120
Copy left, so GPL. The problem with those is that oftentimes they're not liked by enterprise

227
0:17:40.120 --> 0:17:45.280
lawyers. So it's really hard to sell to an enterprise if GPL is just banned from that

228
0:17:45.280 --> 0:17:49.440
enterprise. So that's something to watch out for. Then you have the permissive ones, which

229
0:17:49.440 --> 0:17:54.200
is what we chose, but they don't provide any protection. And then you have the non-free

230
0:17:54.200 --> 0:18:00.440
or fopen, obviously not open source. I understand where they're coming from. Like, seeing AWS

231
0:18:00.440 --> 0:18:05.280
just take your business, host it, and then take all of your revenue stream probably is

232
0:18:05.280 --> 0:18:08.960
not fun. I don't know what I would have done in that situation, but it's definitely...

233
0:18:08.960 --> 0:18:14.360
I can see how there's going to be more innovation in the licensing space just following the

234
0:18:14.360 --> 0:18:20.640
mega cloud companies. And the last one is usually... It's like CLA is usually tied with

235
0:18:20.640 --> 0:18:24.240
a copyright assignment. And then when you do do a licensing, you need to actually own

236
0:18:24.240 --> 0:18:31.480
the copyright. So contributors assign the copyright to you, and then you can re-license.

237
0:18:31.480 --> 0:18:37.400
If I asked multiple lawyers and founders, and almost all of them said, own the trademark,

238
0:18:37.400 --> 0:18:42.160
your license is probably too liberal to protect you. And the trademark is the reason why Mozilla

239
0:18:42.160 --> 0:18:48.200
can say, well, you know, like, can prevent a competitor from starting Firefox++ or Firefox

240
0:18:48.200 --> 0:18:51.760
Remix, all of those kind of things, because that is actually confusing to customers. And

241
0:18:51.760 --> 0:18:57.280
that's a good line of defense. I think like a few years ago, the founder of OwnCloud actually

242
0:18:57.280 --> 0:19:01.800
gave a talk here at Forstem, and he mentioned that they never had the trademark for OwnCloud,

243
0:19:01.800 --> 0:19:06.880
and that prevented them from actually offering a good hosted service, because there were

244
0:19:06.880 --> 0:19:12.760
so many clones, and there were so many people that claimed to be the official one, and it

245
0:19:12.760 --> 0:19:18.920
was like really hard for them to actually maintain control. Another one is network effects

246
0:19:18.920 --> 0:19:23.800
and ecosystem. So if you look at GitLab or even GitHub, even though it's not open source,

247
0:19:23.800 --> 0:19:27.280
just because everyone is there, that means the new projects are going to be hosted there

248
0:19:27.280 --> 0:19:33.840
as well. That's it. It's really tough to break. But even without a SaaS component, just think

249
0:19:33.840 --> 0:19:38.360
about Postgres. There's so many libraries for Postgres and so many utilities for Postgres

250
0:19:38.360 --> 0:19:43.840
across many languages and across many, like, the ecosystem is vast, so it's really hard

251
0:19:43.840 --> 0:19:49.800
to append Postgres from like where they are. So that's like, again, another good line of

252
0:19:49.800 --> 0:19:56.200
defense. Also remember, you know, plans are worthless. Everything is going to change. You're

253
0:19:56.200 --> 0:19:59.920
going to change your assumption. Everything, it's really in flux. Like, it's hard to understand

254
0:19:59.920 --> 0:20:06.200
like how much things, sorry, how to explain how many things change on a single day. But

255
0:20:06.200 --> 0:20:10.680
actually the process of planning is extremely valuable. You know, I'm going to say a word

256
0:20:10.680 --> 0:20:15.040
that probably sounds scary, which is like financial modeling, but it's really you just

257
0:20:15.040 --> 0:20:19.400
go and download a spreadsheet, fill a few values, change like it to, you know, to whatever

258
0:20:19.400 --> 0:20:23.480
you need, and that will provide you a lot of insight into the levers that actually move

259
0:20:23.480 --> 0:20:28.080
your business. So if, for example, you want to charge people $5 and you think you're going

260
0:20:28.080 --> 0:20:33.440
to be able to reach 2,000 customers, that means that you're going to make $10,000 a

261
0:20:33.440 --> 0:20:37.880
month. Maybe enough for you, maybe not enough to sustain a business, but now you know, maybe

262
0:20:37.880 --> 0:20:41.840
you need to increase the price or maybe you need to have a different business model. So

263
0:20:41.840 --> 0:20:46.840
really just the process of planning is extremely valuable. Now that you know the plan, you

264
0:20:46.840 --> 0:20:49.960
kind of know how you're going to make money, it's very important to assess the business

265
0:20:49.960 --> 0:20:56.160
opportunity. One common wrong way to do it is to say, well, you know, the software industry

266
0:20:56.160 --> 0:21:01.040
is vast, it's $1 trillion. If we do really well, Microsoft has 5% of it, if we do really

267
0:21:01.040 --> 0:21:05.960
well, we can go to 1%, and that's a lot of money. Realistically, that just doesn't make

268
0:21:05.960 --> 0:21:10.520
sense, and there's like so many variables that are hidden here that, you know, it just

269
0:21:10.520 --> 0:21:16.280
doesn't add any insights. Like the much better way to do it is bottoms up analysis. So it's

270
0:21:16.280 --> 0:21:19.840
essentially you saying, well, you know, we make $5 out of each customer. I think we can

271
0:21:19.840 --> 0:21:24.040
get to a million customers next year, and then 5 million five years after, and then

272
0:21:24.040 --> 0:21:27.880
100 million 10 years after. And you're probably not going to hit 100 million or probably going

273
0:21:27.880 --> 0:21:31.480
to change some stuff in the business, that's fine. But just understanding that where you're

274
0:21:31.480 --> 0:21:36.520
heading is a $500 million a year business, that already gives you enough of context and

275
0:21:36.520 --> 0:21:40.560
like gives you investors enough context to know what it is, you know, what kind of business

276
0:21:40.560 --> 0:21:46.120
that you have. It's also important to ask, are you really selling $2 for $1? Like is

277
0:21:46.120 --> 0:21:51.280
your business model is like a losing model? So those are a bit more advanced questions.

278
0:21:51.280 --> 0:21:53.720
It's better to just do the market sizing in the beginning, but that's just something to

279
0:21:53.720 --> 0:22:00.200
keep in mind. And when asked here from Cal.com, like the open source, I don't know if you

280
0:22:00.200 --> 0:22:05.240
know this one. And his top advice, he said that as an open source startup, you actually

281
0:22:05.240 --> 0:22:12.320
need a 10x TAM. TAM is total addressable market. So like the what I said in 10 years, 100 million.

282
0:22:12.320 --> 0:22:16.760
And what he was saying by that is, you know, you're cannibalizing your own business. If

283
0:22:16.760 --> 0:22:20.000
you have a successful open source project, people are going to self-host it, but at least

284
0:22:20.000 --> 0:22:25.480
I hope. And that means that you're competing with, you know, the most formidable competitor.

285
0:22:25.480 --> 0:22:29.880
They're always going to be at least as good as you are. And you're going to lose, right?

286
0:22:29.880 --> 0:22:32.800
So you have to understand that some people are not going to buy the, you know, the extra

287
0:22:32.800 --> 0:22:39.120
paid product. And that's important to keep in mind. I asked Nick from QuestDB, like his

288
0:22:39.120 --> 0:22:44.000
perspective, and for them, they're delaying monetization, actually not charging money.

289
0:22:44.000 --> 0:22:47.320
And that I know, like the reason why I wanted to highlight this one is that that's often

290
0:22:47.320 --> 0:22:50.760
a point of really cool about startups, like, oh, you know, this startup is losing like

291
0:22:50.760 --> 0:22:55.000
$10 million a year. But what you have to understand is that there are two kinds of losses. There

292
0:22:55.000 --> 0:22:58.320
are the losses that don't make sense, and you're just burning money for no good reason.

293
0:22:58.320 --> 0:23:03.040
And then the losses that are part of a strategy, like Nick's, which is saying, you know, we

294
0:23:03.040 --> 0:23:06.840
are only valuable if we actually have an X system around us. We're only valuable if people

295
0:23:06.840 --> 0:23:11.440
actually use the product. And after that, we can figure out ways to make money. We already

296
0:23:11.440 --> 0:23:17.640
know how we're going to make money, but we can defer that. Okay. Now we can talk about

297
0:23:17.640 --> 0:23:23.000
go to market. Again, fancy way of saying getting customers. You know, you have to remember

298
0:23:23.000 --> 0:23:26.780
that at the end of the day, you're a business, and you need to make money, and paying customers

299
0:23:26.780 --> 0:23:32.800
are your business. Again, you can start by non-paying in the beginning, but you need customers.

300
0:23:32.800 --> 0:23:37.680
One common way of thinking about it is if you build it, they will come. It worked in

301
0:23:37.680 --> 0:23:41.800
the past, but it probably not going to work for you. It worked for Linux because that

302
0:23:41.800 --> 0:23:46.880
was the first open source operating system. It worked for KDE. It worked for a lot of

303
0:23:46.880 --> 0:23:51.400
Linux distributions. But realistically for you, you're going to have a lot of competition,

304
0:23:51.400 --> 0:23:55.720
and people most likely, like the market is most likely very saturated. So people are

305
0:23:55.720 --> 0:24:02.800
not just going to show up. So what you can do, though, is do things that don't scale,

306
0:24:02.800 --> 0:24:09.040
again, as we said earlier. What does that mean? You know people. Ask, you know, email

307
0:24:09.040 --> 0:24:15.200
200 people from your contact list to try your product. Or you're here at Fosdom, just go

308
0:24:15.200 --> 0:24:19.040
to a relevant area or a relevant dev room and just chat to people and just ask them

309
0:24:19.040 --> 0:24:22.680
to try your product. There are a lot of easy ways that are definitely not going to work.

310
0:24:22.680 --> 0:24:26.040
That's not how you're going to get to 100 million customers, but that's how you're

311
0:24:26.040 --> 0:24:29.960
going to get to your first 10. And you want to focus on the easy ones, like trying to

312
0:24:29.960 --> 0:24:33.520
sell to Amazon sounds like a very, you know, like, oh my God, they're going to pay me $10

313
0:24:33.520 --> 0:24:38.080
million a year. That's amazing. But realistically, it's going to take six months until you get

314
0:24:38.080 --> 0:24:42.680
anywhere and then it's going to fail. But even if it doesn't fail and you succeed, it

315
0:24:42.680 --> 0:24:45.280
took you a year and you're probably out of business by the time you even like manage

316
0:24:45.280 --> 0:24:51.120
to scratch the surface on that deal. And again, few that love you are much better than many

317
0:24:51.120 --> 0:24:59.720
who like. Go to market is a very common topic with both technical and open source developers.

318
0:24:59.720 --> 0:25:03.520
The reason why is because we're technical. We don't we don't think about marketing. We

319
0:25:03.520 --> 0:25:07.560
don't think about sales. We don't think about those things. And so a lot of people had a

320
0:25:07.560 --> 0:25:13.120
lot of feedback about that one ship as early as possible. Another one learn marketing.

321
0:25:13.120 --> 0:25:17.280
Another one. And, you know, if you're trying to sell to companies, maybe start by getting

322
0:25:17.280 --> 0:25:21.040
the individuals at home first, because that's much easier than getting the approval and

323
0:25:21.040 --> 0:25:26.800
the contract and all of that going on. Now that you kind of like you're starting to get

324
0:25:26.800 --> 0:25:31.720
customers, you know, there's some traction. You actually have to, you know, have some

325
0:25:31.720 --> 0:25:36.200
metrics. And by metrics, I don't mean Google Analytics and like tracking your customers.

326
0:25:36.200 --> 0:25:43.000
I really just mean like knowing our our things are even going the right way. And so it also

327
0:25:43.000 --> 0:25:46.040
actually like if you know if you're tracking the important things, you can also affect

328
0:25:46.040 --> 0:25:49.960
them. You can know revenue is not growing as much as we wanted. I guess we can, you

329
0:25:49.960 --> 0:25:54.720
know, do something about it. And so you really want to track the most important parts of

330
0:25:54.720 --> 0:26:00.120
the business. Often revenue, but, you know, some precursor to revenue can be, you know,

331
0:26:00.120 --> 0:26:04.960
can be a good one as well. And it's really easy to go for vanity metrics. One of the

332
0:26:04.960 --> 0:26:08.320
founders, I'm not going to put I didn't put a quote from him, but he said that they were

333
0:26:08.320 --> 0:26:13.640
tracking PyPy downloads. So like the Python package manager. That sounds great. The problem

334
0:26:13.640 --> 0:26:17.880
is, again, like CI, all of those kind of bots, all of those things actually download packages

335
0:26:17.880 --> 0:26:21.680
from there as well. And they thought they had a lot of traction, but actually had nothing.

336
0:26:21.680 --> 0:26:26.680
So that's something to keep in mind. So there's some good metrics that you can use. You know,

337
0:26:26.680 --> 0:26:31.760
revenue is always king if you're making money. Great. And but also number of customers using

338
0:26:31.760 --> 0:26:36.800
your production. So a few big companies that everyone knows are already using you to, you

339
0:26:36.800 --> 0:26:40.480
know, to serve millions of customers. That's that's something. Even if you're not making

340
0:26:40.480 --> 0:26:46.160
money now, you can probably make money later. Some insufficient ones are GitHub stars, sign

341
0:26:46.160 --> 0:26:52.040
ups, downloads, Twitter followers, you know, GitHub star is really just someone clicked,

342
0:26:52.040 --> 0:26:56.400
clicked the button. Maybe that someone is a target customer. Maybe not sign ups. Maybe

343
0:26:56.400 --> 0:26:59.080
they signed up and then they dropped because they realized it's not even the product that

344
0:26:59.080 --> 0:27:03.280
they want. You know, they're like a lot of really false signals here. And also GitHub

345
0:27:03.280 --> 0:27:08.120
stars don't mean that you have a great business. So this one has like 240,000 stars, like one

346
0:27:08.120 --> 0:27:12.160
of the tops starred repos, but it's it's a set of tutorials and maybe it's a great business.

347
0:27:12.160 --> 0:27:17.440
I don't know, maybe they can spin it into something. And but it's definitely not a business

348
0:27:17.440 --> 0:27:23.480
on its face value. And but a lot of stars can definitely indicate that you're onto something.

349
0:27:23.480 --> 0:27:28.800
And this is from Superbase. They're at 40,000 stars and they're just growing like crazy.

350
0:27:28.800 --> 0:27:35.520
Every year consistently for two, two years, I guess, that's something. And that's just

351
0:27:35.520 --> 0:27:40.960
like an indication of the market share that they're gaining with developers. So I guess

352
0:27:40.960 --> 0:27:44.880
the main question that we need to ask is whether we should even open source. I talked about

353
0:27:44.880 --> 0:27:48.240
all of that. And before you boo me off stage, and I know this is not the right place to

354
0:27:48.240 --> 0:27:52.360
ask this question, but like, you have to understand it's actually a business decision. At the

355
0:27:52.360 --> 0:27:56.680
end of the day, you took money from investors, you promised them to return them more money,

356
0:27:56.680 --> 0:28:00.120
you got people on board, offered them a job and told them that you're going to be around

357
0:28:00.120 --> 0:28:05.480
for five years. So you have to make the best decision for your business. And there are

358
0:28:05.480 --> 0:28:10.840
reasons for both doing it and not doing it. And so one thing is your customers even care.

359
0:28:10.840 --> 0:28:16.240
Maybe not. Maybe they don't even know what open source is. I don't even know. I don't

360
0:28:16.240 --> 0:28:19.240
want to go with some cliche, but they just have no idea what open source is and they

361
0:28:19.240 --> 0:28:24.320
couldn't care less. Is there a business advantage to being open source? So, for example, when

362
0:28:24.320 --> 0:28:29.400
you're a developer tool, that means that people can try your product more easily. That's great.

363
0:28:29.400 --> 0:28:36.440
Maybe go open source. And does it even make businesses? Are you just going to cut yourself?

364
0:28:36.440 --> 0:28:41.800
Or just kill your own business? So ideology is fine. I've done it for ideology as well

365
0:28:41.800 --> 0:28:45.520
with Ettesync. It started as an open source project. But you just have to remember that

366
0:28:45.520 --> 0:28:52.160
at the end of the day, you're building a business. So there are definitely upsides. Engaged community

367
0:28:52.160 --> 0:28:56.520
really helps. Again, so many volunteers outside handing out flyers about projects, really

368
0:28:56.520 --> 0:29:01.240
promoting them. You can also hire from the community. No need to find great developers

369
0:29:01.240 --> 0:29:05.120
if you already have developers that know your code base and have been contributing code.

370
0:29:05.120 --> 0:29:09.800
Service trust, healthy communication that comes with open source, easier adoption, as

371
0:29:09.800 --> 0:29:15.320
I said, with dev tools. And also the product is just more flexible. People can just fork

372
0:29:15.320 --> 0:29:21.640
it and adjust it to whatever they need. There are also downsides, though. Balanced community

373
0:29:21.640 --> 0:29:26.880
and business needs. Does this one go to the open source product or does this stay as propriety

374
0:29:26.880 --> 0:29:32.640
extensions? Maintainer burnout is a good topic. It's a very front of mind topic for a lot

375
0:29:32.640 --> 0:29:37.120
of people nowadays. And it's absolutely true. And the same with support, right? People asking

376
0:29:37.120 --> 0:29:41.080
questions about your product on GitHub, you want to make sure you're going to give them

377
0:29:41.080 --> 0:29:43.920
the best support possible. But they're not paying you in the end. So you're doing a lot

378
0:29:43.920 --> 0:29:48.440
of free support, which is fine. It's part of being a project. But also it can be overwhelming

379
0:29:48.440 --> 0:29:54.000
at times. It's really hard to say no to things because everything is in the open. And also

380
0:29:54.000 --> 0:29:59.600
like startups win on speed. You really have to compete and move fast. And enabling self-hosting

381
0:29:59.600 --> 0:30:02.520
and doing like database migration, seamless migration, all of those kind of things just

382
0:30:02.520 --> 0:30:06.640
makes things so much harder. And maintaining code bases, which you have to do because you

383
0:30:06.640 --> 0:30:11.000
have going to have customizations for specific customers or you're going to have hacks for

384
0:30:11.000 --> 0:30:14.320
specific customers. You're going to have a ticketing system where you're going to say,

385
0:30:14.320 --> 0:30:18.680
well, you know, customer X asked for this. We have to finish it now. You're not going

386
0:30:18.680 --> 0:30:23.200
to be able to do that in the open just because your customers wouldn't want that. And also

387
0:30:23.200 --> 0:30:27.400
your secret sauce may be public. And you're really just undercutting yourself on price,

388
0:30:27.400 --> 0:30:34.560
and people can just self-host. So there are downsides. Another quote that I like is by

389
0:30:34.560 --> 0:30:40.200
Joseph Jax. He said that don't open source something you don't want to commoditize because

390
0:30:40.200 --> 0:30:43.800
you're open sourcing your secret sauce, you're open sourcing all of the internal structure.

391
0:30:43.800 --> 0:30:48.080
It's actually really easy to mimic or even fork, but definitely to mimic what you're

392
0:30:48.080 --> 0:30:51.600
building. So just assume it's a commodity the moment you release it and make sure that

393
0:30:51.600 --> 0:30:57.880
the stuff that you don't want to be a commodity, they stay proprietary. Okay. So now we can

394
0:30:57.880 --> 0:31:02.920
talk about fundraising. I know this is something that people are often mystified by, even just

395
0:31:02.920 --> 0:31:07.480
by the amount of people that asked me about it in the last 48 hours alone. So happy to

396
0:31:07.480 --> 0:31:14.520
cover a bit of it. So the first thing is that you're dealing with investors. And when you're

397
0:31:14.520 --> 0:31:17.600
dealing with people, you have to understand what do they actually care about and understand

398
0:31:17.600 --> 0:31:23.720
how they think. So the first thing to understand is the power law of venture capital investments.

399
0:31:23.720 --> 0:31:31.080
What does that mean? Let's assume for simplicity that a fund invests in 100 companies. Most

400
0:31:31.080 --> 0:31:35.360
startups fail, so that means 90 are going to fail. And they invest a million in each.

401
0:31:35.360 --> 0:31:40.000
So 90 are going to fail. Okay. They already lost $90 million. And now they have 10 live

402
0:31:40.000 --> 0:31:45.400
companies. Let's say five of them are going to return, sorry, eight of them are going

403
0:31:45.400 --> 0:31:50.080
to return 5x. Okay. That's a good outcome. They invested for a certain amount of money.

404
0:31:50.080 --> 0:31:55.160
It's now worth 5x that amount. Great return. So that's $40 million that they made. And

405
0:31:55.160 --> 0:32:01.680
then the last two, so they lost 90. They just made 40. So they're down 50. So the last two,

406
0:32:01.680 --> 0:32:05.480
the last two companies really need to carry the whole weight of the whole investment fund

407
0:32:05.480 --> 0:32:10.440
to actually make a return. So that means the last two probably need to return 100x each.

408
0:32:10.440 --> 0:32:14.520
So if they invested at a value of 10 million, it needs to be worth a billion now. And it

409
0:32:14.520 --> 0:32:18.960
really the old venture model is based on the fact they're trying to find these one or two

410
0:32:18.960 --> 0:32:23.960
companies in their whole fund that is going to be 100x. You know, Facebook was a 2000xer

411
0:32:23.960 --> 0:32:28.000
or something like that. Uber as well. Like there are companies that are definitely outliers.

412
0:32:28.000 --> 0:32:34.120
Apple, I guess, as well if you, you know, you look at the whole 30 years at a time.

413
0:32:34.120 --> 0:32:40.400
So the moment you understand that they don't care about your 5x, because that 5x was $40

414
0:32:40.400 --> 0:32:45.480
million out of the 240 that they made, you really have to like position yourself as that

415
0:32:45.480 --> 0:32:51.760
100xer. And you also have to understand that they have investors. So even though you're

416
0:32:51.760 --> 0:32:55.600
talking to that person and they love what you're doing and they're like, you know, they're

417
0:32:55.600 --> 0:32:59.580
open source developers themselves. They really want the product, whatever. They have investors

418
0:32:59.580 --> 0:33:02.560
to answer for. They told them, hey, I'm going to invest your money and I'm going to give

419
0:33:02.560 --> 0:33:07.880
you that amount of return. And so really you have to make sure, you know, to understand

420
0:33:07.880 --> 0:33:13.680
that dynamic. It's also, it's their job. I mean, here I wrote, you know, stay in touch,

421
0:33:13.680 --> 0:33:17.400
but really it's their job to waste your time. And they want to like meet you. They want

422
0:33:17.400 --> 0:33:20.400
to like know more about the space because they're going to invest in a competitor and

423
0:33:20.400 --> 0:33:23.820
they really want to understand the space better. They want to know about all the cool companies

424
0:33:23.820 --> 0:33:27.160
so they can tell their friends at the country club that, I mean, that was maybe a bit of

425
0:33:27.160 --> 0:33:30.880
an extreme joke, but they want to tell their friends that they've talked to all of these

426
0:33:30.880 --> 0:33:34.920
cool companies that are just doing very well now. This is not your job. Your job is to

427
0:33:34.920 --> 0:33:40.360
build a company, not to waste your time talking to investors. Another thing to remember is

428
0:33:40.360 --> 0:33:47.160
that not a yes is a no. So investors want to invest in the really good companies. As

429
0:33:47.160 --> 0:33:51.760
I said, they want to invest in the 100Xer. It's really hard to know if this company is

430
0:33:51.760 --> 0:33:54.800
that. So what they're going to say, they're not going to say, well, no, this is stupid.

431
0:33:54.800 --> 0:33:57.240
I'm not going to invest in you. What they're going to say is like, oh my God, this sounds

432
0:33:57.240 --> 0:34:01.040
amazing. I need to build my conviction for a few weeks and I'm going to like do some

433
0:34:01.040 --> 0:34:04.200
research and I'm going to like talk to you then. And then they disappear. But if they

434
0:34:04.200 --> 0:34:08.320
see that some big name investor like is talking to you or like there's some traction there,

435
0:34:08.320 --> 0:34:11.440
then they're going to come back and tell and complain to you and say like, well, you know,

436
0:34:11.440 --> 0:34:14.800
I told you I was interested, but really what they said in the beginning was no, and you're

437
0:34:14.800 --> 0:34:17.360
never going to hear back from them again. So it's really important to count that as

438
0:34:17.360 --> 0:34:23.320
a no and not to count that as a yes. And another thing is that you want to believe the no,

439
0:34:23.320 --> 0:34:28.120
but not the why. So again, they want to invest in you, maybe not even in this company, but

440
0:34:28.120 --> 0:34:34.960
maybe in your next company. But they want to invest in the best companies. And if they're

441
0:34:34.960 --> 0:34:38.880
going to tell you, you suck, you know, you're not going to talk to them the next time. So

442
0:34:38.880 --> 0:34:44.040
they really want to say something nice like, oh, you know, this is our fund is like slowing

443
0:34:44.040 --> 0:34:47.440
down its investments so that really this is not the right time for us. But like, let's

444
0:34:47.440 --> 0:34:51.520
chat again in a couple of months. Really what they mean by that is leave me alone. I don't

445
0:34:51.520 --> 0:34:56.360
want to invest. And so like, don't like don't don't count it as a yes in a couple of months.

446
0:34:56.360 --> 0:35:01.680
Don't count it as a no, essentially. Also, like everything, it's a business, you want

447
0:35:01.680 --> 0:35:04.800
to have a plan, how much are you going to raise? What are you going to actually do with

448
0:35:04.800 --> 0:35:08.200
the money? Like, you know, it sounds good. I'm going to raise $2 million. But are you

449
0:35:08.200 --> 0:35:11.960
going to hire people? What are those people going to achieve? You know, figure those things

450
0:35:11.960 --> 0:35:16.680
out. How much of the money are you willing to sell? Are you willing to sell 90% of the

451
0:35:16.680 --> 0:35:20.040
company for $1 million? Are you willing to send 10? Those are all questions that you

452
0:35:20.040 --> 0:35:24.160
have to come in prepared for because you're dealing with professional negotiators that

453
0:35:24.160 --> 0:35:28.680
are going to repeat the shreds if you don't have like a strong stance on any of those.

454
0:35:28.680 --> 0:35:35.960
Another thing is to speak to investors all at once. So investors talk, as I mentioned,

455
0:35:35.960 --> 0:35:39.640
and they will talk about the cool companies that are chatting with. And if they're going

456
0:35:39.640 --> 0:35:43.120
to see that you've been trying like you've been talking to investors for the last year,

457
0:35:43.120 --> 0:35:47.280
and you haven't raised around yet, that probably means you're tainted goods, and they're not

458
0:35:47.280 --> 0:35:52.080
going to want to invest in you as well. So then the right thing to do is probably try

459
0:35:52.080 --> 0:35:55.560
to invest money, like raise capital for like two, three months. And after that, if that

460
0:35:55.560 --> 0:35:59.760
doesn't work out, just stop, go back to building a business. You know, if you're a developer,

461
0:35:59.760 --> 0:36:02.720
you probably don't need that money anyway. You can just continue building the product,

462
0:36:02.720 --> 0:36:08.960
and then I come back stronger in a few months. And, you know, I'm going to rush this one

463
0:36:08.960 --> 0:36:13.640
a bit, but like if you want to find investors, start with angels. You know, don't chase Sequoia.

464
0:36:13.640 --> 0:36:17.440
They're not going to invest in a small company or like they very rarely do. Don't waste your

465
0:36:17.440 --> 0:36:23.400
time. Build traction with angels, like small checks. And find people that are excited by

466
0:36:23.400 --> 0:36:28.000
the space, invest in similar companies, ask your friends. But really the most important

467
0:36:28.000 --> 0:36:33.160
thing is don't take intros from investors who haven't invested. Investors want to look

468
0:36:33.160 --> 0:36:35.800
good, and again, they want to look like they know all the companies. So they're going to

469
0:36:35.800 --> 0:36:39.000
tell you, hey, I'm going to introduce you. I know a guy, Sequoia. I'm going to introduce

470
0:36:39.000 --> 0:36:44.200
you to him. I know a girl, they're that fund. But really what happens is that if they haven't

471
0:36:44.200 --> 0:36:48.480
invested in you themselves, they're just signals to Sequoia that you've attained good because

472
0:36:48.480 --> 0:36:51.720
they wouldn't want to invest in you. So like why should they? So that's a really bad strategy

473
0:36:51.720 --> 0:36:58.800
to accept those intros. Just say that you're cool. You already have enough traction and

474
0:36:58.800 --> 0:37:03.320
interest. But once they invest, by all means, that's the strongest signal. Someone put their

475
0:37:03.320 --> 0:37:07.880
money on you. Have them introduce, have them go on a building and shout to the world that

476
0:37:07.880 --> 0:37:16.200
have invested and get introductions from them. This is actually where I see founders error

477
0:37:16.200 --> 0:37:20.320
the most. Not because maybe that's the most common place for mistakes. It's just the place

478
0:37:20.320 --> 0:37:25.600
that I'm exposed to the most. Is there a dex in their pitch? You want to really keep it

479
0:37:25.600 --> 0:37:31.000
short. You want them asking for more, not going through 80 pages of boring stuff about

480
0:37:31.000 --> 0:37:36.480
whatever. You want to keep it short, short, short. 10, maybe 15 slides. Really on point.

481
0:37:36.480 --> 0:37:42.640
You want to highlight what's most impressive. In your case, it's probably team, maybe idea.

482
0:37:42.640 --> 0:37:46.880
Maybe if you have a really impressive set of customers, that's great. Highlight that.

483
0:37:46.880 --> 0:37:50.880
But most likely you don't need to analyze your $2,000 a month revenue because, again,

484
0:37:50.880 --> 0:37:55.400
they don't care about that. It's not something that they see impressive. So focus on the

485
0:37:55.400 --> 0:38:00.560
stuff that are impressive. Another thing that people often get wrong is they confuse their

486
0:38:00.560 --> 0:38:05.280
customers with investors. So they go to the investor and assume the investor has the problem.

487
0:38:05.280 --> 0:38:09.120
The investor actually really cares about, I don't even know, I don't have an example

488
0:38:09.120 --> 0:38:13.480
at the top of my head. They really care about this topic. They understand the problem. They

489
0:38:13.480 --> 0:38:18.600
face it themselves. They really feel it. If you told them about all the research that

490
0:38:18.600 --> 0:38:22.520
they've done about this product and how you solve it, they're going to really be interested

491
0:38:22.520 --> 0:38:26.840
about that. The most likely scenario is that they don't even know what you're talking about.

492
0:38:26.840 --> 0:38:31.280
It's not their job to be subject matter experts in whatever it is esoteric thing that you're

493
0:38:31.280 --> 0:38:35.600
talking about. They just need you to demonstrate that there is a problem. People really care

494
0:38:35.600 --> 0:38:38.880
about that. People are going to pay you money. This is how much money you're going to make.

495
0:38:38.880 --> 0:38:42.520
This is how you're solving it. Not necessarily a disorder. This is who you are and why you're

496
0:38:42.520 --> 0:38:50.100
the best person or best team to solve it. And obviously, you want to know your business

497
0:38:50.100 --> 0:38:54.840
inside out. You want to be concise. So let them ask questions. Always iterate. After

498
0:38:54.840 --> 0:39:01.220
every call, I would go back and make sure that I get better after every call.

499
0:39:01.220 --> 0:39:06.040
Find the call. Be calm. Relax. Don't look desperate. They can sense desperation a mile

500
0:39:06.040 --> 0:39:10.040
away. When we were fundraising, I knew that worst case, I'm a developer. I can just build

501
0:39:10.040 --> 0:39:13.240
a product myself. I don't need that money. I would love to have it, but I don't need

502
0:39:13.240 --> 0:39:18.400
it. That kind of made it possible for me to relax and show that confidence that they're

503
0:39:18.400 --> 0:39:23.280
looking for. You're also assessing them. Ask questions. Figure out if you want to take

504
0:39:23.280 --> 0:39:28.240
their money because you're going to be with them for the long run if they're going to

505
0:39:28.240 --> 0:39:35.640
invest. So that's important. Also, only the CEO should go on calls. Don't do party conversations.

506
0:39:35.640 --> 0:39:39.320
First of all, just distraction. But also, you're going to get so many no's. It's much

507
0:39:39.320 --> 0:39:45.120
better that less people get pounded with all of these no's and the other people can actually

508
0:39:45.120 --> 0:39:53.240
focus on the business and continue. So the deal, this is mostly a slide for you to read

509
0:39:53.240 --> 0:39:56.800
afterwards, but there are a lot of topics. Is it simple? Is it fast? Or can you spend

510
0:39:56.800 --> 0:40:24.700
like 200,000 on lawyers in this deal? What are the terms for

511
0:40:24.700 --> 0:40:29.420
that? I don't want your services. I'm going to hire my own designers. That is such a ripoff

512
0:40:29.420 --> 0:40:36.240
if you ask me. Avoid those if you can. So final note about fundraising. You only need

513
0:40:36.240 --> 0:40:40.160
one yes. When preparing this talk, I was just like, I was thinking to my head, how many

514
0:40:40.160 --> 0:40:46.780
no's did I get when fundraising? Then I looked at my notes, it was closer to 50, but I really

515
0:40:46.780 --> 0:40:51.580
couldn't care less because that doesn't matter. You probably need more than one yes. You're

516
0:40:51.580 --> 0:40:53.040
probably gonna get like a few investors,

517
0:40:53.040 --> 0:40:56.240
but once you get a yes, the flywheel is rolling.

518
0:40:56.240 --> 0:40:57.940
Ignore the naysayers, ignore the assholes,

519
0:40:57.940 --> 0:41:00.480
you're gonna meet some really shitty people along the way.

520
0:41:00.480 --> 0:41:02.920
They're humans as well, so just ignore those.

521
0:41:02.920 --> 0:41:05.520
Fundraising is definitely not success.

522
0:41:05.520 --> 0:41:07.920
Fundraising is definitely not company building.

523
0:41:07.920 --> 0:41:09.680
You need to actually build your company.

524
0:41:09.680 --> 0:41:12.160
This is not the end, this is just the beginning.

525
0:41:13.140 --> 0:41:15.800
You may not be able to raise, so manage expectations,

526
0:41:15.800 --> 0:41:17.280
be ready for that, have a plan B.

527
0:41:17.280 --> 0:41:18.880
That's absolutely fine as well.

528
0:41:18.880 --> 0:41:21.280
As I said, very hard to fire investors,

529
0:41:21.280 --> 0:41:22.840
so watch out who you put in your cap table

530
0:41:22.840 --> 0:41:24.280
and who you marry.

531
0:41:24.280 --> 0:41:27.380
And another small point is that many investors

532
0:41:27.380 --> 0:41:30.080
only invest in certain locales,

533
0:41:30.080 --> 0:41:32.760
so like a lot of investors only invest in the US.

534
0:41:32.760 --> 0:41:35.060
That's something to keep in mind.

535
0:41:35.060 --> 0:41:36.760
Y Combinator, big fan.

536
0:41:36.760 --> 0:41:39.000
They fund a lot of open source startups.

537
0:41:39.000 --> 0:41:40.320
They've been transformational for us.

538
0:41:40.320 --> 0:41:41.960
I would really consider applying.

539
0:41:41.960 --> 0:41:43.320
We got rejected many times.

540
0:41:43.320 --> 0:41:45.200
Don't let it hold you back.

541
0:41:45.200 --> 0:41:47.200
There are a lot of great open source startups.

542
0:41:47.200 --> 0:41:48.680
GitLab, Docker, Superbase, Hopper,

543
0:41:48.680 --> 0:41:51.840
so really the list just goes on and on.

544
0:41:51.840 --> 0:41:54.080
So you're gonna be in good company.

545
0:41:55.640 --> 0:41:58.560
One thing is that you need to be aware of the siren song.

546
0:41:58.560 --> 0:42:00.200
So the tempting places where things

547
0:42:00.200 --> 0:42:01.840
usually go wrong for people.

548
0:42:01.840 --> 0:42:04.120
So one place is, as I said, fundraising,

549
0:42:04.120 --> 0:42:05.320
or valuation, or money raise,

550
0:42:05.320 --> 0:42:08.400
or thinking that talking to an investor is actually success.

551
0:42:08.400 --> 0:42:11.000
But again, no, you need to build your company.

552
0:42:11.000 --> 0:42:13.020
And another area that people go wrong

553
0:42:13.020 --> 0:42:15.060
is that thinking that hiring more people

554
0:42:15.060 --> 0:42:15.900
is actually success.

555
0:42:15.900 --> 0:42:17.080
So like, oh, I'm managing 20 people.

556
0:42:17.080 --> 0:42:17.920
How big is your team?

557
0:42:17.920 --> 0:42:19.240
I ask me that all the time.

558
0:42:19.240 --> 0:42:20.660
And we're small.

559
0:42:20.660 --> 0:42:22.280
And the reason why we're small is because

560
0:42:22.280 --> 0:42:23.980
that's what we need to build a kick ass product.

561
0:42:23.980 --> 0:42:25.760
And this is something that you need to keep in mind.

562
0:42:25.760 --> 0:42:28.520
Like burning money does not equate success.

563
0:42:28.520 --> 0:42:30.800
And plain startup does not mean building a company.

564
0:42:30.800 --> 0:42:33.040
So going to pitch competition, startup conferences,

565
0:42:33.040 --> 0:42:36.640
startup meetups, investor chats, all of those kind of things.

566
0:42:36.640 --> 0:42:38.460
Fun, chasing press as well.

567
0:42:38.460 --> 0:42:39.300
Maybe fun.

568
0:42:40.840 --> 0:42:42.000
Honestly, probably fun.

569
0:42:42.000 --> 0:42:43.820
But it really just don't mean anything

570
0:42:43.820 --> 0:42:44.840
for the bottom line of your business.

571
0:42:44.840 --> 0:42:46.200
So just don't do it.

572
0:42:46.200 --> 0:42:48.800
And also remember, you really have not made it.

573
0:42:48.800 --> 0:42:49.960
So really don't do it focused.

574
0:42:49.960 --> 0:42:52.080
The only things that matters are customers,

575
0:42:52.080 --> 0:42:54.220
product, team, and metrics.

576
0:42:54.220 --> 0:42:55.060
That's it.

577
0:42:55.060 --> 0:42:57.640
Everything else is just noise or maybe an enable

578
0:42:57.640 --> 0:42:59.480
to get to everything else.

579
0:43:00.560 --> 0:43:03.640
So some lessons I personally learned the hard way

580
0:43:04.640 --> 0:43:06.680
is that you're no longer an engineer.

581
0:43:06.680 --> 0:43:07.960
I really like coding.

582
0:43:07.960 --> 0:43:08.800
That's it.

583
0:43:08.800 --> 0:43:10.200
I wake up, I love coding.

584
0:43:10.200 --> 0:43:12.320
And it's really hard to remember

585
0:43:12.320 --> 0:43:14.000
that this is not why you raise capital.

586
0:43:14.000 --> 0:43:17.280
Like this is not what my job is at the business anymore.

587
0:43:17.280 --> 0:43:18.360
I'm the CEO.

588
0:43:18.360 --> 0:43:19.720
I need to do just business stuff.

589
0:43:19.720 --> 0:43:20.900
I mean, I can help with the code.

590
0:43:20.900 --> 0:43:22.200
I can help with the architecture.

591
0:43:22.200 --> 0:43:26.300
But my main time should be spent on Go to Market.

592
0:43:27.480 --> 0:43:29.660
Opportunities are not gonna last forever.

593
0:43:29.660 --> 0:43:30.940
So just grab them when you see them.

594
0:43:30.940 --> 0:43:31.780
It's very easy to say,

595
0:43:31.780 --> 0:43:33.920
oh, I'm just gonna perfect this landing page

596
0:43:33.920 --> 0:43:34.800
for a couple of more weeks

597
0:43:34.800 --> 0:43:37.100
and then I'm gonna take this opportunity.

598
0:43:37.100 --> 0:43:38.360
But then the opportunity is gonna be gone.

599
0:43:38.360 --> 0:43:40.560
And we missed a few in the beginning.

600
0:43:40.560 --> 0:43:44.360
And people are gonna be trying to take advantage of you.

601
0:43:44.360 --> 0:43:45.440
So just watch out.

602
0:43:45.440 --> 0:43:48.960
You're running a large budget.

603
0:43:48.960 --> 0:43:50.680
So just watch out for those people.

604
0:43:51.580 --> 0:43:54.800
Be mindful and protective of your time.

605
0:43:54.800 --> 0:43:56.760
So a lot of people are gonna wanna chat,

606
0:43:56.760 --> 0:43:58.180
catch up, whatever, great.

607
0:43:58.180 --> 0:44:01.040
But as I said, you're gonna be working 24 hours.

608
0:44:01.040 --> 0:44:04.000
So maybe spare the 25th hour for some fun stuff

609
0:44:04.000 --> 0:44:05.700
or maybe more work.

610
0:44:07.040 --> 0:44:07.880
And the last thing is that

611
0:44:07.880 --> 0:44:10.200
you really wanna surround yourself with optimists.

612
0:44:10.200 --> 0:44:12.400
The truth is that your startup sucks

613
0:44:12.400 --> 0:44:14.460
and it's gonna suck for the longest time.

614
0:44:14.460 --> 0:44:15.860
So the last thing you want is people

615
0:44:15.860 --> 0:44:17.400
that are negative around you.

616
0:44:18.920 --> 0:44:19.880
A few more things.

617
0:44:19.880 --> 0:44:21.520
Team, super important.

618
0:44:21.520 --> 0:44:22.520
Early team sets the tone.

619
0:44:22.520 --> 0:44:24.840
Bad hires can really derail the company.

620
0:44:24.840 --> 0:44:26.560
Great co-founders can make the difference.

621
0:44:26.560 --> 0:44:28.040
I've seen it multiple times.

622
0:44:28.040 --> 0:44:29.880
But actually better to start on your own

623
0:44:29.880 --> 0:44:33.000
than having a terrible co-founder, which I've also had.

624
0:44:33.000 --> 0:44:36.440
And you're really in control of your destiny.

625
0:44:36.440 --> 0:44:38.760
If something isn't working, you can change it.

626
0:44:38.760 --> 0:44:40.600
The only thing you cannot change is the market.

627
0:44:40.600 --> 0:44:42.640
But really just iterate, iterate, iterate.

628
0:44:42.640 --> 0:44:43.480
You can get lucky.

629
0:44:43.480 --> 0:44:44.660
We got lucky many times.

630
0:44:44.660 --> 0:44:47.120
Just put yourself out there, talk to customers,

631
0:44:47.120 --> 0:44:48.800
and you're gonna notice something that no one else has

632
0:44:48.800 --> 0:44:50.140
and you're gonna get lucky.

633
0:44:50.140 --> 0:44:51.720
And it's really a game of persistence.

634
0:44:51.720 --> 0:44:53.360
You can't lose unless you stop.

635
0:44:53.360 --> 0:44:54.880
Obviously I'm not saying go and bang your hand

636
0:44:54.880 --> 0:44:55.720
against the wall.

637
0:44:55.720 --> 0:44:58.320
You have to have some acumen there.

638
0:44:59.560 --> 0:45:02.920
But as long as you don't give up, you're gonna win.

639
0:45:02.920 --> 0:45:04.840
So just a few closing advice.

640
0:45:04.840 --> 0:45:08.040
It's very easy to think that hiring X will fix everything

641
0:45:08.040 --> 0:45:10.200
or customer X once we get them.

642
0:45:10.200 --> 0:45:11.040
That's it.

643
0:45:11.040 --> 0:45:12.680
The business is gonna go crazy.

644
0:45:12.680 --> 0:45:14.240
Or maybe this investor is gonna change

645
0:45:14.240 --> 0:45:15.320
the destiny of the company.

646
0:45:15.320 --> 0:45:17.320
And maybe, maybe some of them will.

647
0:45:17.320 --> 0:45:19.880
But it's really just on to you to actually fix the company

648
0:45:19.880 --> 0:45:20.880
and make it work.

649
0:45:21.960 --> 0:45:23.640
And you have to remember everything is sales.

650
0:45:23.640 --> 0:45:24.920
You have to really get good at it.

651
0:45:24.920 --> 0:45:25.760
You wanna get customers.

652
0:45:25.760 --> 0:45:26.640
You're gonna get candidates.

653
0:45:26.640 --> 0:45:27.680
You're gonna get investors.

654
0:45:27.680 --> 0:45:29.240
You have to sell them on the vision of the company

655
0:45:29.240 --> 0:45:30.440
and the company itself.

656
0:45:31.920 --> 0:45:34.040
Some more sources of great advice.

657
0:45:34.040 --> 0:45:35.680
NYC YouTube channel, library.

658
0:45:35.680 --> 0:45:38.320
I mean, check it out afterwards in the slides.

659
0:45:39.160 --> 0:45:40.400
And yeah, and that's it.

660
0:45:40.400 --> 0:45:42.360
I just wanna give you like a few closing words

661
0:45:42.360 --> 0:45:45.320
before I open the floor for questions.

662
0:45:45.320 --> 0:45:48.360
So make sure that it's really what you want.

663
0:45:48.360 --> 0:45:50.760
I mean, I've kind of like tried to dissuade you

664
0:45:50.760 --> 0:45:52.200
a bit in the beginning because really,

665
0:45:52.200 --> 0:45:54.400
you need to want to start this company

666
0:45:54.400 --> 0:45:56.320
even with my dissuasion there.

667
0:45:56.320 --> 0:45:59.440
And the only important things are to talk to your customers

668
0:45:59.440 --> 0:46:00.280
and build a product.

669
0:46:00.280 --> 0:46:01.600
Nothing else matters at this stage.

670
0:46:01.600 --> 0:46:03.760
You wanna build something that people love.

671
0:46:03.760 --> 0:46:05.360
You have to remember it's a business.

672
0:46:05.360 --> 0:46:08.560
It's not an open source project.

673
0:46:08.560 --> 0:46:10.840
It's something that you have to actually make money.

674
0:46:10.840 --> 0:46:14.360
And this is the primer, but there's so much more to it.

675
0:46:14.360 --> 0:46:16.200
And this is just to get you from zero to one.

676
0:46:16.200 --> 0:46:17.640
Every stage of the company is different

677
0:46:17.640 --> 0:46:19.160
and there's so much more.

678
0:46:19.160 --> 0:46:21.440
And maybe conflicting advice once you get to the one

679
0:46:21.440 --> 0:46:23.120
and once you get to the two.

680
0:46:23.120 --> 0:46:26.000
And one more thing.

681
0:46:26.000 --> 0:46:29.120
It's your job to be the number one evangelist of the company.

682
0:46:29.120 --> 0:46:30.720
And so always be selling.

683
0:46:30.720 --> 0:46:33.240
And in that spirit, if you need web hooks

684
0:46:33.240 --> 0:46:36.520
or you wanna work at a fast growing startup, yeah.

685
0:46:36.520 --> 0:46:38.720
Come talk to me about Svex.

686
0:46:38.720 --> 0:46:39.560
And that's it.

687
0:46:39.560 --> 0:46:40.400
Any questions?

688
0:46:40.400 --> 0:46:41.240
No.

689
0:46:41.240 --> 0:46:42.080
No.

690
0:46:42.080 --> 0:46:43.680
No.

691
0:46:43.680 --> 0:46:44.520
Bye.

692
0:46:44.520 --> 0:46:45.760
No, no.

693
0:46:45.760 --> 0:46:46.600
Yeah, sorry.

694
0:46:46.600 --> 0:46:47.440
A bit over.

695
0:46:47.440 --> 0:46:48.880
Amazing talk.

696
0:46:48.880 --> 0:47:05.320
Thanks a lot.
