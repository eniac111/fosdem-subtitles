WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
So welcome to my talk, clear skies, no clouds inside, running a business on free and open

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
source software.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.920
A little bit about myself.

00:14.920 --> 00:19.640
My name is Hein-Peter van Brin, but if you talk to me, please call me HP.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.960
My mom does, and it feels much more at home.

00:23.960 --> 00:29.960
I'm a co-founder of two Godot related companies, Prehensile Tales, BV, which is a Godot consultant.

00:29.960 --> 00:38.040
Recently, Ramitaking corporate, which is a company that plans to improve the Godot mobile

00:38.040 --> 00:39.040
experience.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.000
Always be selling, I just heard.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.800
I'm also treasurer of the Godot Foundation, a gigantic nerd.

00:46.800 --> 00:54.040
I started a free and open source hosting site called notabuck.org around the time when,

00:54.040 --> 00:56.040
what was that?

00:56.040 --> 01:03.800
A gatorious shutdown, I think, and my personal blog is at blog.tm.cx.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.000
So what is this presentation about?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.360
First of all, can you run a business entirely on free and open source software?

01:10.360 --> 01:13.400
Should you run a business entirely on a free and open source software?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
Are you mad?

01:14.400 --> 01:16.480
And by that I mean me.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.480
Maybe some of you too.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
I don't know.

01:18.480 --> 01:24.360
What does it mean to do this and how can you actually do this?

01:24.360 --> 01:26.480
What this presentation isn't about.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.080
It isn't a total lesson on managing a large fleet of servers.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.440
There's other talks about that.

01:32.440 --> 01:37.540
There's other people specializing in running data centers with thousands of servers.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.620
This is not this.

01:38.620 --> 01:44.760
This is for a reasonable amount of people and a reasonable amount of servers.

01:44.760 --> 01:49.600
It's also not a lesson in starting a flame war about configuration management systems.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.040
So please don't at me if I say something you don't like.

01:53.040 --> 02:01.520
I am going to say some things you don't like if you are a sysadmin for a much larger organization.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.960
So first of all, can you do this?

02:03.960 --> 02:09.680
Well, I've polled all the speakers on this stage and 100% of them say yes.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.240
So that's a good start, I think.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.640
So why would you do this?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.520
That's I think a question that a lot of people might ask themselves.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.320
I mean, we're all here at FOSDEM.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.240
We're here so I don't have to talk to you about the benefits of open source software,

02:25.240 --> 02:28.200
why you should use free software, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.120
That's not what I'm here for.

02:31.120 --> 02:38.000
So first of all, while you can use free tier of cloud services for almost everything, you

02:38.000 --> 02:40.160
can get most of the features.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.720
Once you start to get to a certain size, even if you're only as a small company, you end

02:44.720 --> 02:51.600
up with five, six, seven accounts for individual users.

02:51.600 --> 02:59.360
And it is very difficult for people to figure out what password to use.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.080
So you either end up with people using very insecure passwords, so you end up having to

03:04.080 --> 03:10.600
force a password policy on them, and then they're just going to write it down or whatever.

03:10.600 --> 03:15.640
And someone still has to fix these issues if they happen in your company.

03:15.640 --> 03:20.400
Now you are a certain suddenly help desk for people forgetting their passwords.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.680
At least that's been my experience.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.440
So access control is actually the real big one.

03:27.440 --> 03:33.960
Once you start to mix a bunch of different cloud services on basic tiers or free tiers,

03:33.960 --> 03:40.560
figuring out who has access to what, if everyone has the access that they need, and most importantly,

03:40.560 --> 03:43.400
new people have more access than they need.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.720
It is very difficult to keep track of which document was shared with whom, why was it

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
shared with that person.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.560
Is it an individual that shared it with another individual?

03:51.560 --> 03:57.000
Is it someone that maybe left the company now but they shared it with their public or

03:57.000 --> 03:59.720
private Google accounts, et cetera.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.480
It's very difficult to keep track of these things.

04:02.480 --> 04:09.640
This could be a problem if you sign non-disclosure agreements with customers, other people that

04:09.640 --> 04:11.280
you work with.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.080
And depending on the business that you actually run, it could be a compliance issue, particularly

04:16.080 --> 04:19.480
now with GDPR, et cetera.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.960
There's a lot of things you have to keep track of.

04:23.960 --> 04:28.280
Of course, I see some of you think, but you can already do this.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.640
In fact, my company already does this.

04:30.640 --> 04:35.520
Yes, it is certainly possible.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.960
But usually, if you want these level of features and these level of integrations, you end up

04:40.960 --> 04:48.240
having to pay actually quite a bit of money for individuals and only to get this fairly

04:48.240 --> 04:53.440
basic level of control over your data.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.200
It also does work if you say, okay, I'm going to pick one SaaS provider.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.160
If you say, okay, I'm going to use only Google products, I'm not going to use anything outside

05:03.160 --> 05:04.160
of Google products.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.400
If Google doesn't have it, I'm not going to use it.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.880
That of course also works.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.720
So is this all about money?

05:12.720 --> 05:15.280
But not really.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.800
I will get to that in a minute.

05:17.800 --> 05:25.860
But the first thing I usually hear from anyone who talks about doing something like this

05:25.860 --> 05:33.040
is either a knee-jerk reaction, as in, but it's actually more expensive to do it yourself.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.560
I don't think that is true.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.480
At least it's not true for me.

05:37.480 --> 05:43.040
So at least it means it's not a truthism that definitely applies to all cases.

05:43.040 --> 05:48.000
Or of course, the other one, it's only free if your time is free.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.080
That is also fair.

05:50.080 --> 05:55.480
But having tried this in a different way, supporting individual people in a bunch of

05:55.480 --> 06:01.440
different time zones in the case of my companies with, oh, I don't have access to this document.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.320
Can you send it to me?

06:03.320 --> 06:11.440
Or I have people working in North America who share a document or fail to do it correctly,

06:11.440 --> 06:15.000
and a person working in Poland needs it the next day.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.920
Due to the time zone difference, they won't get that document until 5 p.m. because nobody

06:19.920 --> 06:24.580
but the person who created it had access to it.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.600
This is also a time sink.

06:27.600 --> 06:35.680
And of course, if the worst came to worst, failing in a compliance case is probably not

06:35.680 --> 06:38.920
going to be free either.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.200
So what is this about, then, if it's not just about money?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.480
First of all, I just like being in control of my data.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.560
I like to know where my data is.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.160
I like to know where it's backed up.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.340
And I like to know that if I need to, I can just stick it on an external USB drive and

06:55.340 --> 06:57.360
take it with me somewhere.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.680
And you just want to hack your data.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.840
I like having unsurprising costs.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.720
I know exactly how much my infrastructure is going to cost this month.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.240
I know how much it's going to cost next month.

07:10.240 --> 07:15.280
If I need to, for a new project, whatever, add five external people to give access to

07:15.280 --> 07:22.400
some shared resources, I know I'm not going to end up paying 150, 200 euros more next

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
month.

07:23.400 --> 07:30.120
And I do forget to not cancel again because I end up keeping paying it.

07:30.120 --> 07:35.680
It gives me a big peace of mind when it comes to access control, what I just talked about.

07:35.680 --> 07:40.440
I know exactly which one of my users have access to what data.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.960
I know why they have access to it because it's based on group memberships.

07:44.960 --> 07:50.600
And I know, luckily, this has not happened, but I also know if something were to go really

07:50.600 --> 07:56.760
wrong, I can, in fact, make sure that people stop having access to the data that I don't

07:56.760 --> 07:59.760
want them to have access to anymore.

07:59.760 --> 08:05.920
By giving people access to just one user ID and one password and one way of logging in,

08:05.920 --> 08:09.440
I feel like I'm making their day just a little bit better.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.800
And that makes me happy.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.200
Just using free and open source software is nice.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.000
I mean, most of the people here are here for a reason as well, so I'm assuming that most

08:21.000 --> 08:23.280
of you agree with that.

08:23.280 --> 08:28.160
If I run a laptop with just free software because it's important to me, why would I

08:28.160 --> 08:31.800
run my business on anything else?

08:31.800 --> 08:38.280
And it feels very good to be part of a community rather than just a customer.

08:38.280 --> 08:43.240
I do pay for certain software.

08:43.240 --> 08:47.160
Let's get into that later, sorry.

08:47.160 --> 08:53.400
But even there, you end up not really being treated so much as a small customer.

08:53.400 --> 08:59.200
You tend to be treated more like a community member to a certain extent.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.760
Also they appreciate good bucket reports more, which is always nice.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.600
But isn't this like super duper hard?

09:07.600 --> 09:12.280
I don't think so.

09:12.280 --> 09:16.760
It is true that you need some things, need to know some things that you might not need

09:16.760 --> 09:21.120
to know otherwise, particularly not if, say, you go in all in on Google Workspace or you

09:21.120 --> 09:25.320
go in all in on Office 365.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.880
You don't need to know a whole lot about infrastructure at all.

09:29.880 --> 09:30.880
For this you do.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.120
I'm not going to lie about that.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.760
The most important thing is actually DNS, tying all of that together, making sure that

09:36.760 --> 09:40.600
your emails don't end up in people's spam folders, et cetera.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.640
Most of this actually boils down to a basic knowledge of DNS.

09:43.640 --> 09:49.080
You're going to need to know a little bit about how to run a web server, how to administer

09:49.080 --> 09:54.160
a web server and what web servers do, but not as much as you might think.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.760
And of course a basic understanding of the Linux CLI.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.880
Or I guess the FreeBSD CLI, if that's what you decide to do.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.880
But it's a similar thing.

10:04.880 --> 10:11.760
So most people when I talk about this have a perception that building something like

10:11.760 --> 10:15.920
this ends up with a cognitive overhead that looks something like this.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.800
It's an extremely complicated set of tools where every individual thing that fails could

10:20.800 --> 10:23.640
break everything.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.000
But in reality it's really not that bad.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.560
You end up with a bunch of containers running on one or more hosts with a simple set of

10:32.560 --> 10:36.880
configuration files that you stuff into Git and that's basically it.

10:36.880 --> 10:42.720
You don't manage 15 things, you manage six things or seven things.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.840
All right.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.320
So how do you do this kind of thing?

10:47.320 --> 10:52.240
Well, the most important thing really is to keep things simple.

10:52.240 --> 10:56.880
As soon as you start looking online about managing Linux servers, et cetera, you end

10:56.880 --> 10:59.640
up finding a whole pile of wonderful tools.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.840
I'm not trying to tell you that you should not use these tools, by the way.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.800
I'm just telling you that in this case if you're just managing two or three servers,

11:07.800 --> 11:12.000
some of these tools might not be what you need.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.960
And trust upstream.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.760
When you use a cloud provider you're just trusting that your cloud provider does the

11:19.760 --> 11:23.440
right thing at any given time.

11:23.440 --> 11:28.580
If you use a piece of open source software, if you use an open source operating system,

11:28.580 --> 11:36.600
if you use an open source NGINX or other web server, trust that upstream tests the stuff

11:36.600 --> 11:38.240
they do.

11:38.240 --> 11:46.520
You don't need a five street test environment just to install a security update on your

11:46.520 --> 11:50.200
operating system.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.920
So how do you keep things simple?

11:52.920 --> 12:01.240
As I said, there's a lot of really great tools like puppet chef, and probably a bunch that

12:01.240 --> 12:02.240
I forgot.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.800
I think there might even be some in this floor that I forgot to include in this.

12:05.800 --> 12:11.200
My apologies if that's one of your projects.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.800
These tools truly are great.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.940
I have been a sysadmin at a large company and without tools like this I would have absolutely

12:18.940 --> 12:20.840
lost my mind.

12:20.840 --> 12:29.360
However, setting up services using these tools is a lot of translating between documentation

12:29.360 --> 12:36.160
you read about the tool into a configuration file format that isn't the one that is documented

12:36.160 --> 12:39.120
on the side of the thing you're trying to configure.

12:39.120 --> 12:47.920
And there's a lot of testing involved, which is great if you need to repeat this on 100

12:47.920 --> 12:53.520
servers, but if it's one box you need to do and that you maybe need to redo in a year,

12:53.520 --> 12:56.360
it's a lot of cognitive overhead.

12:56.360 --> 13:02.340
And if your business grows to the point where this becomes necessary, then probably the

13:02.340 --> 13:08.080
overhead of converting what you did now into a puppet manifest, Ansible or whatever, is

13:08.080 --> 13:14.520
probably not the thing that's going to prevent you from growing.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.840
In that same vein, as soon as you start to look at how do I run containers, how do I

13:18.840 --> 13:20.400
do that myself?

13:20.400 --> 13:25.560
Again, lots of great resources, lots of super great projects.

13:25.560 --> 13:33.280
But if you search on Google, how do I run a server with containers, one of the first

13:33.280 --> 13:36.920
links you're going to find is you're going to get to set up a Kubernetes, you're going

13:36.920 --> 13:47.280
to create an under cloud and an over cloud and you're going to set up redundant, I don't

13:47.280 --> 13:49.400
know, load balancers.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.960
That was the word I was looking for.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.640
And you're going to set all of this great stuff up and at some point when you have a

13:55.640 --> 13:59.480
thousand servers it's just going to be just as easy as if you had a hundred.

13:59.480 --> 14:04.560
Yeah, and I can understand why if you start reading that you get incredibly overwhelmed

14:04.560 --> 14:07.280
immediately because that is a lot of stuff to learn.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.760
And again, you're not going to need it for what we're talking about here.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.720
Again, I think all of these projects are great.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.720
I have used many of them.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.480
This is just not about that.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.600
Please don't add me.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.960
So what does it mean to use simple software?

14:25.960 --> 14:30.040
So in this case, use what is supplied by the OS that you use.

14:30.040 --> 14:34.800
Every piece of software you install that is not in the repositories of the operating system

14:34.800 --> 14:38.480
you use, that is something that you might regret later because that is something that

14:38.480 --> 14:42.960
is not tested by your upstream.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.280
This is again where we come to the trusting upstream part of things.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.720
So in this case, we're going to get there.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.480
I'm using Fedora for most of this stuff.

14:51.480 --> 14:56.480
Use Potman or Docker, use systemd, not whatever else might, a nice thing you might come up

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
with.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.360
And in this case, you are not going to need to do anything too creative.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.960
Use Git for your configuration management.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.080
This is probably the most controversial point of this presentation.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.640
Use a recent OS.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.000
You do not need CentOS.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.600
You do not need Alma Linux.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.160
You do not need Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

15:16.160 --> 15:22.520
You need something where if you read a documentation that it is the last thing that people actually

15:22.520 --> 15:24.760
touched.

15:24.760 --> 15:31.240
People are not writing documentation, generally speaking, on how to set up a modern thing

15:31.240 --> 15:36.960
on an ancient enterprise distribution.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.120
Again, these things have their places.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
I'm not telling anyone.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.360
I'm not trying to tell anyone that these things are bad.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.520
Again, this is about you managing your time and making sure you don't spend a lot of time

15:46.520 --> 15:49.040
doing this.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.200
And upgrading your server every 12 to 18 months really isn't a big deal.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.160
Again, trust upstream.

15:55.160 --> 16:00.080
The enough system upgrade released for the next one 20 minutes later, you have your operating

16:00.080 --> 16:01.240
system upgraded.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.240
It's not a big deal.

16:04.240 --> 16:08.400
Another thing, use preexisting containers wherever possible.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.080
You can, of course, write your own.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.120
Sometimes you will have to for the demo I'm about to give.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.680
I did have to write one.

16:17.680 --> 16:22.120
And don't forget that upstream tends to prefer using their containers over a different way

16:22.120 --> 16:24.920
of deploying their software.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.280
So generally speaking, if you have an issue and you say, okay, I'm running your latest

16:29.280 --> 16:34.600
container version, you're actually more likely to get help than if you installed in any other

16:34.600 --> 16:35.600
way.

16:35.600 --> 16:40.840
Of course, what do we do about backup and disaster recovery?

16:40.840 --> 16:45.360
Well, if you follow the recipe that I'm going to talk about, then basically you have two

16:45.360 --> 16:48.160
directories to backup on each server.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.040
And if something goes wrong, you have two directories to replace back on the server.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.960
And basically your stuff is back.

16:54.960 --> 17:00.120
I will hear the people managing infrastructures for a large corporation saying, but this will

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
take hours.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.120
Yes.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.160
It also almost never happens.

17:05.160 --> 17:13.880
And this way you can be sure that your data is not gone if something goes wrong without

17:13.880 --> 17:19.920
breaking the bank.

17:19.920 --> 17:24.080
Basically speaking, I've been doing this for quite a while now.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.280
And I've had one server fail due to a hard disk failure.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.880
Of course, the server was just using a rate one mirror.

17:32.880 --> 17:37.280
So I just called the people who run the data center.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.320
They replaced the disk.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.760
And there was actually not really a problem there.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.760
I would like to now introduce megacorp.icu.

17:47.760 --> 17:54.840
This is a very big company that has graciously let me demo their environment.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.120
Completely non-evil.

17:57.120 --> 18:03.400
They let me show you their environment because prehencetiles, my own company, the CEO, thought

18:03.400 --> 18:10.520
it was irresponsible to have the internal systems recorded on iFree and open source.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.560
And a developers European meeting thing.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.480
I don't know what they're thinking.

18:15.480 --> 18:21.720
Because nine totally real employees that were absolutely not AI generated.

18:21.720 --> 18:27.640
The thing I'm about to show you is a setup that is roughly looks like this.

18:27.640 --> 18:33.880
There are three hosts running on this laptop, hopefully.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
Configured as such.

18:34.880 --> 18:40.600
So we have three hosts with an overlay network on WireGuard to make sure that these hosts

18:40.600 --> 18:44.360
can talk to each other over local IP addresses.

18:44.360 --> 18:49.880
Even for that being, when you do something like this, you're probably not going to be

18:49.880 --> 18:55.640
able to afford or want to pay for dedicated workspace where your server is nicely lined

18:55.640 --> 19:00.680
up above each other, connected to each other over local connections.

19:00.680 --> 19:04.720
So you need some way for the servers to feel like a LAN.

19:04.720 --> 19:10.320
By doing a simple WireGuard mesh, any one server can go down and the other two can still

19:10.320 --> 19:14.280
talk to each other, which is a nice feature to have.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.640
So and now a hopefully non colossal mistake.

19:18.640 --> 19:31.360
I'm going to try to actually show you what this looks like by using a system like this.

19:31.360 --> 19:40.800
So first of all, this is the basic basically admin interface you might see if you're using

19:40.800 --> 19:42.720
something like this.

19:42.720 --> 19:48.960
So we have our nine users here in LDAP.

19:48.960 --> 19:52.200
And we have a couple of groups here that you can manage.

19:52.200 --> 19:59.000
So I've made a human resources team for which Chatwick and Maxwell are our members.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.760
I made some shared mailboxes that human resources team can also look at.

20:05.760 --> 20:18.200
And so what this looks like here is for instance, let's see, I have a new container tab.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.680
This one I think.

20:21.680 --> 20:28.800
So to show for a little explanation, I'm using a feature of Firefox here called container

20:28.800 --> 20:30.600
tabs.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.080
Basically in the top right here you will see the name of one of the fake users.

20:35.080 --> 20:39.000
I mean totally real users.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.360
And basically Firefox will keep all the cookies, et cetera, separated so I can show you what

20:44.360 --> 20:47.160
it means to log in from multiple systems.

20:47.160 --> 20:52.920
Just a private tab would only give me two Firefox tab containers because it basically

20:52.920 --> 20:58.080
gives you an unlimited number of private tabs essentially.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.920
So that's what we're doing here.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.600
So the first thing we can do is this is the wrong one.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.200
This is the real one of my real company.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.600
Didn't I?

21:08.600 --> 21:12.120
I thought so.

21:12.120 --> 21:16.680
I was smart enough to actually make bookmarks and then I didn't use them.

21:16.680 --> 21:22.800
So the user name of this person is CadenceR.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.560
So first of all, this is basically the login screen that every user will see.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.000
Hopefully only once a day.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.880
The way this works is you log into the system, there is a cookie that gets set for key cloak

21:35.880 --> 21:41.680
in this case and key cloak then does all the authentication with further back ends.

21:41.680 --> 21:46.160
So generally speaking, if everything works properly, your users will only have to log

21:46.160 --> 21:51.720
in once a day, also meaning that your password policies and things like that can be a little

21:51.720 --> 21:55.160
bit stricter because they really only have to remember one and they really only have

21:55.160 --> 22:01.080
to type it in once a day.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.960
So oh yes, this user actually doesn't have access to this.

22:03.960 --> 22:09.160
That was part of the demo, but I forgot that in this case.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.640
We will get there.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.780
Let me show you something that the user does have access to, their email box.

22:15.780 --> 22:24.400
So you see that I just switched from the next cloud to the email server and you also noticed

22:24.400 --> 22:28.680
hopefully that there was not another login prompt.

22:28.680 --> 22:35.040
That is again because these single sign on systems, if you deploy them properly, are

22:35.040 --> 22:36.360
in fact single sign on.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.920
You sign on once and then it should just keep working.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.040
So this is the email box for our user Cadence.

22:43.040 --> 22:49.960
We can see we have an address book with all of the people, all of her colleagues in it.

22:49.960 --> 22:56.760
And here is Chatwick Parsons.

22:56.760 --> 23:01.980
These names are also all AI generated by the way.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.840
So what we can do is we can send an email to Chatwick here.

23:05.840 --> 23:10.840
Let's see, am I doing the right thing?

23:10.840 --> 23:28.560
I can send a little email to Chatwick here.

23:28.560 --> 23:36.920
And now hopefully when we switch to the Chatwick, there we go, Chatwick there, sure it's now

23:36.920 --> 23:38.080
have received an email.

23:38.080 --> 23:46.440
And you see also that the things like small little things like the fact that all of the

23:46.440 --> 23:50.200
users have their own little profile pictures, et cetera.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.440
And these are all consistent across all the applications as well.

23:53.440 --> 24:01.560
So if you look at the Chatwicks, Chatwicks does have access to the next cloud.

24:01.560 --> 24:07.120
There we go.

24:07.120 --> 24:17.200
And you see that this actually shows the same.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.520
You click the same button twice, the same thing happens.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.520
This is very surprising.

24:20.520 --> 24:21.520
All right.

24:21.520 --> 24:25.920
And you see here that the user has this, oh, sorry.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.560
You see here that the user actually has the same profile picture as well.

24:29.560 --> 24:36.800
These profile pictures all came from Active Directory, thank God not.

24:36.800 --> 24:44.760
And from OpenLDAP as well.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.680
So what can you actually do with this?

24:48.680 --> 24:51.840
What is the big thing that I kept talking about?

24:51.840 --> 25:00.120
For instance, here we have a human resources folder that Chatwick has access to because

25:00.120 --> 25:04.400
Chatwick is part of the human resources department.

25:04.400 --> 25:10.880
And so is the guy.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.240
Maxwell is also an HR person.

25:13.240 --> 25:29.200
So Maxwell and Chatwick.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.600
So far everything is still working.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.880
Very good.

25:34.880 --> 25:41.040
You see that Maxwell here has access to the same document.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.960
And there's not been any like sharing here.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.360
It is just a matter of being part of the correct group.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.200
I will show that in a second.

25:47.200 --> 25:55.080
But if you look at the access that this is Alba Kelly.

25:55.080 --> 26:06.360
Thank you for getting this nice handy dandy.

26:06.360 --> 26:10.400
It's not exactly single sign on if you're doing a demo with five different users.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.640
It is only once per user, not once per demo.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.720
I'm afraid.

26:16.720 --> 26:24.960
You see here that the user Alba here does not have access to the shared directory and

26:24.960 --> 26:26.640
cannot see it.

26:26.640 --> 26:35.840
And trying to just send a link to this other person will also not work.

26:35.840 --> 26:40.240
As you see, you just get a found not found error.

26:40.240 --> 26:45.720
Now, what if Alba does become part of the human resources team?

26:45.720 --> 27:03.080
Well, at this point, it's just a matter of adding the member here.

27:03.080 --> 27:07.240
And then in a couple of minutes, hopefully, maybe immediately.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.240
No.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.960
We'll get back to that.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.360
All right.

27:12.360 --> 27:17.240
What's the next thing on my list of things to show?

27:17.240 --> 27:18.240
All right.

27:18.240 --> 27:24.560
I also created this user, Mary J. So what you've seen so far is basically what it looks

27:24.560 --> 27:29.440
like for people who have been working for a while who already know the system.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.200
So what does this look like for a completely new user?

27:33.200 --> 27:35.560
Because that's kind of like another problem, right?

27:35.560 --> 27:45.920
Being people signed up onboard in your organization.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.760
I keep forgetting I made these.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.560
So let's say you tell your new user, okay, the first thing you need to do is just go

27:53.560 --> 27:57.040
to the chat system to say hello.

27:57.040 --> 28:02.680
So we have given the user their initial temporary password.

28:02.680 --> 28:11.640
I sign in and you see that you get just this one little prompt for people to change the

28:11.640 --> 28:12.640
password.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.400
And after that, they're just signed up like everything else.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.460
So this is basically the only real onboarding that your users have to do.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.480
So they don't have to create accounts for multiple things.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.240
You don't have to create accounts for multiple things.

28:25.240 --> 28:31.720
They don't end up having to tie their personal Gmail accounts to some kind of Google Drive,

28:31.720 --> 28:36.160
nothing like that.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.640
And there we are.

28:39.640 --> 28:52.000
The same thing goes for things like the access to, for instance, channels on your instant

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
messaging server.

28:53.000 --> 29:00.560
You see here that Chatwick being part of the human resources group has access to this channel

29:00.560 --> 29:08.080
HR that is not visible to this user, Maria Johnson.

29:08.080 --> 29:12.640
So Maria Johnson is not part of HR, does not see the group.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.520
This is not something that you have to manage yourself either.

29:15.520 --> 29:24.980
We also see here that since Elba was recently promoted to be part of the HR group, she now

29:24.980 --> 29:27.760
has access to the HR channel as well.

29:27.760 --> 29:34.040
Again, this speaks to this access control that I was talking about previously.

29:34.040 --> 29:41.640
You don't have to think about, okay, what things does an HR person have access to?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.160
Did I give them access to the right folders?

29:43.160 --> 29:46.040
Did I give them access to the right shared email address, et cetera?

29:46.040 --> 29:49.760
It's all just taking care.

29:49.760 --> 29:56.640
You only take care of this one time when you set this up, basically.

29:56.640 --> 30:05.760
So there's a couple of other things that people like to use, like editing documents together.

30:05.760 --> 30:22.600
We can do that if I probably should have kept more tabs open.

30:22.600 --> 30:27.880
It turns out navigating a computer is much easier when you're writing a talk and sitting

30:27.880 --> 30:31.880
down instead of facing a room of 700 people.

30:31.880 --> 30:38.840
Not 700 if you're here.

30:38.840 --> 30:44.400
So we have two people logged in here.

30:44.400 --> 30:56.680
And you'll be able to edit things collaboratively much like Google Docs, et cetera, as well.

30:56.680 --> 31:01.720
So you don't really need to lose any features over any of this either.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.600
Let's see.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.720
This is all done.

31:08.720 --> 31:15.200
We have the chance.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.200
Yes.

31:16.200 --> 31:27.400
So these are the services that I added to the demo for this demo.

31:27.400 --> 31:32.600
If anyone has any questions about what other things you could easily do, we have a question

31:32.600 --> 31:35.480
section in a minute.

31:35.480 --> 31:40.640
All right, it lets me go back here.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.320
So I'm assuming that it went super well when I wrote this.

31:43.320 --> 31:50.160
I'm going to give myself three and a half out of five stars on that one.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.480
So can you do this?

31:51.480 --> 31:58.120
I think this little demo shows that for most purposes what people are used to on a daily

31:58.120 --> 32:03.560
basis using their systems, collaborating with each other, et cetera, it is in fact possible

32:03.560 --> 32:05.640
to do it.

32:05.640 --> 32:10.560
I think the user interface is far more consistent than if you compare this to a hot patch of

32:10.560 --> 32:14.400
different cloud services with different login systems.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.280
Different access control systems.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.000
Again, predictable and controllable cost.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.320
You know how much it's going to cost when you start the month compared to how much it's

32:22.320 --> 32:25.480
going to cost at the end.

32:25.480 --> 32:29.560
I think you end up spending less time managing access control.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.240
You just have this one list of groups and members.

32:32.240 --> 32:35.280
You look at who is a member of that group and you know what access they have and you

32:35.280 --> 32:40.120
also know that if you take them out of the group, they will cease having that access.

32:40.120 --> 32:46.200
And that way you also lose less time on people not being able to access things that they

32:46.200 --> 32:51.080
need for their jobs.

32:51.080 --> 32:58.880
So as part of writing this talk, I was setting up the mega corp.icu, various containers, et

32:58.880 --> 33:03.040
cetera, and taking some of the containers that I was running in production and filing

33:03.040 --> 33:07.600
off the serial numbers of the specific things that I used them for.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.800
And I realized that maybe these could be useful for other people as well.

33:10.800 --> 33:17.320
So I created a GitHub project called mega corp.icu that has the containers that were

33:17.320 --> 33:25.000
used in this talk in it as well as some of the tools that I use to manage this.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.680
Perhaps if other people are interested in running their own infrastructures in at least

33:30.680 --> 33:35.360
somewhat the same way that I'm proposing, perhaps we can do some kind of collaboration

33:35.360 --> 33:39.760
with each other and do a sort of CS admin support group.

33:39.760 --> 33:43.560
I don't know.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.560
So questions?

33:44.560 --> 33:51.520
I think I'm a little ahead of where I'm supposed to be, but maybe there will be a lot of questions.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.520
A little plug, as I was just told, that you should always be selling.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.360
My company, Romatuck, is actively hiring people.

33:57.360 --> 34:02.880
So if any of this sounds like it could be you, please contact me.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.880
Okay.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.560
So we've got one roving microphone for questions, but we're going to go online first because

34:07.560 --> 34:09.360
there's some online questions.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.360
Yeah.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.280
The chat's blowing up with this question right here.

34:13.280 --> 34:19.640
What do you think about so-called totally automatic solutions like Unohost or Sandstorm?

34:19.640 --> 34:22.960
Would they also be sufficient for a small business?

34:22.960 --> 34:30.840
So I actually started off using Sandstorm, but found that the access control that Sandstorm

34:30.840 --> 34:38.320
offers is actually not quite...

34:38.320 --> 34:44.760
So with Sandstorm, what usually ends up happening is that you deploy different instances of

34:44.760 --> 34:53.240
the same application that different people will have access to.

34:53.240 --> 34:59.600
What I found is that moving people between groups didn't work properly for that, specifically

34:59.600 --> 35:05.000
if somebody gets kicked out of a container, sharing things between things tended to get

35:05.000 --> 35:07.040
a little weird.

35:07.040 --> 35:16.360
I would say that if it works for you, use it, it didn't work for me personally.

35:16.360 --> 35:20.080
So I have another story.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.320
I started with a small startup.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.800
I was the assistant administrator.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.880
I set up...

35:24.880 --> 35:29.920
Can I ask you the question, please?

35:29.920 --> 35:34.480
So I started to install all the FOSS infrastructure.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.680
It was beautiful.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.680
Next cloud.

35:36.680 --> 35:40.920
I had the audio and many other things.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.880
And then the company got bigger.

35:42.880 --> 35:49.360
And then the president of the company said, I don't like how next cloud link calendars

35:49.360 --> 35:50.640
to email.

35:50.640 --> 35:56.360
And so the next month we switched to Google Doc completely entirely, and the throwaway

35:56.360 --> 36:00.360
all my work of two years and I cried.

36:00.360 --> 36:04.800
So how do you do with the users?

36:04.800 --> 36:07.960
You are the boss that would love to have you as my boss.

36:07.960 --> 36:12.320
But how do you convince users actually to comply?

36:12.320 --> 36:20.520
Well, again, do you need me to repeat the question?

36:20.520 --> 36:25.200
So in my case, indeed, none of that really applies because I am the boss of these companies

36:25.200 --> 36:26.640
and the CEO of both.

36:26.640 --> 36:31.960
So to a certain extent, if you don't like it.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.960
But in practice, people tend to do like it.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.480
Of course, if you have someone that says, okay, I only know how to use this one thing

36:39.480 --> 36:44.320
and I refuse to use anything else, if that person is the CEO of the company, that is

36:44.320 --> 36:47.440
a problem.

36:47.440 --> 36:53.800
I don't really have a good answer for you other than try to convince them that there

36:53.800 --> 36:55.240
are some benefits to this.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.520
In the end, it's their money, right?

36:57.520 --> 37:03.000
So if they are willing to pay, I don't know, $30, $40 a month per user because they don't

37:03.000 --> 37:08.280
like how these things are linked, there is only so much you can do at some point.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.960
Okay, we are going to take an online question and then I am going to go over there for the

37:11.960 --> 37:12.960
next question.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.440
Keep your hands up if you want to ask a question.

37:14.440 --> 37:19.040
I have got a chance of keeping an eye on you.

37:19.040 --> 37:23.120
Okay, so what do you think of Cloudron?

37:23.120 --> 37:24.680
So can you repeat the question, please?

37:24.680 --> 37:27.080
What do you think of Cloudron?

37:27.080 --> 37:29.160
I am not familiar with that.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.840
Have you heard of Cloudron?

37:31.840 --> 37:34.080
Are you aware of Co-op Cloud?

37:34.080 --> 37:35.840
That's another question on the...

37:35.840 --> 37:37.120
I am not, no.

37:37.120 --> 37:48.920
All right, some good ideas here from the people.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.360
What do you use for documentation?

37:50.360 --> 37:53.160
Can you repeat the question, please?

37:53.160 --> 37:59.720
What do you recommend for documentation, like an alternative for conference or notion?

37:59.720 --> 38:01.840
So it's the question, what do you use for video conference?

38:01.840 --> 38:05.320
No, no, no, for documentation, internal documentation for the company.

38:05.320 --> 38:08.480
Oh, what do you use for internal documentation for the company?

38:08.480 --> 38:09.480
Yes.

38:09.480 --> 38:15.720
So in the case of prehensile tales, I use XWiki, which also integrates beautifully with

38:15.720 --> 38:17.560
this whole thing.

38:17.560 --> 38:23.120
People get access to sub pages based on group memberships, etc.

38:23.120 --> 38:27.360
Or user documentation that's not intended to be changed.

38:27.360 --> 38:32.920
So I wrote a little manual on how to do certain simple things on the mail server.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.560
Those are just files that are in a shared folder on the next cloud that everyone has

38:36.560 --> 38:41.560
access to.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
Thanks for the talk.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.600
Very interesting.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.120
One question, I guess all your services are publicly available.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.560
So does Keyclog support something like a two-factor authentication?

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
Yes.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.600
Keyclog does support two-factor authentication.

38:53.600 --> 38:59.400
You can simply add, actually let's not do a demo for something I haven't looked at.

38:59.400 --> 39:02.040
I will not make that mistake.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.360
But yeah, you can add an authenticator app to your account on Keyclog.

39:06.360 --> 39:12.240
And I do that for myself because my account tends to have admin privileges, etc. on a

39:12.240 --> 39:14.660
lot of stuff.

39:14.660 --> 39:19.720
It is possible to also tell configure Keyclog such to make it mandatory for every user that

39:19.720 --> 39:27.840
logs in to set up a two-factor, with an authenticator app.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.680
One thing to keep track of though, because this is something that can in fact take you,

39:32.680 --> 39:34.040
lose you a lot of time.

39:34.040 --> 39:38.600
If you do set it up, make sure you have an MTP client running on all your servers, because

39:38.600 --> 39:40.920
that's going to take you a while to figure out.

39:40.920 --> 39:41.920
Yes.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.000
I have a question.

39:44.000 --> 39:52.520
How do you deal with security since you're running Nextcloud and Keyclog on premise?

39:52.520 --> 39:58.120
You said in some slides before that you update your systems like between 12 and 18 months.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.400
That is not a problem.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.880
But then again, security issues like rapidly rise up, and especially if you're on the public

40:03.880 --> 40:11.160
internet or facing the public internet, you run into, well, huge risks when you are not

40:11.160 --> 40:14.600
on the problem at hand.

40:14.600 --> 40:27.800
I mean, huge risks, sure, in the sense that if a worm were to be developed that goes through

40:27.800 --> 40:35.360
Keyclog directly and it doesn't get patched until it is all wired over the internet, then

40:35.360 --> 40:39.040
that might be a problem.

40:39.040 --> 40:46.960
But in the actual so far security updates for things like Keyclog, Nextcloud, et cetera,

40:46.960 --> 40:55.160
you just become at a cadence of once every month, month and a half, you basically just

40:55.160 --> 40:59.480
tell your Potman container stack to pull the new images and you restart them.

40:59.480 --> 41:04.160
It's two, three minutes of work usually.

41:04.160 --> 41:10.960
So again, it is a concern, but it's not something that's going to be your job to deal with this.

41:10.960 --> 41:15.760
It's two minutes, three minutes to install more security updates most of the time.

41:15.760 --> 41:25.200
Okay, so the question is how do you know that you need to update something?

41:25.200 --> 41:32.920
I just run these pools and updates like every two, three weeks, because like you pointed

41:32.920 --> 41:37.160
out, I don't want it to be my job to figure out all the security updates that are available

41:37.160 --> 41:43.520
for everything, so I just install everything every couple of weeks.

41:43.520 --> 41:49.400
Next question is can you use Purelyfoss for the non-engineering aspects of the company?

41:49.400 --> 41:53.800
For example, accounting software that is compliant with state requirements for regular digital

41:53.800 --> 41:55.600
submission?

41:55.600 --> 42:01.280
So the question is can you use it for things like administrative software and stuff?

42:01.280 --> 42:06.920
I frankly don't know, because I cheat in that regard is that I have an accountant and every

42:06.920 --> 42:11.840
month I send them an email with a pile of PDFs in it and then I get a PDF pack that

42:11.840 --> 42:15.760
says how much taxes they have to pay or return.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.760
I don't know.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.640
I don't have the answer to that question.

42:18.640 --> 42:22.120
But hiring an accountant is a good idea.

42:22.120 --> 42:30.480
If you're ever at the size of one or two people, just get an accountant.

42:30.480 --> 42:34.680
Thanks for the cool presentation.

42:34.680 --> 42:40.240
Since the key word here is to keep things simple, I believe in Key Clock you can have

42:40.240 --> 42:43.600
all the users created locally and have them in Key Clock.

42:43.600 --> 42:50.000
What's the benefit of having LDAP behind that to keep track of the users and having...

42:50.000 --> 42:53.880
So the question is why, if you want to keep things simple, why not just create local users?

42:53.880 --> 42:58.000
Because then you end up with the same problem that you started with with different cloud

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
tools.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.120
Now you have to manage individual access to different tools yourself again.

43:04.120 --> 43:10.520
The fact that there is a group, human resources, that easily works across all the systems means

43:10.520 --> 43:16.120
that the mail server knows who's a member of human resources, next cloud knows who's

43:16.120 --> 43:23.800
a member of human resources, and rocket chat knows who's a member of human resources.

43:23.800 --> 43:34.160
So it just lowers the burden to take that one little bit of extra complexity.

43:34.160 --> 43:38.800
In return you get back this one single thing you have to administer instead of figuring

43:38.800 --> 43:40.680
out how to do that across multiple things.

43:40.680 --> 43:46.520
Also from a purely practical point of view, most programs will support LDAP.

43:46.520 --> 43:50.840
Fewer and fewer programs now support things like PAM or anything like that.

43:50.840 --> 44:01.440
LDAP kind of is what PAM used to be in that respect, for good or bad.

44:01.440 --> 44:08.440
You've been talking about using this in small or small-age companies.

44:08.440 --> 44:14.520
Do you foresee at which point this would not work anymore, like in terms of size of the

44:14.520 --> 44:16.480
company?

44:16.480 --> 44:27.400
So I think there's going to be an inflection point specifically when vertical scaling stops

44:27.400 --> 44:28.960
to work, basically.

44:28.960 --> 44:35.000
So if I need more than one piece of hardware to run all of the chat users on, I think at

44:35.000 --> 44:38.640
that point it's going to be a problem.

44:38.640 --> 44:45.200
If I get so many files that I cannot reasonably store them any longer on a server that you

44:45.200 --> 44:52.760
can reasonably rent, right now you can get a rate one NVMe server with two times four

44:52.760 --> 44:58.960
terabytes of disk space for like $100 a month.

44:58.960 --> 45:04.040
Once things like that stop scaling, I think that is when you might start to have a problem.

45:04.040 --> 45:07.160
The way I think about that, though, is by the time I have that problem, I will also

45:07.160 --> 45:16.400
probably have enough people to get a sysadmin to figure that stuff out for me.

45:16.400 --> 45:21.920
How often have you had to report or fix bugs in the stack that you're using?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.320
How often do you have to fix and report bugs?

45:24.320 --> 45:29.920
So that is exactly how often I don't know.

45:29.920 --> 45:33.960
I'm not going to lie, that happens with some regularity.

45:33.960 --> 45:40.400
I currently have a bug open with Nextcloud, for instance, that sometimes the avatar icons

45:40.400 --> 45:43.080
disappear.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.080
That is annoying.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.600
Things like that are annoying.

45:45.600 --> 45:50.520
But then again, I also have had bugs open for pieces of software I've paid for that

45:50.520 --> 45:53.560
are never fixed.

45:53.560 --> 45:59.360
It's not a panacea, I believe is the word you, is how you pronounce that.

45:59.360 --> 46:05.360
But it's not something, it's not like the things are constantly breaking and I'm constantly

46:05.360 --> 46:06.840
fixing things.

46:06.840 --> 46:07.840
Absolutely not.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.840
A minute ago there was a question up here.

46:10.840 --> 46:11.840
Has it gone away?

46:11.840 --> 46:12.840
Just in this front block here.

46:12.840 --> 46:17.840
No, right, okay, we'll go over here.

46:17.840 --> 46:22.800
Keeps me fit.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.240
Somebody's getting some steps.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
Hi, thanks.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.040
That was a really good talk.

46:29.040 --> 46:54.280
I think the question is, is there anyone in the room who does know how to do open source

46:54.280 --> 46:55.280
accounting?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.800
Is it certainly not me?

46:56.800 --> 47:02.480
That has a second vote from me as well.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.480
Anyone?

47:03.480 --> 47:10.000
Hold up, put your hand up.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.120
VRP Next, you say?

47:14.120 --> 47:15.120
PRP?

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
I'm sorry.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.120
I'm sorry.

47:17.120 --> 47:18.120
I'm sorry.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.120
I'm sorry.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.120
I'm sorry.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
I'm sorry.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.120
I'm sorry.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.120
I'm sorry.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
I'm sorry.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
I'm sorry.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
I'm sorry.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.120
I'm sorry.

47:27.120 --> 47:28.120
No, that's not.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.120
No.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
Every regulation is in it.

47:30.120 --> 47:31.240
You have to build it yourself.

47:31.240 --> 47:36.240
But ERP Next is an open source solution to manage your accounting stuff.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.240
Cool.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.240
Thank you.

47:38.240 --> 47:43.100
Did we have more questions?

47:43.100 --> 47:45.600
I have a question here.

47:45.600 --> 47:51.000
How much time is needed in on average per month to set up the infrastructure and maintain

47:51.000 --> 47:53.420
it?

47:53.420 --> 47:59.460
up the infrastructure, well, I felt like it wasn't too much work to set up an entirely

47:59.460 --> 48:01.400
new infrastructure just for this talk.

48:01.400 --> 48:07.660
So I mean, it should give you some indication that it's not like a weeks-long process.

48:07.660 --> 48:10.860
As in how much time does it take me per month to run this?

48:10.860 --> 48:16.140
It is a little bit variable.

48:16.140 --> 48:25.620
So just installing security updates and just keeping those things running maybe...

48:25.620 --> 48:27.340
So it's never consecutive, right?

48:27.340 --> 48:37.340
I think it's fair to say that I spent about an hour a month maintaining the infrastructure.

48:37.340 --> 48:41.420
I don't think I spent a whole lot more than that.

48:41.420 --> 48:47.980
Of course this number can ramp up rather dramatically if you get a hardware failure, like a broken

48:47.980 --> 48:52.860
hard drive in a server can now mean that you have to spend two or three hours talking with

48:52.860 --> 48:58.740
your data center people planning to get a disk replaced, waiting for the disk to be

48:58.740 --> 49:02.100
replaced, putting it back in your rates at et cetera.

49:02.100 --> 49:05.620
So at that point you might lose a couple more hours.

49:05.620 --> 49:13.380
But yeah, it's in the order of hours per month, not days.

49:13.380 --> 49:16.980
Hi.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.980
Have you tried to do it in high availability?

49:19.980 --> 49:25.900
So do you have any problems with like a next layer of the complication?

49:25.900 --> 49:32.060
If you have one key clock in machine A, then second key clock on machine B or data center

49:32.060 --> 49:35.620
B, what's your idea here?

49:35.620 --> 49:39.580
Because if you use, I don't know, Google, it's just one Gmail comment.

49:39.580 --> 49:41.060
Yeah, you are fine.

49:41.060 --> 49:44.840
Yeah, so the question is what do you do about redundancy?

49:44.840 --> 49:48.580
So there's actually one of those things where it's very easy to fall into a trap and which

49:48.580 --> 49:51.660
is kind of what this talk was hoped to be about.

49:51.660 --> 49:55.020
It's that you don't really need that most of the time.

49:55.020 --> 49:57.100
Make sure that your data is safe.

49:57.100 --> 50:04.220
But if you have a company of 10, 15, 20 people, if people can't log in in the middle of the

50:04.220 --> 50:09.020
night, it means that you are also sleeping and all your employees are also sleeping.

50:09.020 --> 50:15.700
So this is not something that worries me at all.

50:15.700 --> 50:19.340
It's not to say that, again, not to say that you should never worry about it, not saying

50:19.340 --> 50:22.740
that anyone who does worry about it is wrong.

50:22.740 --> 50:28.140
But just in the type of deployment that I'm talking about, a couple of hours downtime

50:28.140 --> 50:30.100
is not the end of the world.

50:30.100 --> 50:33.420
And we've seen it's not the end of the world because Azure just went down for like seven

50:33.420 --> 50:36.740
hours and we're all still here.

50:36.740 --> 50:38.620
Okay.

50:38.620 --> 50:39.620
Thank you all very much.

50:39.620 --> 50:41.500
Thank you, HP, for your talk.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.500
That's great.

50:42.500 --> 50:43.500
So a question.

50:43.500 --> 50:53.460
Thank you for coming.
