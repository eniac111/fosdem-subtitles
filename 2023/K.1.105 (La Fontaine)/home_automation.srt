0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:06.120
My name is Bruce Mamjan.

2
0:00:06.120 --> 0:00:08.640
I live in Philadelphia.

3
0:00:08.640 --> 0:00:09.640
Glad to be here.

4
0:00:09.640 --> 0:00:13.560
I've been attending FOSDIM since 2003.

5
0:00:13.560 --> 0:00:19.420
This is my first time in a huge room, so I guess I'm going up in the world.

6
0:00:19.420 --> 0:00:26.880
This presentation is actually part of a 20-year journey for me using home automation.

7
0:00:26.880 --> 0:00:32.040
Not a whole lot of 20-year home automation folks out there, but I'm one of them.

8
0:00:32.040 --> 0:00:36.720
What this talk is going to be is walking you through that journey and giving you a lot

9
0:00:36.720 --> 0:00:40.680
of practical experience of what I've learned.

10
0:00:40.680 --> 0:00:45.760
Hopefully leaving here, you'll have a better idea of not only what home automation things

11
0:00:45.760 --> 0:00:53.840
you can do, but also what home automation things are worth doing.

12
0:00:53.840 --> 0:00:55.300
That's a distinction.

13
0:00:55.300 --> 0:00:58.640
What you can do and what you should do are not always the same.

14
0:00:58.640 --> 0:01:01.260
I will give you some examples of that.

15
0:01:01.260 --> 0:01:05.400
If you're interested in my slides, they are right here on this website, in addition to

16
0:01:05.400 --> 0:01:08.080
this QR code right here.

17
0:01:08.080 --> 0:01:13.040
I am a Postgres core team member, so that's where you actually will also find 58 other

18
0:01:13.040 --> 0:01:18.320
Postgres talks and a lot of other Postgres things, but this has nothing to do with Postgres,

19
0:01:18.320 --> 0:01:21.320
so feel relaxed.

20
0:01:21.320 --> 0:01:22.960
I expect this to be an interesting talk.

21
0:01:22.960 --> 0:01:28.080
We'll take questions as I go about specific topics, and then I'll leave time at the end

22
0:01:28.080 --> 0:01:29.840
for general topics, if that's okay.

23
0:01:29.840 --> 0:01:31.400
I'll just walk through.

24
0:01:31.400 --> 0:01:37.800
I'll ask for specific questions on a specific thing, and then at the end we'll have time.

25
0:01:37.800 --> 0:01:39.920
What are we going to talk about?

26
0:01:39.920 --> 0:01:45.920
First we'll talk about what is computerized automation?

27
0:01:45.920 --> 0:01:50.440
I know that might sound kind of trivial to you, but I'm going to explain what automation

28
0:01:50.440 --> 0:01:54.160
is and then what computerized automation is slightly different.

29
0:01:54.160 --> 0:01:58.280
We're then going to evaluate some technologies I'm actually using because I've been using

30
0:01:58.280 --> 0:02:00.480
automation for so long.

31
0:02:00.480 --> 0:02:03.240
My automation goes back to the 1980s.

32
0:02:03.240 --> 0:02:04.640
Yes, amazingly.

33
0:02:04.640 --> 0:02:06.720
They had automation back then.

34
0:02:06.720 --> 0:02:09.720
Why are we not all flying around in cars?

35
0:02:09.720 --> 0:02:10.720
Right?

36
0:02:10.720 --> 0:02:12.920
I have robot helpers.

37
0:02:12.920 --> 0:02:18.280
I don't know, but again, this technology has been around for a long time, and I will talk

38
0:02:18.280 --> 0:02:21.080
a little bit about some of the evolving technologies.

39
0:02:21.080 --> 0:02:25.480
We even had some new technology in the past six months.

40
0:02:25.480 --> 0:02:30.160
It's a very hot field now when I was doing it, not so much.

41
0:02:30.160 --> 0:02:36.840
We'll talk about a sample deployment, basically how I kind of went at the problem.

42
0:02:36.840 --> 0:02:41.520
Again, I'm going to be using old technology, but it's going to be the same process that

43
0:02:41.520 --> 0:02:43.800
you're going to go through.

44
0:02:43.800 --> 0:02:48.920
You have to sometimes avoid being overwhelmed by having too many options, and I'll try and

45
0:02:48.920 --> 0:02:53.360
explain how to sort of hone in on that.

46
0:02:53.360 --> 0:02:59.040
I'll also explain what happens if you overdo automation because nobody really talks about

47
0:02:59.040 --> 0:03:00.040
that.

48
0:03:00.040 --> 0:03:02.200
Everything sounds wonderful, but not always true.

49
0:03:02.200 --> 0:03:07.600
I'm going to talk about some of the programming issues I have, and then toward the end, we're

50
0:03:07.600 --> 0:03:09.340
going to talk about what is success?

51
0:03:09.340 --> 0:03:12.680
What does home automation success look like?

52
0:03:12.680 --> 0:03:18.240
Again, just because you can do something and it works doesn't mean it's actually benefiting

53
0:03:18.240 --> 0:03:19.760
your life.

54
0:03:19.760 --> 0:03:21.280
That's what I'm going to try and cover.

55
0:03:21.280 --> 0:03:25.840
Finally, I'll talk about a couple applications that I've been challenged with, and then obviously

56
0:03:25.840 --> 0:03:27.920
some solutions to that.

57
0:03:27.920 --> 0:03:29.920
All right.

58
0:03:29.920 --> 0:03:31.880
Let's talk about automation.

59
0:03:31.880 --> 0:03:36.040
What is non-programmatic automation?

60
0:03:36.040 --> 0:03:41.800
This is the concept of you've automated something, but it doesn't necessarily have computer control.

61
0:03:41.800 --> 0:03:51.280
It's not something that you can programmatically adjust and basically control.

62
0:03:51.280 --> 0:03:55.320
Things like, I don't know how many of you are old enough to remember that years ago

63
0:03:55.320 --> 0:04:00.080
you used to have timers that you'd plug into lamps and you'd have a dial.

64
0:04:00.080 --> 0:04:01.080
Yeah, okay.

65
0:04:01.080 --> 0:04:02.640
Yeah, you still have them.

66
0:04:02.640 --> 0:04:03.640
That's good.

67
0:04:03.640 --> 0:04:05.240
Although, there's older people who are raising their hand.

68
0:04:05.240 --> 0:04:10.400
There's just one younger person there, but they'd have a dial and you'd turn it and you'd

69
0:04:10.400 --> 0:04:11.400
set the time.

70
0:04:11.400 --> 0:04:17.600
Then every time you lost power, you had to go back and set the dial to the right time.

71
0:04:17.600 --> 0:04:20.520
That is not programmatic automation.

72
0:04:20.520 --> 0:04:23.000
How many people have heard of something called the clapper?

73
0:04:23.000 --> 0:04:25.200
Oh my goodness.

74
0:04:25.200 --> 0:04:26.200
Yeah.

75
0:04:26.200 --> 0:04:31.160
If you want a howl, take a look at an old commercial video.

76
0:04:31.160 --> 0:04:35.520
It basically was a lamp that you would clap your hands and it would turn on and then you'd

77
0:04:35.520 --> 0:04:37.480
clap your hands and it would turn off.

78
0:04:37.480 --> 0:04:39.120
Hence the name clapper.

79
0:04:39.120 --> 0:04:40.120
Okay.

80
0:04:40.120 --> 0:04:42.080
Darn dust sensors.

81
0:04:42.080 --> 0:04:46.320
You see those, of course, everywhere where when it gets dark, the lights go on.

82
0:04:46.320 --> 0:04:48.600
When it gets light, the lights go on.

83
0:04:48.600 --> 0:04:52.600
It's not programmatic, but it works really well.

84
0:04:52.600 --> 0:04:54.080
Of course, motion sensors.

85
0:04:54.080 --> 0:04:59.120
Those have gotten much more sophisticated over time, but again, years ago they had even

86
0:04:59.120 --> 0:05:00.120
the idea of motion sensors.

87
0:05:00.120 --> 0:05:04.440
Somebody would get close to the garage or walking to an entryway and the light would

88
0:05:04.440 --> 0:05:05.440
go on.

89
0:05:05.440 --> 0:05:06.440
Very convenient.

90
0:05:06.440 --> 0:05:08.720
Not programmatic, but very convenient.

91
0:05:08.720 --> 0:05:12.600
Then we're going to talk about programmatic automation.

92
0:05:12.600 --> 0:05:19.560
This has really exploded in the past, I don't know, five years I'd say.

93
0:05:19.560 --> 0:05:26.280
For example, the concept of voice automation, voice control is something that obviously

94
0:05:26.280 --> 0:05:29.280
really didn't exist effectively 20 years ago.

95
0:05:29.280 --> 0:05:32.640
Now it's hugely popular.

96
0:05:32.640 --> 0:05:40.240
The interesting thing about programmatic automation is that it allows you to take, you see the

97
0:05:40.240 --> 0:05:45.920
non-programmatic automation, the automation was kind of built into the device.

98
0:05:45.920 --> 0:05:52.320
You had the clapper or you had a motion sensor or you had a dawn dust sensor.

99
0:05:52.320 --> 0:05:54.160
You couldn't really change it.

100
0:05:54.160 --> 0:05:56.960
It was wired into how the device behaved.

101
0:05:56.960 --> 0:06:01.280
You couldn't combine that with some other device or combine it with some other inputs

102
0:06:01.280 --> 0:06:03.240
and make something different happen.

103
0:06:03.240 --> 0:06:07.600
Not that it wasn't useful, but programmatic allows you to combine behavior.

104
0:06:07.600 --> 0:06:10.440
It also allows you to do distance things.

105
0:06:10.440 --> 0:06:18.400
Again, one of the examples would be somebody comes into the garage, the garage door is

106
0:06:18.400 --> 0:06:25.080
open and some other action happens somewhere else in the house.

107
0:06:25.080 --> 0:06:29.440
Not usually something that would happen in a non-programmatic way, but it's easy to do

108
0:06:29.440 --> 0:06:32.960
if you're on a network of some type.

109
0:06:32.960 --> 0:06:40.360
Activity detection, being able to write scripts and basically programs that control with the

110
0:06:40.360 --> 0:06:43.280
automation incredibly powerful.

111
0:06:43.280 --> 0:06:47.920
Then finally, and I'll talk about this a little later, the idea of even bringing in external

112
0:06:47.920 --> 0:06:52.600
data and having the external data affect your home automation.

113
0:06:52.600 --> 0:06:56.800
For example, how cold is it outside?

114
0:06:56.800 --> 0:07:04.180
You may not have a home automation thermometer outside of your house, but you may be able

115
0:07:04.180 --> 0:07:08.520
to go to the weather service and find out how cold it is and change your automation

116
0:07:08.520 --> 0:07:09.520
based on that.

117
0:07:09.520 --> 0:07:13.040
Again, this is where I think it gets really interesting and you're going to see a lot

118
0:07:13.040 --> 0:07:15.320
of examples of that.

119
0:07:15.320 --> 0:07:17.120
Any questions so far?

120
0:07:17.120 --> 0:07:19.120
All right.

121
0:07:19.120 --> 0:07:22.880
Now, evaluating your technology.

122
0:07:22.880 --> 0:07:29.760
Now I'm going way, way back in history here, but basically what is a network?

123
0:07:29.760 --> 0:07:33.000
What is the ability to communicate distances?

124
0:07:33.000 --> 0:07:38.400
Well, one of the early networks I didn't even list here is the telegraph.

125
0:07:38.400 --> 0:07:44.680
Now I was a history major, so I studied the impact of the telegraph on society and it

126
0:07:44.680 --> 0:07:46.160
was pretty dramatic, right?

127
0:07:46.160 --> 0:07:51.080
Something could happen in New York City and within several minutes, people in Europe or

128
0:07:51.080 --> 0:07:55.120
people on the west coast would know about it right away.

129
0:07:55.120 --> 0:07:57.000
That's pretty impressive.

130
0:07:57.000 --> 0:07:59.320
The telephone, of course, is a network.

131
0:07:59.320 --> 0:08:03.480
You used to dial a number.

132
0:08:03.480 --> 0:08:08.680
It used to make sparks in the phone.

133
0:08:08.680 --> 0:08:12.520
That doesn't happen anymore, but you dial a number and somewhere some distant person

134
0:08:12.520 --> 0:08:13.520
answers.

135
0:08:13.520 --> 0:08:19.160
Courtless telephones, I was around long enough to remember when those came out.

136
0:08:19.160 --> 0:08:24.800
All of a sudden you didn't have to have the receiver connected with a wire anymore.

137
0:08:24.800 --> 0:08:28.200
It's a sort of network, right?

138
0:08:28.200 --> 0:08:34.280
Then we had Ethernet, which obviously has been around since, as I remember, somewhere

139
0:08:34.280 --> 0:08:35.280
in the 90s.

140
0:08:35.280 --> 0:08:40.360
Before that it was like token ring and a whole bunch of weird stuff on coax.

141
0:08:40.360 --> 0:08:45.240
Although you can still do Ethernet on coax, but you get the idea.

142
0:08:45.240 --> 0:08:48.400
Wireless networks, I remember when those came out, so all of a sudden now I didn't have

143
0:08:48.400 --> 0:08:51.240
to be tethered with a wire Ethernet.

144
0:08:51.240 --> 0:08:54.880
I could do it wirelessly.

145
0:08:54.880 --> 0:09:00.800
This fourth one here, electrical network.

146
0:09:00.800 --> 0:09:03.160
I'm going to show you how that's actually a network.

147
0:09:03.160 --> 0:09:07.200
You might not have thought of that, but it is and I'll show you why.

148
0:09:07.200 --> 0:09:13.600
And then finally we're going to talk about some new wireless networks that are available.

149
0:09:13.600 --> 0:09:19.920
Looking historically, kind of a very 10,000 foot view of what's going on, the technology

150
0:09:19.920 --> 0:09:24.120
you're going to see me using from the 80s is something called X10.

151
0:09:24.120 --> 0:09:25.640
I'll show you how it works.

152
0:09:25.640 --> 0:09:27.440
I'll show you some wiring diagrams.

153
0:09:27.440 --> 0:09:29.160
I was kind of impressed over here.

154
0:09:29.160 --> 0:09:33.880
I got a nice little electrical sticker here.

155
0:09:33.880 --> 0:09:35.960
I was like, oh, it's an electrical panel.

156
0:09:35.960 --> 0:09:36.960
Very exciting.

157
0:09:36.960 --> 0:09:39.920
We're going to show you a little bit of that.

158
0:09:39.920 --> 0:09:44.880
There is something called universal power bus, which I don't think it's even around

159
0:09:44.880 --> 0:09:48.040
anymore, but it was an early way of doing the same thing.

160
0:09:48.040 --> 0:09:51.120
And then we have things like Z-Wave and Zigbee.

161
0:09:51.120 --> 0:09:58.240
They are somewhat confusing because they both begin with Z, but Zigbee is the one you normally

162
0:09:58.240 --> 0:09:59.280
see.

163
0:09:59.280 --> 0:10:01.280
It is an international standard.

164
0:10:01.280 --> 0:10:07.480
Z-Wave is a proprietary interface that you don't see around a whole lot anymore.

165
0:10:07.480 --> 0:10:14.920
There used to be something called Insteon, which I think is still around, but again,

166
0:10:14.920 --> 0:10:16.600
you don't see it pretty much anymore.

167
0:10:16.600 --> 0:10:21.440
I wanted to talk a little bit about a brand new standard that just came out in the fall

168
0:10:21.440 --> 0:10:26.520
of last year, so maybe four or six months ago, called Matter.

169
0:10:26.520 --> 0:10:28.640
How many people have heard of Matter?

170
0:10:28.640 --> 0:10:29.640
Wow.

171
0:10:29.640 --> 0:10:30.640
Okay.

172
0:10:30.640 --> 0:10:31.640
That's great.

173
0:10:31.640 --> 0:10:32.640
Okay.

174
0:10:32.640 --> 0:10:39.160
Matter is basically not...I want to qualify what that is.

175
0:10:39.160 --> 0:10:42.080
It's not really a network.

176
0:10:42.080 --> 0:10:48.520
It's really a protocol for devices using different networks to communicate.

177
0:10:48.520 --> 0:10:56.280
Up until now, for example, if you had a Zigbee, Philips Hue light bulb, let's say, you had

178
0:10:56.280 --> 0:11:00.560
to communicate with it using a Philips app or a Philips hub.

179
0:11:00.560 --> 0:11:09.200
The idea of Matter is that it's going to allow for home automation using different protocols.

180
0:11:09.200 --> 0:11:10.200
Could be Zigbee.

181
0:11:10.200 --> 0:11:13.100
I believe it's for its X10.

182
0:11:13.100 --> 0:11:20.640
It could be something like Thread, which is kind of a lousy name, frankly, because it's

183
0:11:20.640 --> 0:11:23.320
confusing so many things with Threads.

184
0:11:23.320 --> 0:11:29.640
It's a new protocol for low-powered devices, which you have a lot of those things now.

185
0:11:29.640 --> 0:11:35.200
If you want to get a lowdown on that, I've got a great article here.

186
0:11:35.200 --> 0:11:37.600
I also have some websites down here.

187
0:11:37.600 --> 0:11:41.920
Anything in blue is basically something you can click on if you download the PDF.

188
0:11:41.920 --> 0:11:45.960
You can just click on the blue and it pulls up the site for you.

189
0:11:45.960 --> 0:11:49.160
Again, a lot of opportunities.

190
0:11:49.160 --> 0:11:56.520
It's sort of thinking back.

191
0:11:56.520 --> 0:12:02.480
When X10 came out in the 80s, there was a sense that home automation is now here.

192
0:12:02.480 --> 0:12:04.640
We're going to be able to do all this stuff.

193
0:12:04.640 --> 0:12:09.240
35 years went by and really nothing happened.

194
0:12:09.240 --> 0:12:15.720
I was the only guy, the person doing it.

195
0:12:15.720 --> 0:12:19.040
Eventually now you hear a lot more about it and there's a lot more excitement about it,

196
0:12:19.040 --> 0:12:23.920
partially because the technology has advanced, partially because there's more options, partially

197
0:12:23.920 --> 0:12:30.360
because more people are doing things electronically or they're used to that interface and people

198
0:12:30.360 --> 0:12:31.360
are getting used to it.

199
0:12:31.360 --> 0:12:37.520
There's still some limitations and I'll talk about that.

200
0:12:37.520 --> 0:12:41.640
Not only do I do home automation, but I think I've inspired my family.

201
0:12:41.640 --> 0:12:43.240
My son does home automation.

202
0:12:43.240 --> 0:12:49.200
He's a big home kit person, a home kit being the Apple home automation thingy.

203
0:12:49.200 --> 0:12:52.400
I have a brother who does it.

204
0:12:52.400 --> 0:12:54.600
Most of his stuff is Zigbee.

205
0:12:54.600 --> 0:12:58.520
I have a nephew who does it who also uses a lot of Zigbee stuff.

206
0:12:58.520 --> 0:13:01.560
I have some interesting stories about that.

207
0:13:01.560 --> 0:13:06.440
Some good, some bad or problems that they had.

208
0:13:06.440 --> 0:13:11.800
I'll talk about that when I kind of get a little farther ahead.

209
0:13:11.800 --> 0:13:13.920
Choosing the network.

210
0:13:13.920 --> 0:13:17.240
Let's suppose you're going to use some network technology or you're going to use some kind

211
0:13:17.240 --> 0:13:18.240
of home automation.

212
0:13:18.240 --> 0:13:24.840
One of the first things you have to figure out is what do I want to measure and what

213
0:13:24.840 --> 0:13:27.040
do I want to control?

214
0:13:27.040 --> 0:13:33.240
Because effectively all of the home automation is really like an input output kind of a case.

215
0:13:33.240 --> 0:13:36.320
When this happens, this other thing's supposed to happen.

216
0:13:36.320 --> 0:13:42.520
Or when I see this activity, I want some other activity to happen.

217
0:13:42.520 --> 0:13:50.440
You have to identify if you're going to choose a particular technology, is it a multi protocol

218
0:13:50.440 --> 0:13:51.440
technology?

219
0:13:51.440 --> 0:13:55.840
Does it something like matter that can operate with multiple things or is it more like a

220
0:13:55.840 --> 0:14:01.720
Phillips hub that only really controls like Phillips devices?

221
0:14:01.720 --> 0:14:03.320
You kind of see the difference.

222
0:14:03.320 --> 0:14:05.640
There's hubs that do only one protocol.

223
0:14:05.640 --> 0:14:09.400
There's some hubs that do multiple protocols.

224
0:14:09.400 --> 0:14:15.160
If you pick a technology and that technology doesn't have a sensor you need or doesn't

225
0:14:15.160 --> 0:14:19.240
have a controller you need, what are you going to do?

226
0:14:19.240 --> 0:14:26.840
For example, I needed 220 volt control of my pull pump.

227
0:14:26.840 --> 0:14:30.520
Some of these protocols don't have 220 options.

228
0:14:30.520 --> 0:14:32.520
220 volt options.

229
0:14:32.520 --> 0:14:35.400
I'm sorry, I'm living in the United States.

230
0:14:35.400 --> 0:14:37.280
Remember, everything's 110.

231
0:14:37.280 --> 0:14:38.280
You have 220.

232
0:14:38.280 --> 0:14:39.280
Everything here.

233
0:14:39.280 --> 0:14:41.040
Everything's fantastic in Europe.

234
0:14:41.040 --> 0:14:43.880
We got both.

235
0:14:43.880 --> 0:14:48.720
In my case, that was somewhat of a challenge.

236
0:14:48.720 --> 0:14:50.520
What about a thermostat?

237
0:14:50.520 --> 0:14:56.520
If you need to control a thermostat or HVAC system, does that have an interface?

238
0:14:56.520 --> 0:14:59.760
What if you want to open the garage?

239
0:14:59.760 --> 0:15:03.200
I'm going to show you later how I figured out how to figure out if the garage opens

240
0:15:03.200 --> 0:15:04.200
or shuts.

241
0:15:04.200 --> 0:15:05.200
I can figure out.

242
0:15:05.200 --> 0:15:08.000
But what about how to open it yourself?

243
0:15:08.000 --> 0:15:09.000
What's the control?

244
0:15:09.000 --> 0:15:14.560
Is your protocol support controlling garage doors?

245
0:15:14.560 --> 0:15:20.000
Chimes, that's one that's actually pretty limited.

246
0:15:20.000 --> 0:15:21.560
A lot of the interfaces don't have chimes.

247
0:15:21.560 --> 0:15:22.800
You may not think that's important.

248
0:15:22.800 --> 0:15:25.320
I use it a lot.

249
0:15:25.320 --> 0:15:27.200
Wireless remotes.

250
0:15:27.200 --> 0:15:31.520
The ability to have a wireless control for your device.

251
0:15:31.520 --> 0:15:32.520
What about a phone?

252
0:15:32.520 --> 0:15:37.480
Does it have a phone app or a phone interface?

253
0:15:37.480 --> 0:15:39.760
Of course, most of them have electrical plug controls.

254
0:15:39.760 --> 0:15:41.480
That's pretty clear.

255
0:15:41.480 --> 0:15:46.640
Again, you have to, and then there's different open source products.

256
0:15:46.640 --> 0:15:48.880
I'm actually using this thing called HeyU.

257
0:15:48.880 --> 0:15:51.240
Mr. House is very popular for home automation.

258
0:15:51.240 --> 0:15:54.120
There's a whole lot of open source home automation stuff.

259
0:15:54.120 --> 0:15:55.120
It's pretty cool.

260
0:15:55.120 --> 0:15:59.680
But my point is that you can't just jump in and say, I like the name Zigbee or I like

261
0:15:59.680 --> 0:16:05.680
the name Matter or I like the Hue light bulbs from Philips.

262
0:16:05.680 --> 0:16:11.840
You got to make sure that you're going to be able to bridge your sensors and your activity

263
0:16:11.840 --> 0:16:14.240
together under a unified system.

264
0:16:14.240 --> 0:16:16.080
Does that make sense to people?

265
0:16:16.080 --> 0:16:17.800
Does that kind of make sense?

266
0:16:17.800 --> 0:16:22.000
I guess I noticed it because I would say, oh, I really want to do X.

267
0:16:22.000 --> 0:16:23.480
Oh, I don't have a way of doing that.

268
0:16:23.480 --> 0:16:27.680
Or I really want to know X or I don't have a way of finding that out.

269
0:16:27.680 --> 0:16:28.680
That was kind of cool.

270
0:16:28.680 --> 0:16:32.040
Now, signal reliability.

271
0:16:32.040 --> 0:16:39.080
You see that a lot, some with different, like Zigbee I know has a limitation of distance

272
0:16:39.080 --> 0:16:41.080
because it's a wireless protocol.

273
0:16:41.080 --> 0:16:43.160
So again, it might use Wi-Fi.

274
0:16:43.160 --> 0:16:47.520
Do you have Wi-Fi in all parts of your home?

275
0:16:47.520 --> 0:16:48.520
They're all reachable.

276
0:16:48.520 --> 0:16:50.240
Is it reliable?

277
0:16:50.240 --> 0:16:53.320
If you're using something like X10, do you have a way of doing that?

278
0:16:53.320 --> 0:16:56.440
I'll show you how that actually works.

279
0:16:56.440 --> 0:17:00.040
What about, this kind of seems kind of unusual.

280
0:17:00.040 --> 0:17:01.040
Simplicity of device replacement.

281
0:17:01.040 --> 0:17:03.840
Why did I bring that one up?

282
0:17:03.840 --> 0:17:11.840
I had a friend, I knew a friend who when he bought a new house, he put automated outlets

283
0:17:11.840 --> 0:17:14.840
in all, all of his outlets were automated.

284
0:17:14.840 --> 0:17:21.280
So instead of the normal plug, like the normal outlet, every outlet was home automation

285
0:17:21.280 --> 0:17:22.920
enabled.

286
0:17:22.920 --> 0:17:24.600
And you're thinking, wow, guy's a genius.

287
0:17:24.600 --> 0:17:25.600
This is great.

288
0:17:25.600 --> 0:17:26.720
He's going to be able to control.

289
0:17:26.720 --> 0:17:28.320
This is probably 10 years ago.

290
0:17:28.320 --> 0:17:35.400
And he said, you know, it was kind of neat, but the reliability of the devices wasn't

291
0:17:35.400 --> 0:17:36.760
very good.

292
0:17:36.760 --> 0:17:43.800
And it feels like every one month, let's say one Saturday a month, I am replacing an outlet

293
0:17:43.800 --> 0:17:48.240
in my house.

294
0:17:48.240 --> 0:17:54.040
And I'm like, oh, that does not sound like fun because again, outlets, normal outlets

295
0:17:54.040 --> 0:18:00.440
will last for 30 or 40 years, right, is a home automation outlet going to last 30 or

296
0:18:00.440 --> 0:18:01.440
40 years?

297
0:18:01.440 --> 0:18:06.640
And even if it does, are you still going to be using that protocol 30 or 40 years from

298
0:18:06.640 --> 0:18:07.640
now?

299
0:18:07.640 --> 0:18:08.640
Right?

300
0:18:08.640 --> 0:18:12.360
I mean, think about how much it's changed even in the past five years.

301
0:18:12.360 --> 0:18:15.240
It's hard to imagine, right?

302
0:18:15.240 --> 0:18:19.000
What opportunities or what interface you're going to need 10 years from now.

303
0:18:19.000 --> 0:18:23.720
You really want to replace all the outlets in your house with a new, with either replaces

304
0:18:23.720 --> 0:18:26.440
they break or replace them.

305
0:18:26.440 --> 0:18:34.000
My brother had the Zigbee thing and he, the electricity bounced on his house and all of

306
0:18:34.000 --> 0:18:36.920
a sudden all his devices went offline.

307
0:18:36.920 --> 0:18:40.960
And we're at a dinner, I think we had, me and my cousins and my brother were having

308
0:18:40.960 --> 0:18:44.680
a dinner and he's talking about this thing and it just happened.

309
0:18:44.680 --> 0:18:48.080
And he hasn't been home yet because he went to work and happened while he was at work.

310
0:18:48.080 --> 0:18:51.600
So his wife calls, now the lights work, I can't turn on anything.

311
0:18:51.600 --> 0:18:56.720
He says, well unplug this, unplug that, plug that back in, doesn't fix it.

312
0:18:56.720 --> 0:19:02.440
And he's asking me, could a power spike when they take the electricity off and on, could

313
0:19:02.440 --> 0:19:05.000
it have wiped out like a third of his devices?

314
0:19:05.000 --> 0:19:08.480
Because a third of his device would just like go on.

315
0:19:08.480 --> 0:19:15.280
And I said, it's possible, but it's more likely it's like a hub or something.

316
0:19:15.280 --> 0:19:18.040
And it turned out he gave me the report later.

317
0:19:18.040 --> 0:19:21.520
He said I went home and I played with it for like four or five hours and I got it working

318
0:19:21.520 --> 0:19:23.200
again.

319
0:19:23.200 --> 0:19:28.280
So A, he had to be home to do it.

320
0:19:28.280 --> 0:19:32.080
His wife was not able to do it because she didn't understand the network and how it was

321
0:19:32.080 --> 0:19:33.360
set up.

322
0:19:33.360 --> 0:19:39.360
But even then I think what he ended up having to do was to hard reset one of the hubs and

323
0:19:39.360 --> 0:19:41.480
that brought all the devices back on.

324
0:19:41.480 --> 0:19:43.000
Power cycling, it didn't work.

325
0:19:43.000 --> 0:19:46.280
It seems like some part of the CMOS got whatever.

326
0:19:46.280 --> 0:19:49.120
The firmware got weird.

327
0:19:49.120 --> 0:19:53.520
But again, is that something you want to deal with in your house?

328
0:19:53.520 --> 0:19:59.520
And is that something your family wants to deal with in your house?

329
0:19:59.520 --> 0:20:07.920
So I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it's a reality is what I'm saying.

330
0:20:07.920 --> 0:20:09.040
Cost can be an issue.

331
0:20:09.040 --> 0:20:12.280
I know the Insteon stuff was fairly expensive.

332
0:20:12.280 --> 0:20:16.680
I have heard complaints about the cost of some of the Philips products, although the

333
0:20:16.680 --> 0:20:19.200
quality is very high.

334
0:20:19.200 --> 0:20:21.880
People have talked about that.

335
0:20:21.880 --> 0:20:30.680
So again, a lot of things go into that choice, longevity, ability to upgrade, that kind of

336
0:20:30.680 --> 0:20:32.240
thing.

337
0:20:32.240 --> 0:20:33.240
Very interesting.

338
0:20:33.240 --> 0:20:35.880
I don't have any answers, but very interesting.

339
0:20:35.880 --> 0:20:37.440
Any questions so far?

340
0:20:37.440 --> 0:20:38.440
Okay.

341
0:20:38.440 --> 0:20:45.080
All right, let me just dive in because this is a software conference.

342
0:20:45.080 --> 0:20:49.120
I want to give you some geeky stuff here.

343
0:20:49.120 --> 0:20:52.960
And this kind of freaked me out that this actually works.

344
0:20:52.960 --> 0:20:59.360
But it works every day without fail to the point where my family has no idea it could

345
0:20:59.360 --> 0:21:02.720
never not work.

346
0:21:02.720 --> 0:21:11.080
So about 20 years ago, I had just moved into a big house.

347
0:21:11.080 --> 0:21:14.360
And we're kind of living in a house for six months.

348
0:21:14.360 --> 0:21:15.360
Electrician was there.

349
0:21:15.360 --> 0:21:16.360
He was working on something.

350
0:21:16.360 --> 0:21:17.360
I don't know why he was there.

351
0:21:17.360 --> 0:21:18.360
I don't know why he was there.

352
0:21:18.360 --> 0:21:20.320
He was a really nice guy.

353
0:21:20.320 --> 0:21:24.680
And I said, you know, I said, can you look at something?

354
0:21:24.680 --> 0:21:29.840
My wife, there's a light at the bottom of the stairs.

355
0:21:29.840 --> 0:21:32.640
And my wife would like a switch at the top of the stairs.

356
0:21:32.640 --> 0:21:34.520
She can turn the light on.

357
0:21:34.520 --> 0:21:35.720
You're going down the stairs at night.

358
0:21:35.720 --> 0:21:38.320
You want to be able to turn the light on as you're walking down the stairs.

359
0:21:38.320 --> 0:21:40.000
It makes perfect sense.

360
0:21:40.000 --> 0:21:43.000
So I asked the guy, I said, can you put a switch here?

361
0:21:43.000 --> 0:21:47.360
He's like, well, he said, I can.

362
0:21:47.360 --> 0:21:49.360
But the problem is the light's downstairs.

363
0:21:49.360 --> 0:21:51.260
The switch is on the wall downstairs.

364
0:21:51.260 --> 0:21:58.640
So I'd have to open the wall and then the ceiling to get the wire up to the wall on

365
0:21:58.640 --> 0:22:02.920
the second floor to put the switch in.

366
0:22:02.920 --> 0:22:05.240
I'm like, well, I don't think we want it that much.

367
0:22:05.240 --> 0:22:07.400
I don't think it's that important.

368
0:22:07.400 --> 0:22:10.760
He said, have you thought about X10?

369
0:22:10.760 --> 0:22:13.040
I'm like, I said, I've heard of it.

370
0:22:13.040 --> 0:22:14.320
I said, does it really work?

371
0:22:14.320 --> 0:22:16.360
And he said, actually it does.

372
0:22:16.360 --> 0:22:17.920
He said, I put it in my house.

373
0:22:17.920 --> 0:22:20.720
And it actually works really well.

374
0:22:20.720 --> 0:22:25.000
But he said, also, he said, I've talked to my customers about it.

375
0:22:25.000 --> 0:22:30.720
And particularly when I'm doing new construction, I can basically install it while I'm working

376
0:22:30.720 --> 0:22:31.880
on their stuff.

377
0:22:31.880 --> 0:22:37.120
And he said, every person I've talked to, I give them the quota, the price.

378
0:22:37.120 --> 0:22:43.200
It's like $600 to add some home automation to maybe the lights outside or whatever.

379
0:22:43.200 --> 0:22:47.160
But every customer I've talked to has said no.

380
0:22:47.160 --> 0:22:49.400
So he said, I use it.

381
0:22:49.400 --> 0:22:53.760
But everyone I try and recommend it to, they're like, oh, I don't want the headache.

382
0:22:53.760 --> 0:22:55.120
I don't want to pay the $600.

383
0:22:55.120 --> 0:22:56.560
I don't see the value.

384
0:22:56.560 --> 0:23:02.920
These are the kind of things that the feedback that he as an electrician got.

385
0:23:02.920 --> 0:23:05.400
So let me show you how it works.

386
0:23:05.400 --> 0:23:09.400
And we can kind of walk through it and sort of see.

387
0:23:09.400 --> 0:23:17.120
So this is, and I apologize if there's any US specific electrical things in here.

388
0:23:17.120 --> 0:23:18.960
I'm going to do my best.

389
0:23:18.960 --> 0:23:24.920
So this is basically the sine wave for electricity.

390
0:23:24.920 --> 0:23:30.600
I believe this is a US cycle here because I think it's 60 hertz.

391
0:23:30.600 --> 0:23:34.400
And in Europe, it would be 50 hertz, right?

392
0:23:34.400 --> 0:23:38.440
So you just pretend it's not that.

393
0:23:38.440 --> 0:23:42.300
So basically, the electricity goes up and down like this.

394
0:23:42.300 --> 0:23:44.680
This is alternating current.

395
0:23:44.680 --> 0:23:45.680
Pretty straightforward.

396
0:23:45.680 --> 0:23:46.680
This is positive volt.

397
0:23:46.680 --> 0:23:48.800
This is negative volt.

398
0:23:48.800 --> 0:23:52.000
And then the target is 115 roughly in the US.

399
0:23:52.000 --> 0:23:55.280
And it just goes back and forth.

400
0:23:55.280 --> 0:24:07.600
What they figured out in the 80s is that when the electricity crosses the zero voltage point,

401
0:24:07.600 --> 0:24:15.400
they could inject a small signal, like a blip at a certain frequency, and have it travel

402
0:24:15.400 --> 0:24:20.920
along the entire wiring of your house.

403
0:24:20.920 --> 0:24:26.600
So I'm not sure how many of you are aware that, for example, you can run ethernet over

404
0:24:26.600 --> 0:24:27.960
coax now.

405
0:24:27.960 --> 0:24:28.960
It's called Mocha.

406
0:24:28.960 --> 0:24:33.040
And it's basically, if you have coax in your house, you can run ethernet.

407
0:24:33.040 --> 0:24:35.480
So I have a TV in the family room.

408
0:24:35.480 --> 0:24:38.480
I don't have ethernet out there, but I have a coax.

409
0:24:38.480 --> 0:24:41.600
So in the basement, I have a Mocha adapter.

410
0:24:41.600 --> 0:24:43.100
Ethernet plugs in.

411
0:24:43.100 --> 0:24:44.120
Out comes the coax.

412
0:24:44.120 --> 0:24:46.880
The coax goes through the whole house.

413
0:24:46.880 --> 0:24:48.560
Gets picked up in the family room.

414
0:24:48.560 --> 0:24:50.440
I have another Mocha adapter.

415
0:24:50.440 --> 0:24:51.920
In comes coax.

416
0:24:51.920 --> 0:24:52.920
Out comes ethernet.

417
0:24:52.920 --> 0:24:55.120
Goes right into the TV.

418
0:24:55.120 --> 0:24:59.980
So the same way that you can run ethernet over coax, you can run home automation over

419
0:24:59.980 --> 0:25:02.880
an electrical system.

420
0:25:02.880 --> 0:25:03.920
Crazy but true.

421
0:25:03.920 --> 0:25:08.920
So here we have a signal blip right here.

422
0:25:08.920 --> 0:25:10.320
Here's a zero.

423
0:25:10.320 --> 0:25:12.120
So this will be a one.

424
0:25:12.120 --> 0:25:13.760
We're getting back to binary here.

425
0:25:13.760 --> 0:25:15.080
Very exciting.

426
0:25:15.080 --> 0:25:16.080
People are salivating.

427
0:25:16.080 --> 0:25:17.080
So here's a zero.

428
0:25:17.080 --> 0:25:18.640
Here's a one.

429
0:25:18.640 --> 0:25:20.360
Here's a zero.

430
0:25:20.360 --> 0:25:21.360
Here's a zero.

431
0:25:21.360 --> 0:25:22.360
Here's a one.

432
0:25:22.360 --> 0:25:24.480
Here's a zero.

433
0:25:24.480 --> 0:25:29.640
And if you think of, now we're starting to see where we're going here, you can see this

434
0:25:29.640 --> 0:25:36.880
is 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1.

435
0:25:36.880 --> 0:25:40.880
So what they effectively did, these people in the 80s weren't idiots.

436
0:25:40.880 --> 0:25:46.440
They basically had a binary code for different house codes.

437
0:25:46.440 --> 0:25:51.280
It goes from A to P. So this is the binary code for A. I know it's not ASCII.

438
0:25:51.280 --> 0:25:53.520
It's just whatever it is.

439
0:25:53.520 --> 0:25:57.440
They did have ASCII back then, but stick with me here.

440
0:25:57.440 --> 0:26:02.400
This is A. This is B. This is C. This is D. And these are the patterns for the different

441
0:26:02.400 --> 0:26:03.440
house codes.

442
0:26:03.440 --> 0:26:09.360
So if you want, so actually here's a sine wave on what device is this?

443
0:26:09.360 --> 0:26:10.360
Anyone?

444
0:26:10.360 --> 0:26:11.480
All right.

445
0:26:11.480 --> 0:26:12.480
People know what that's called.

446
0:26:12.480 --> 0:26:13.480
That's good.

447
0:26:13.480 --> 0:26:14.480
Oscilloscope.

448
0:26:14.480 --> 0:26:15.480
Yes.

449
0:26:15.480 --> 0:26:16.480
I'm not that old.

450
0:26:16.480 --> 0:26:17.480
People remember.

451
0:26:17.480 --> 0:26:18.480
Yes.

452
0:26:18.480 --> 0:26:19.480
This is an oscilloscope right here.

453
0:26:19.480 --> 0:26:21.280
And you can see that's the way it used to look.

454
0:26:21.280 --> 0:26:26.160
And it was, Tektronix was the big manufacturer of these, I remember.

455
0:26:26.160 --> 0:26:33.320
And here is an oscilloscope showing those little blips in the crossing of the zero voltage.

456
0:26:33.320 --> 0:26:34.320
Okay.

457
0:26:34.320 --> 0:26:38.240
So that's literally, and we can thank, I believe I have a website that lists where I got this

458
0:26:38.240 --> 0:26:39.240
from.

459
0:26:39.240 --> 0:26:41.480
And it's kind of cool that you can just kind of link like that.

460
0:26:41.480 --> 0:26:42.480
Okay.

461
0:26:42.480 --> 0:26:44.080
So that's two ones right there.

462
0:26:44.080 --> 0:26:45.320
Okay.

463
0:26:45.320 --> 0:26:50.680
So the X10 standard basically, actually, forget the 1980s.

464
0:26:50.680 --> 0:26:56.800
1975 was the standard was made in Scotland.

465
0:26:56.800 --> 0:27:00.040
It didn't really become popular, I think, till the 80s.

466
0:27:00.040 --> 0:27:02.920
Uses the 120 hertz carrier.

467
0:27:02.920 --> 0:27:06.200
And again, that's two 60-carat cycles in the US.

468
0:27:06.200 --> 0:27:11.000
I believe they also have them in Europe for European things.

469
0:27:11.000 --> 0:27:14.080
So one bit is transmitted per zero crossing.

470
0:27:14.080 --> 0:27:16.080
120 bits a second.

471
0:27:16.080 --> 0:27:17.200
There you go.

472
0:27:17.200 --> 0:27:18.580
You thought modems were bad.

473
0:27:18.580 --> 0:27:20.200
This one's really bad.

474
0:27:20.200 --> 0:27:23.800
256 maximum devices on your network.

475
0:27:23.800 --> 0:27:24.800
16 house codes.

476
0:27:24.800 --> 0:27:27.080
Each house code has 16 devices.

477
0:27:27.080 --> 0:27:29.520
And again, there's the standard right there.

478
0:27:29.520 --> 0:27:30.600
Okay.

479
0:27:30.600 --> 0:27:33.760
So this is what it would look like, the protocol for that.

480
0:27:33.760 --> 0:27:35.720
This would be the start code.

481
0:27:35.720 --> 0:27:37.520
This is the house code.

482
0:27:37.520 --> 0:27:39.760
And this is the device number.

483
0:27:39.760 --> 0:27:46.340
And then you would say on or off or dim or whatever you want that device to do.

484
0:27:46.340 --> 0:27:48.880
This is how you control it.

485
0:27:48.880 --> 0:27:49.880
Okay.

486
0:27:49.880 --> 0:27:52.280
This is the full protocol.

487
0:27:52.280 --> 0:27:54.400
So here are our house codes.

488
0:27:54.400 --> 0:27:57.020
Here are device numbers up to 16.

489
0:27:57.020 --> 0:27:59.080
And here are commands.

490
0:27:59.080 --> 0:28:04.040
So it looks like there's about 16 commands.

491
0:28:04.040 --> 0:28:06.640
There's brightness, dimness, on or off.

492
0:28:06.640 --> 0:28:07.720
These are the big ones right here.

493
0:28:07.720 --> 0:28:08.720
These four.

494
0:28:08.720 --> 0:28:10.920
These four are the ones you see the most.

495
0:28:10.920 --> 0:28:12.440
Okay.

496
0:28:12.440 --> 0:28:16.760
Crazy but really cool that they got this to work.

497
0:28:16.760 --> 0:28:25.160
Obviously one of the problems is you need like three-quarters of a second to send a

498
0:28:25.160 --> 0:28:26.680
signal.

499
0:28:26.680 --> 0:28:29.800
And those of you who are really smart will realize that's kind of slow.

500
0:28:29.800 --> 0:28:32.800
It's because you always send a signal twice.

501
0:28:32.800 --> 0:28:39.000
Because electrical systems can be noisy and therefore if the same signal appears twice

502
0:28:39.000 --> 0:28:41.240
then you know that that's the valid signal.

503
0:28:41.240 --> 0:28:42.240
Okay.

504
0:28:42.240 --> 0:28:43.240
So it's sent twice.

505
0:28:43.240 --> 0:28:44.240
Poor propagation.

506
0:28:44.240 --> 0:28:48.600
The United States uses split phase systems.

507
0:28:48.600 --> 0:28:50.000
I'll talk about that in a minute.

508
0:28:50.000 --> 0:28:54.560
I don't think Europe has that problem but that there's an issue there.

509
0:28:54.560 --> 0:28:58.760
Line noise can be a problem and other buildings can also probably be a problem.

510
0:28:58.760 --> 0:28:59.760
Okay.

511
0:28:59.760 --> 0:29:03.440
So this is what a house typically looks like.

512
0:29:03.440 --> 0:29:09.440
You've got a 220 coming in but basically it's positive 110 and negative 110 and then you

513
0:29:09.440 --> 0:29:10.440
have two phases.

514
0:29:10.440 --> 0:29:14.960
You have a positive phase and then a negative phase over here.

515
0:29:14.960 --> 0:29:19.440
And that's typically the way that houses or in the United States at least are built.

516
0:29:19.440 --> 0:29:27.040
One of the problems of course is that because you have split phase it's hard to get signal

517
0:29:27.040 --> 0:29:31.640
from one side of the phase to the other so they have something called a signal coupler

518
0:29:31.640 --> 0:29:35.680
which basically transmits that blip between the two.

519
0:29:35.680 --> 0:29:36.680
Okay.

520
0:29:36.680 --> 0:29:37.680
Phase coupling.

521
0:29:37.680 --> 0:29:39.040
Let's just do that.

522
0:29:39.040 --> 0:29:43.840
You can filter stuff so you can filter out line noise if you want.

523
0:29:43.840 --> 0:29:45.680
So let's look at the actual devices.

524
0:29:45.680 --> 0:29:46.680
This is a switch right here.

525
0:29:46.680 --> 0:29:47.680
This is a normal switch.

526
0:29:47.680 --> 0:29:49.480
This is an X10 switch.

527
0:29:49.480 --> 0:29:54.280
Notice there's no up or down because it's just a button because you may have turned

528
0:29:54.280 --> 0:29:56.720
it on remotely.

529
0:29:56.720 --> 0:29:59.080
So we don't have a status to it.

530
0:29:59.080 --> 0:30:00.080
There's no physical status.

531
0:30:00.080 --> 0:30:01.080
You push it.

532
0:30:01.080 --> 0:30:02.080
So on you push it.

533
0:30:02.080 --> 0:30:03.080
It's off.

534
0:30:03.080 --> 0:30:04.960
Okay.

535
0:30:04.960 --> 0:30:10.080
You might be thinking, oh gee, why would I want a button like when I have home automation?

536
0:30:10.080 --> 0:30:16.240
And the funniest story I can tell you is that if home automation had started first and we

537
0:30:16.240 --> 0:30:24.600
never had physical buttons and physical buttons showed up people would think they were genius.

538
0:30:24.600 --> 0:30:28.400
Because physical buttons are really convenient.

539
0:30:28.400 --> 0:30:30.720
Let me tell you how convenient they are.

540
0:30:30.720 --> 0:30:36.900
My nephew lives in New York City, rehabbed the whole house, decided he was going to go

541
0:30:36.900 --> 0:30:42.160
full with home automation, put in physical light switches but decided I'm not going to

542
0:30:42.160 --> 0:30:43.160
use them.

543
0:30:43.160 --> 0:30:49.880
I'm just going to use the Phillips or the Z-Wave Zigbee bulbs.

544
0:30:49.880 --> 0:30:53.520
So if you're going to use the Zigbee bulbs and you control them remotely you effectively

545
0:30:53.520 --> 0:30:56.520
have to always give them power.

546
0:30:56.520 --> 0:30:58.800
So the switch, you've got to leave it on all the time.

547
0:30:58.800 --> 0:31:02.760
If you turn it off it can't turn on anymore and flipping a switch doesn't work.

548
0:31:02.760 --> 0:31:04.640
It doesn't do anything.

549
0:31:04.640 --> 0:31:08.960
So what he decided he was going to do is every time he was going to control it with voice

550
0:31:08.960 --> 0:31:16.400
controls so when he walks in the room he says echo lights on and he leaves.

551
0:31:16.400 --> 0:31:20.760
He says echo lights off and echo lights on and echo lights off.

552
0:31:20.760 --> 0:31:24.440
I was there in the fall and I said how's it going?

553
0:31:24.440 --> 0:31:28.840
He said you know we're getting tired of talking all the time.

554
0:31:28.840 --> 0:31:37.040
He said you know I thought it was really cool but after a while it gets kind of annoying.

555
0:31:37.040 --> 0:31:42.400
So I think he's going to have to rethink that whole home automation lack of switch control

556
0:31:42.400 --> 0:31:43.560
thing.

557
0:31:43.560 --> 0:31:46.200
So there's what physical switch.

558
0:31:46.200 --> 0:31:52.120
What I'm saying is don't dismiss the light switches as completely useless.

559
0:31:52.120 --> 0:31:54.120
There actually is some use to that.

560
0:31:54.120 --> 0:31:56.080
Here's a different type of switch.

561
0:31:56.080 --> 0:31:57.720
It's a flat switch.

562
0:31:57.720 --> 0:32:00.160
More modern basically.

563
0:32:00.160 --> 0:32:04.360
Three way switches you can do those with X10 as well so that's actually a three way switch

564
0:32:04.360 --> 0:32:05.360
right there.

565
0:32:05.360 --> 0:32:06.360
No actually this is a three way.

566
0:32:06.360 --> 0:32:09.880
They're all three way switches actually these three.

567
0:32:09.880 --> 0:32:12.120
You can do this which is kind of cool.

568
0:32:12.120 --> 0:32:14.200
It's basically there's nothing behind this.

569
0:32:14.200 --> 0:32:17.360
This is just stuck on the wall.

570
0:32:17.360 --> 0:32:20.480
So it's basically a wireless remote.

571
0:32:20.480 --> 0:32:21.760
You just hit the button.

572
0:32:21.760 --> 0:32:22.760
You stick it.

573
0:32:22.760 --> 0:32:24.640
This is how I fix the problem coming down the stairs.

574
0:32:24.640 --> 0:32:29.200
I just stuck one of these on the wall and then every two years I replace the little

575
0:32:29.200 --> 0:32:31.320
battery that's in it like this big.

576
0:32:31.320 --> 0:32:33.800
So I go around the whole house just replace all the batteries every two years.

577
0:32:33.800 --> 0:32:35.680
It works really well.

578
0:32:35.680 --> 0:32:42.360
This is the adapter that basically receives the signal from the wireless if you have that.

579
0:32:42.360 --> 0:32:46.080
It's another wireless device that we have little buttons do those whatever you want.

580
0:32:46.080 --> 0:32:47.800
You control it.

581
0:32:47.800 --> 0:32:50.080
This is a four device model.

582
0:32:50.080 --> 0:32:52.720
There's also a 16 device model right here.

583
0:32:52.720 --> 0:32:56.120
So this one right here and this is a lamp and you can see here's a good setup.

584
0:32:56.120 --> 0:32:57.520
Here's the lamp.

585
0:32:57.520 --> 0:33:01.480
Here's the X10 module plugged into the into the outlet.

586
0:33:01.480 --> 0:33:02.480
OK.

587
0:33:02.480 --> 0:33:05.720
And then and then and basically this goes up and goes to this right.

588
0:33:05.720 --> 0:33:10.640
So this is an X10 controller and it does up to 16 devices.

589
0:33:10.640 --> 0:33:14.480
So again you need one two devices four devices 16 devices.

590
0:33:14.480 --> 0:33:18.400
You can pick a different remote that does that for you.

591
0:33:18.400 --> 0:33:20.400
OK.

592
0:33:20.400 --> 0:33:26.040
So I think this is kind of a good example where you'll notice I did not get outlets

593
0:33:26.040 --> 0:33:27.160
that no X10.

594
0:33:27.160 --> 0:33:28.800
I just got plug in things.

595
0:33:28.800 --> 0:33:30.360
Why did I do that.

596
0:33:30.360 --> 0:33:36.480
I don't want to spend one Saturday a month like pulling out my outlets and fixing them.

597
0:33:36.480 --> 0:33:40.720
They've been very reliable but at the same time I may not stay with this technology.

598
0:33:40.720 --> 0:33:42.880
I don't necessarily want to rip everything out.

599
0:33:42.880 --> 0:33:45.880
I don't mind seeing a little white box there.

600
0:33:45.880 --> 0:33:49.880
It's easier for me and if something doesn't work I can just plug another one in and debug

601
0:33:49.880 --> 0:33:51.400
it like real quick.

602
0:33:51.400 --> 0:33:52.400
Right.

603
0:33:52.400 --> 0:33:56.320
Because it may not may not be the bug maybe the box it just makes you really.

604
0:33:56.320 --> 0:33:57.320
OK.

605
0:33:57.320 --> 0:33:58.320
OK.

606
0:33:58.320 --> 0:33:59.320
Pool pump.

607
0:33:59.320 --> 0:34:00.720
I talked about this.

608
0:34:00.720 --> 0:34:04.200
Basically I have a pool and I want to turn the pump on.

609
0:34:04.200 --> 0:34:06.960
Basically this is done with the big timer dial.

610
0:34:06.960 --> 0:34:11.360
Remember we talked about the timers with the little dial and you know it goes around every

611
0:34:11.360 --> 0:34:13.120
24 hours.

612
0:34:13.120 --> 0:34:18.520
The problem with that is that I want the pump to run more when it's hot and less when it's

613
0:34:18.520 --> 0:34:22.680
not hot because the hotter it is the longer you have to run the pump.

614
0:34:22.680 --> 0:34:27.280
So by controlling it and this is right here this little X10 switch right here.

615
0:34:27.280 --> 0:34:28.280
Right.

616
0:34:28.280 --> 0:34:32.720
In this little box you can basically figure out what how warm is it outside.

617
0:34:32.720 --> 0:34:37.680
You ask the weather service how warm is it outside and then depending on how warm it

618
0:34:37.680 --> 0:34:40.480
is that's how long the pump runs.

619
0:34:40.480 --> 0:34:44.400
And my pool people will come and they'll say you should sell this.

620
0:34:44.400 --> 0:34:50.120
I'm like well I could but then I have to have a controller and I have to have some way of

621
0:34:50.120 --> 0:34:57.160
programming it to get the weather and it's not what I found it's very hard to to productize

622
0:34:57.160 --> 0:35:03.720
a lot of the home automation stuff in general because everyone's need is different and to

623
0:35:03.720 --> 0:35:08.360
prioritize it it's kind of it's kind of difficult.

624
0:35:08.360 --> 0:35:15.280
This is a command open source program called Hey You which actually controls X10.

625
0:35:15.280 --> 0:35:19.120
I've used this I guess since I've been using X10.

626
0:35:19.120 --> 0:35:26.760
There basically is an interface between the electric plug right there and a serial cable.

627
0:35:26.760 --> 0:35:33.720
A serial that comes out here and goes over to here where my server is right here.

628
0:35:33.720 --> 0:35:40.720
OK so this goes out and then I think currently it goes into a little USB adapter which converts

629
0:35:40.720 --> 0:35:47.840
serial to USB and then the USB goes in and Linux has no trouble communicating serial

630
0:35:47.840 --> 0:35:49.000
to that.

631
0:35:49.000 --> 0:35:52.400
So you can see the sort of network interface between right.

632
0:35:52.400 --> 0:35:59.920
You've gone from Linux to USB to serial and then to power to X10.

633
0:35:59.920 --> 0:36:00.920
Kind of interesting.

634
0:36:00.920 --> 0:36:01.920
OK.

635
0:36:01.920 --> 0:36:07.760
I can monitor what's happening so here is a report of what has happened at the house

636
0:36:07.760 --> 0:36:12.320
all of the activity that's happened so I can basically say OK this is happening this is

637
0:36:12.320 --> 0:36:17.640
happening this is happening and I can look and get a log of that.

638
0:36:17.640 --> 0:36:24.760
This is a shell bash script that I wrote which effectively monitors what happens in X10 and

639
0:36:24.760 --> 0:36:29.360
then it takes different actions depending on what happens.

640
0:36:29.360 --> 0:36:32.760
So if somebody does one thing I say go do this other thing.

641
0:36:32.760 --> 0:36:33.760
Is it too late?

642
0:36:33.760 --> 0:36:34.760
Do this other thing.

643
0:36:34.760 --> 0:36:36.880
Don't do it if it's too late in the day.

644
0:36:36.880 --> 0:36:38.880
People might be asleep.

645
0:36:38.880 --> 0:36:40.480
Are we ready to eat?

646
0:36:40.480 --> 0:36:42.200
There's all these things that happen.

647
0:36:42.200 --> 0:36:48.560
For example when somebody hits a button in the kitchen it sends a message to all of the

648
0:36:48.560 --> 0:36:52.280
terminals and all the laptops in the house saying it's time to eat.

649
0:36:52.280 --> 0:36:54.760
There's a slide show in the kitchen.

650
0:36:54.760 --> 0:36:58.400
Big batter comes up time to eat for 20 seconds.

651
0:36:58.400 --> 0:37:01.960
And there's also an X10 chime.

652
0:37:01.960 --> 0:37:06.200
So there's little X10 modules that make like a little ding dong sound like a doorbell.

653
0:37:06.200 --> 0:37:09.840
And I put them in different parts of the house so when they press it there's this little

654
0:37:09.840 --> 0:37:11.780
ding dong you hear different parts of the house.

655
0:37:11.780 --> 0:37:13.200
And then it's time to eat.

656
0:37:13.200 --> 0:37:18.640
I tried it first just making one really loud sound that didn't work well.

657
0:37:18.640 --> 0:37:22.400
Because when you were in the room it made the loud sound it was very annoying and when

658
0:37:22.400 --> 0:37:24.280
you were far away you didn't hear it.

659
0:37:24.280 --> 0:37:27.520
So to do that I had to kind of spread it out.

660
0:37:27.520 --> 0:37:31.420
So again you're looking at some input and you're looking at some output and that's kind

661
0:37:31.420 --> 0:37:36.960
of the way you have to think of it.

662
0:37:36.960 --> 0:37:38.640
So what inputs do I use?

663
0:37:38.640 --> 0:37:40.760
I use the time of day.

664
0:37:40.760 --> 0:37:44.560
I have dust on sensors to know how light it is outside.

665
0:37:44.560 --> 0:37:46.360
I use wireless remotes.

666
0:37:46.360 --> 0:37:47.360
I use caller ID.

667
0:37:47.360 --> 0:37:49.480
I'll talk about that in a minute.

668
0:37:49.480 --> 0:37:54.160
I even have telephone dialing so I can actually I don't know if you're familiar with modems

669
0:37:54.160 --> 0:37:58.640
but you can still buy modems and you can make them dial the telephone.

670
0:37:58.640 --> 0:38:03.440
So you can have like a instead of dialing it yourself you can tell the computer take

671
0:38:03.440 --> 0:38:08.000
this address book entry and dial it and I'll just pick up the phone and talk to them.

672
0:38:08.000 --> 0:38:10.940
So it kind of makes it convenient for people.

673
0:38:10.940 --> 0:38:15.240
Even things like outside temperature you can get from websites.

674
0:38:15.240 --> 0:38:16.240
And then outputs.

675
0:38:16.240 --> 0:38:17.640
We can do lights.

676
0:38:17.640 --> 0:38:20.140
We can turn on motors like the pool pump.

677
0:38:20.140 --> 0:38:22.160
We can do appliances like the coffee maker.

678
0:38:22.160 --> 0:38:24.400
I'll tell you that when we get there.

679
0:38:24.400 --> 0:38:25.840
I can make sounds.

680
0:38:25.840 --> 0:38:31.120
I can make broadcast messages on the laptops and I can even have a slideshow have a big

681
0:38:31.120 --> 0:38:36.480
screen to say time to eat or somebody's arrived in the garage.

682
0:38:36.480 --> 0:38:41.800
This is maybe overwhelming but it's basically a lot of the first floor of my house.

683
0:38:41.800 --> 0:38:44.600
Here's the server right here.

684
0:38:44.600 --> 0:38:48.880
So remember I show you that little adapter the serial adapter with the X 10 that's right

685
0:38:48.880 --> 0:38:51.280
that's number four.

686
0:38:51.280 --> 0:38:56.320
Here are the yellows are lights that are controlled.

687
0:38:56.320 --> 0:38:58.760
Here is the sunset sensor.

688
0:38:58.760 --> 0:39:01.760
Here is yeah.

689
0:39:01.760 --> 0:39:03.200
So this is where you have a remote.

690
0:39:03.200 --> 0:39:06.960
You can tell people to do stuff.

691
0:39:06.960 --> 0:39:09.520
One of the interesting things you'll notice that the lights at the front of the house

692
0:39:09.520 --> 0:39:12.440
you see all these these lights right here.

693
0:39:12.440 --> 0:39:16.360
They turn on right before dusk right when it's getting dark.

694
0:39:16.360 --> 0:39:21.600
But what I realized is that why would I turn the lights on always at the same intensity

695
0:39:21.600 --> 0:39:23.600
every day.

696
0:39:23.600 --> 0:39:28.320
What I'll do is I'll randomly have different intensity lights every time I turn them on.

697
0:39:28.320 --> 0:39:32.320
So if you look at my house one day maybe the maybe the garage will be brighter and the

698
0:39:32.320 --> 0:39:36.640
front door will be dimmer and the next day the porch will be brighter and the front door

699
0:39:36.640 --> 0:39:39.320
will be brighter and the garage will be dimmer.

700
0:39:39.320 --> 0:39:45.320
So just adds a little bit of variety to how people view your house and kind of looks like

701
0:39:45.320 --> 0:39:46.320
a neat little thing.

702
0:39:46.320 --> 0:39:50.040
I think it's kind of cool.

703
0:39:50.040 --> 0:39:51.040
Let's see here.

704
0:39:51.040 --> 0:39:52.040
Yeah.

705
0:39:52.040 --> 0:39:57.960
So this is basically this is walking you through how you know how the system works.

706
0:39:57.960 --> 0:40:00.840
I think it's I think it's kind of interesting.

707
0:40:00.840 --> 0:40:03.160
Any questions.

708
0:40:03.160 --> 0:40:07.760
Yes sir.

709
0:40:07.760 --> 0:40:10.800
So the question is does the X10 link to your neighbors as well.

710
0:40:10.800 --> 0:40:17.380
So technically X10 will will broadcast up until your transformer.

711
0:40:17.380 --> 0:40:23.400
If you're familiar with the transformer it turns out that my run goes right from my house

712
0:40:23.400 --> 0:40:24.800
to the transformer.

713
0:40:24.800 --> 0:40:28.000
So I don't have other people between me and the transformer so I don't think anyone else

714
0:40:28.000 --> 0:40:29.000
sees it.

715
0:40:29.000 --> 0:40:35.400
However if you're sharing a transformer with other people on the same wire they will absolutely

716
0:40:35.400 --> 0:40:38.520
see it and that's why they have the house codes.

717
0:40:38.520 --> 0:40:41.960
So if you find that somebody's using your house code you may switch to a different house

718
0:40:41.960 --> 0:40:45.120
code and therefore you will not see interference from them.

719
0:40:45.120 --> 0:40:46.120
Great question.

720
0:40:46.120 --> 0:40:47.120
OK.

721
0:40:47.120 --> 0:40:48.120
Yes.

722
0:40:48.120 --> 0:40:52.600
Can you have a filter in your mains.

723
0:40:52.600 --> 0:40:57.200
Absolutely they sell filters that will filter your mains and therefore it doesn't leak out

724
0:40:57.200 --> 0:40:58.200
to the rest of the house.

725
0:40:58.200 --> 0:40:59.200
Yeah.

726
0:40:59.200 --> 0:41:00.200
Great question.

727
0:41:00.200 --> 0:41:02.200
I'm going to keep going here.

728
0:41:02.200 --> 0:41:07.920
So I promise I was going to talk about what success looks like.

729
0:41:07.920 --> 0:41:14.360
Basically adding home automation changes your family's home environment.

730
0:41:14.360 --> 0:41:16.320
Good or bad.

731
0:41:16.320 --> 0:41:18.160
Right.

732
0:41:18.160 --> 0:41:26.600
I recommend you start slow because my brother he had seen me do it and he kind of went all

733
0:41:26.600 --> 0:41:28.000
in.

734
0:41:28.000 --> 0:41:34.400
But the reaction I got from I just talked to my wife last night and she was at a funeral.

735
0:41:34.400 --> 0:41:39.240
My uncle actually had a funeral on Friday that I unfortunately missed but she was talking

736
0:41:39.240 --> 0:41:46.720
to my sister in law and she was complaining about the fact that when she does not know

737
0:41:46.720 --> 0:41:52.400
how to control the lights in the house there are different voice commands and she can't

738
0:41:52.400 --> 0:42:00.200
remember what she what my brother called that device and she it's my brother.

739
0:42:00.200 --> 0:42:01.200
I don't know.

740
0:42:01.200 --> 0:42:04.280
I would have I told maybe we put labels on things so you can remember what we called

741
0:42:04.280 --> 0:42:06.040
them for the voice commands.

742
0:42:06.040 --> 0:42:11.840
But it's not a good situation to be in when your family is feeling like they don't have

743
0:42:11.840 --> 0:42:15.160
control because it's their house too.

744
0:42:15.160 --> 0:42:19.400
And they want to feel like they certainly should feel comfortable in controlling their

745
0:42:19.400 --> 0:42:24.900
environment and if you kind of come in too strong you can bypass them.

746
0:42:24.900 --> 0:42:32.920
So in fact my trick was that I put in home automation just for the outside lights.

747
0:42:32.920 --> 0:42:34.040
OK.

748
0:42:34.040 --> 0:42:41.080
And my wife like two month later she said can you do this one lamp for me.

749
0:42:41.080 --> 0:42:42.160
I said sure.

750
0:42:42.160 --> 0:42:46.280
And I waited like four weeks and I was really excited to do it but I'm like I'm going to

751
0:42:46.280 --> 0:42:50.480
wait a couple of weeks and then I did it because I didn't want to feel like I just was trying

752
0:42:50.480 --> 0:42:52.000
to move it too fast.

753
0:42:52.000 --> 0:42:56.920
So it's been very incremental and that has allowed people to look at it as a positive

754
0:42:56.920 --> 0:43:00.440
versus I think sometimes can look at as a negative.

755
0:43:00.440 --> 0:43:01.440
OK.

756
0:43:01.440 --> 0:43:07.120
Except that some home automation tests are impossible and again you've succeeded when

757
0:43:07.120 --> 0:43:10.640
a family member asks for home automation edition.

758
0:43:10.640 --> 0:43:13.160
That is your gold standard.

759
0:43:13.160 --> 0:43:19.560
Try and keep an eye on that one because if you don't get there I would say you're kind

760
0:43:19.560 --> 0:43:22.080
of full and this is actually a great article.

761
0:43:22.080 --> 0:43:24.360
Smart home gadgets still a hard sell.

762
0:43:24.360 --> 0:43:27.760
Wall Street Journal article right there.

763
0:43:27.760 --> 0:43:28.920
So challenges.

764
0:43:28.920 --> 0:43:30.280
Change is hard.

765
0:43:30.280 --> 0:43:31.780
Reliability.

766
0:43:31.780 --> 0:43:36.920
So sometimes it's hard for family members to understand how it's working.

767
0:43:36.920 --> 0:43:39.040
Device longevity I talked about that.

768
0:43:39.040 --> 0:43:42.140
Maintenance I talked about what happens if something breaks right.

769
0:43:42.140 --> 0:43:46.760
The cost I talked about that and of course security privacy are also important.

770
0:43:46.760 --> 0:43:52.200
And again we have a nice talk about the Nest thermostat bug leaves users in the cold.

771
0:43:52.200 --> 0:43:54.260
Not a good not a good experience there.

772
0:43:54.260 --> 0:43:58.560
So be aware it's it it's scary sometimes.

773
0:43:58.560 --> 0:43:59.840
OK.

774
0:43:59.840 --> 0:44:03.080
So let's just run through this and I'm going to take some questions.

775
0:44:03.080 --> 0:44:06.280
So this is mostly just a Q&A part.

776
0:44:06.280 --> 0:44:08.120
I mean show and tell.

777
0:44:08.120 --> 0:44:14.380
So here are the modems I use where it actually again serial cables going up to USB.

778
0:44:14.380 --> 0:44:19.240
But I have two phone lines and it's just modems they can not only can I dial the number but

779
0:44:19.240 --> 0:44:24.140
I can get caller ID so I can get caller ID and show everyone in the house who's calling

780
0:44:24.140 --> 0:44:25.140
on the phone.

781
0:44:25.140 --> 0:44:26.140
Right.

782
0:44:26.140 --> 0:44:27.760
You don't have to look at the phone you see it on your computer.

783
0:44:27.760 --> 0:44:29.720
Really kind of nice.

784
0:44:29.720 --> 0:44:32.560
This is I can log all the telephone calls coming in.

785
0:44:32.560 --> 0:44:35.840
All right.

786
0:44:35.840 --> 0:44:39.000
I can dial the phone as I said before.

787
0:44:39.000 --> 0:44:44.320
Again I use caller ID to broadcast messages and to make it shine if it's somebody important

788
0:44:44.320 --> 0:44:45.960
like a family member.

789
0:44:45.960 --> 0:44:47.040
OK.

790
0:44:47.040 --> 0:44:51.760
And I end up taking the caller ID I look it up in my telephone directory and then I know

791
0:44:51.760 --> 0:44:57.040
who it is and I can actually give a text message instead of just a number I can customize what

792
0:44:57.040 --> 0:44:58.040
it looks like.

793
0:44:58.040 --> 0:44:59.040
OK.

794
0:44:59.040 --> 0:45:01.560
I can make outgoing calls as I said before.

795
0:45:01.560 --> 0:45:05.280
This is a second floor is the first floor.

796
0:45:05.280 --> 0:45:08.240
Again talking about all the pieces work together.

797
0:45:08.240 --> 0:45:11.040
This coffee maker is kind of fun.

798
0:45:11.040 --> 0:45:17.840
Second floor again some lights some chimes and you know some wireless remotes so you

799
0:45:17.840 --> 0:45:21.840
can kind of see they're kind of spread out in different parts of the house.

800
0:45:21.840 --> 0:45:23.560
Here's the pool pump out here.

801
0:45:23.560 --> 0:45:25.040
OK.

802
0:45:25.040 --> 0:45:29.840
This is what the hell you can fake file looks like you basically define your codes and then

803
0:45:29.840 --> 0:45:32.080
the names that go with each of those codes.

804
0:45:32.080 --> 0:45:33.400
All right.

805
0:45:33.400 --> 0:45:36.640
Here's what extent commands look like.

806
0:45:36.640 --> 0:45:38.640
Here's the standard timer.

807
0:45:38.640 --> 0:45:43.800
Here's a crontab course we're running on Linux so we can crontab schedule a whole bunch of

808
0:45:43.800 --> 0:45:45.280
stuff right.

809
0:45:45.280 --> 0:45:50.040
Works just very seamlessly very easy to control for me anyway.

810
0:45:50.040 --> 0:45:52.760
Dawn dust sensor I talked about that.

811
0:45:52.760 --> 0:45:58.560
Here's a remote that you can use to control this is the coffee maker kind of hilarious.

812
0:45:58.560 --> 0:46:05.400
The way we do it is my wife my my aunt lives with us and she usually gets up early.

813
0:46:05.400 --> 0:46:10.680
So my wife has a remote next to the bed and when she wakes up she presses the remote and

814
0:46:10.680 --> 0:46:14.720
then it makes a chime in my aunt's area and that means my aunt should it turns on the

815
0:46:14.720 --> 0:46:16.240
coffee maker for her.

816
0:46:16.240 --> 0:46:17.240
OK.

817
0:46:17.240 --> 0:46:20.140
So I saw somebody look at their spouse.

818
0:46:20.140 --> 0:46:21.140
So yeah.

819
0:46:21.140 --> 0:46:24.880
So the cool thing is that you have to have an ant to set it up for you.

820
0:46:24.880 --> 0:46:29.400
Right or something or want to make a coffee system if you don't have an ant.

821
0:46:29.400 --> 0:46:32.840
But the cool thing is you you you hit the button when you're about to get out of bed

822
0:46:32.840 --> 0:46:35.360
and by the time you get downstairs your coffee's ready.

823
0:46:35.360 --> 0:46:36.360
OK.

824
0:46:36.360 --> 0:46:38.000
And here's the coffee maker time.

825
0:46:38.000 --> 0:46:42.600
It only turns it off for like 15 minutes so it doesn't stay on for long.

826
0:46:42.600 --> 0:46:45.040
And she also has a little button on her phone.

827
0:46:45.040 --> 0:46:51.080
So if she's driving home as she's heading home she can hit the button and then everyone.

828
0:46:51.080 --> 0:46:52.080
Yeah.

829
0:46:52.080 --> 0:46:53.080
Yeah.

830
0:46:53.080 --> 0:46:54.080
OK.

831
0:46:54.080 --> 0:46:58.720
So this is how it actually works on the phone.

832
0:46:58.720 --> 0:47:04.280
I actually have an it actually does an SSH session and then calls an X 10 command and

833
0:47:04.280 --> 0:47:06.080
then logs out basically.

834
0:47:06.080 --> 0:47:07.080
OK.

835
0:47:07.080 --> 0:47:13.120
Pool pump job scheduler weather for the website wireless remote.

836
0:47:13.120 --> 0:47:16.640
This is kind of an interesting case garage entry detection.

837
0:47:16.640 --> 0:47:20.940
I'm not going to get into this but effectively what I ended up doing was to put an X 10 switch

838
0:47:20.940 --> 0:47:28.520
up at the top and when the door comes up it detects it and and just pushes a little lever

839
0:47:28.520 --> 0:47:33.540
and I have an X 10 control with like wires and it sends a signal to say somebody closed

840
0:47:33.540 --> 0:47:36.520
the contact and I know somebody came in the garage.

841
0:47:36.520 --> 0:47:37.520
OK.

842
0:47:37.520 --> 0:47:40.480
And again that's exactly that's what it looks like right there.

843
0:47:40.480 --> 0:47:41.480
Right.

844
0:47:41.480 --> 0:47:42.920
There's the there's a lever right.

845
0:47:42.920 --> 0:47:46.760
And there's the X 10 so the wires go up here and then plugs in and then it goes right to

846
0:47:46.760 --> 0:47:49.000
the computer and the computer does everything.

847
0:47:49.000 --> 0:47:50.000
OK.

848
0:47:50.000 --> 0:47:51.000
All right.

849
0:47:51.000 --> 0:47:52.000
OK.

850
0:47:52.000 --> 0:47:53.000
Let's take some questions.

851
0:47:53.000 --> 0:47:54.000
Yes sir.

852
0:47:54.000 --> 0:47:55.000
Right.

853
0:47:55.000 --> 0:48:16.400
So how would you implement this with modern technology that didn't have as many moving

854
0:48:16.400 --> 0:48:17.400
parts.

855
0:48:17.400 --> 0:48:19.440
So my son I would say has done that.

856
0:48:19.440 --> 0:48:24.320
He's doing Zigbee so everything's controlled with his phone and he's using HomeKit.

857
0:48:24.320 --> 0:48:31.840
So basically he's he's using instead of using switches he's using light bulbs that are Zigbee

858
0:48:31.840 --> 0:48:38.920
enabled and but he's still using some X 10 stuff because he wants a physical switch on

859
0:48:38.920 --> 0:48:40.000
the wall.

860
0:48:40.000 --> 0:48:45.100
So I think the question is are you happy with doing everything on your phone.

861
0:48:45.100 --> 0:48:46.100
That's the question.

862
0:48:46.100 --> 0:48:47.100
Right.

863
0:48:47.100 --> 0:48:51.560
So when I walk into a room do I want to pull my phone out to turn the lights on.

864
0:48:51.560 --> 0:48:52.560
Right.

865
0:48:52.560 --> 0:48:57.080
I think he's OK with that and there's a whole bunch of cool stuff you can do like proximity

866
0:48:57.080 --> 0:49:01.680
when he's getting when his car is getting near the house cool stuff can happen.

867
0:49:01.680 --> 0:49:04.160
So there's a lot of potential there.

868
0:49:04.160 --> 0:49:07.440
But because I'm trying to bridging the old and new technology together that's why it

869
0:49:07.440 --> 0:49:09.000
looks so kind of hokey.

870
0:49:09.000 --> 0:49:10.000
One more question.

871
0:49:10.000 --> 0:49:12.520
Let's see if I can get it right here.

872
0:49:12.520 --> 0:49:13.520
Right.

873
0:49:13.520 --> 0:49:19.040
You're basically clearly to a study where he gone largely for extent which is wired

874
0:49:19.040 --> 0:49:24.720
and you are more of a power user slash tinker.

875
0:49:24.720 --> 0:49:29.840
So but the dealing of the kind of like ever Joe user who's got no idea what exactly smart

876
0:49:29.840 --> 0:49:35.760
home does and or what their smart home assistant sends to the big tech.

877
0:49:35.760 --> 0:49:40.200
How would you talk to such people about automation because we've got the game.

878
0:49:40.200 --> 0:49:43.680
Oh you want your light bulb connected to the Wi-Fi.

879
0:49:43.680 --> 0:49:46.440
Cat flap is connected to the Wi-Fi and everything.

880
0:49:46.440 --> 0:49:49.720
And then they end up with a situation they can switch the lights on at home because the

881
0:49:49.720 --> 0:49:50.720
power is.

882
0:49:50.720 --> 0:49:54.360
How would I start if I didn't know nothing.

883
0:49:54.360 --> 0:49:58.760
I would just say get a get a light bulb that has a phone control and they just kind of

884
0:49:58.760 --> 0:50:00.880
get started with it.

885
0:50:00.880 --> 0:50:05.360
But you're going to be on a 10 year journey potentially because it didn't start this

886
0:50:05.360 --> 0:50:06.360
way.

887
0:50:06.360 --> 0:50:11.200
I started just with the out front lights and it grew over time as I found need.

888
0:50:11.200 --> 0:50:15.260
So again my goal is not really to talk about technology but to figure out how to think

889
0:50:15.260 --> 0:50:19.760
about that technology in relation to you your family and your home.

890
0:50:19.760 --> 0:50:38.280
So thank you.
