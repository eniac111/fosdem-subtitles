1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:09.680
Okay, so we are going to start the next talk.

2
0:00:09.680 --> 0:00:14.800
The next talk is about optimizing your qualifications for integration, learning from integrating

3
0:00:14.800 --> 0:00:18.280
open projects with Nextcloud.

4
0:00:18.280 --> 0:00:19.280
Thank you.

5
0:00:19.280 --> 0:00:20.280
Hello everyone.

6
0:00:20.280 --> 0:00:21.280
My name is Willem Lindeheil.

7
0:00:21.280 --> 0:00:27.040
I am one of the lucky co-founders of OpenProject and today I'm here because I'm also the managing

8
0:00:27.040 --> 0:00:31.000
engineer of the OpenProject Nextcloud integration.

9
0:00:31.000 --> 0:00:36.520
And just to get the first things, the most important message is out right now.

10
0:00:36.520 --> 0:00:40.840
I assume that here are more core developers of open source software, collaboration software

11
0:00:40.840 --> 0:00:43.440
and also product managers here in the room.

12
0:00:43.440 --> 0:00:48.920
So for you, please take home this message, prioritize integrations on your roadmap.

13
0:00:48.920 --> 0:00:49.920
Okay?

14
0:00:49.920 --> 0:00:56.040
So right now is a great moment where the public sector, not only the public sector but many

15
0:00:56.040 --> 0:01:04.520
people ask for integrations that we integrate our open source software together to provide

16
0:01:04.520 --> 0:01:11.560
an alternative to the Office 365, to the Google Cloud, Google applications and so on.

17
0:01:11.560 --> 0:01:18.520
Right now, people ask us that we join together forces so that together that we are stronger

18
0:01:18.520 --> 0:01:23.760
and become stronger in each single application so that we provide an alternative to the big

19
0:01:23.760 --> 0:01:24.760
tax.

20
0:01:24.760 --> 0:01:25.760
Okay?

21
0:01:25.760 --> 0:01:28.480
So integrations are really important.

22
0:01:28.480 --> 0:01:33.520
And with that, every single application, if we integrate, every single application doesn't

23
0:01:33.520 --> 0:01:36.720
need to do what the other application does.

24
0:01:36.720 --> 0:01:43.200
So we can focus on our own stuff and get better in our own silo, on our own puzzle piece of

25
0:01:43.200 --> 0:01:47.320
the big picture.

26
0:01:47.320 --> 0:01:48.840
Now the bad news.

27
0:01:48.840 --> 0:01:53.360
Building integrations is unnecessarily hard.

28
0:01:53.360 --> 0:01:59.040
We always, what the good news is, you always encounter the same problems again and again.

29
0:01:59.040 --> 0:02:04.720
So that kind of predictable what is going to fail when you do an integration.

30
0:02:04.720 --> 0:02:10.280
So my call out here is please drink your own champagne and participate as core developers

31
0:02:10.280 --> 0:02:15.720
in the integration projects that integrate into your system because then you see the

32
0:02:15.720 --> 0:02:19.880
issues that people face when integrating.

33
0:02:19.880 --> 0:02:21.800
Because integrations are amazing, right?

34
0:02:21.800 --> 0:02:26.120
Just imagine what the web would be without a link or a browser would be without extension

35
0:02:26.120 --> 0:02:28.160
or a mobile phone without application.

36
0:02:28.160 --> 0:02:30.160
It would be boring, right?

37
0:02:30.160 --> 0:02:36.200
And it's just unpredictable what integrations come out if you just let people do.

38
0:02:36.200 --> 0:02:37.960
And people have great ideas.

39
0:02:37.960 --> 0:02:43.360
So one example of such a great idea was the public sector.

40
0:02:43.360 --> 0:02:48.200
The city of Cologne and the University of DÃ¼sberg-Eisen approached us with the idea

41
0:02:48.200 --> 0:02:51.420
of hey, you had open project.

42
0:02:51.420 --> 0:02:57.160
We like you really much for organizing work, organizing tasks, organizing our teams.

43
0:02:57.160 --> 0:03:03.360
And we also use Nextcloud for organizing our files to share the files with our people.

44
0:03:03.360 --> 0:03:06.080
And we always find the same problem again and again.

45
0:03:06.080 --> 0:03:08.500
Where are the files for our tasks?

46
0:03:08.500 --> 0:03:10.640
So when you do some work, you do a real job.

47
0:03:10.640 --> 0:03:16.880
You usually need some files as input to work on the task and then at the end you need to

48
0:03:16.880 --> 0:03:19.840
deliver some files and put them somewhere.

49
0:03:19.840 --> 0:03:22.920
And you need to communicate somewhere where the files are.

50
0:03:22.920 --> 0:03:27.200
So why not tracking that at the same entity, which is the ticket.

51
0:03:27.200 --> 0:03:33.400
We call it a work package and solve that problem and have some real integrity between the two

52
0:03:33.400 --> 0:03:40.160
systems like work package and real ID linking to the files in Nextcloud.

53
0:03:40.160 --> 0:03:43.840
So for the last year, roughly eight people were working on this deep integration.

54
0:03:43.840 --> 0:03:46.840
There's a lot of people because it's pretty hard.

55
0:03:46.840 --> 0:03:54.440
But anyway, so what we got is what you can see here is like an open project with a work

56
0:03:54.440 --> 0:03:59.240
package and you can see there's some tasks, like second fermentation dough.

57
0:03:59.240 --> 0:04:00.240
You want to do this.

58
0:04:00.240 --> 0:04:02.040
You want to have a nice pizza.

59
0:04:02.040 --> 0:04:08.320
And on the right hand side, you have the files tab where you see all the files that are related.

60
0:04:08.320 --> 0:04:12.280
And now it's not only that you have attachments, which were there already, not open project

61
0:04:12.280 --> 0:04:13.280
before.

62
0:04:13.280 --> 0:04:19.720
You can also add multiple Nextcloud instances to your open project and say, okay, these

63
0:04:19.720 --> 0:04:23.080
files should be stored here with that contributor.

64
0:04:23.080 --> 0:04:28.840
These files should be stored there with this client, with this subcontractor.

65
0:04:28.840 --> 0:04:33.720
So you can have multiple next cloud instances connected to open project.

66
0:04:33.720 --> 0:04:42.320
And you will always see which files are relevant for finishing a task and where you should

67
0:04:42.320 --> 0:04:44.080
put the files when you're ready and done.

68
0:04:44.080 --> 0:04:49.640
And you hand over the task to the next one, the next assignee, let's say, and you follow

69
0:04:49.640 --> 0:04:53.600
workflow process with an open project.

70
0:04:53.600 --> 0:04:58.960
And on the other side, or Nextcloud, when you're on a file or you're on a folder, you

71
0:04:58.960 --> 0:05:04.600
can see where these files or folders are relevant and which task, which business processes they

72
0:05:04.600 --> 0:05:05.600
come up.

73
0:05:05.600 --> 0:05:09.360
So you can see here on the right hand side, we have this open project tab.

74
0:05:09.360 --> 0:05:16.440
So you can see, okay, this file is relevant in two places and two work packages.

75
0:05:16.440 --> 0:05:19.760
You can quickly see what status they are in.

76
0:05:19.760 --> 0:05:27.400
So the problem of where the files for my task are finally solved.

77
0:05:27.400 --> 0:05:32.600
Now I want to get a little bit deeper into the architecture of that thing because we

78
0:05:32.600 --> 0:05:37.260
want to talk about problems that come with integrations.

79
0:05:37.260 --> 0:05:40.360
So it's a very, very high level architecture picture.

80
0:05:40.360 --> 0:05:44.240
As you can see, there's an open project server, there's an Nextcloud server, there's an open

81
0:05:44.240 --> 0:05:49.080
project front end that runs in the same browser that runs the Nextcloud front end, same different

82
0:05:49.080 --> 0:05:50.960
browser windows.

83
0:05:50.960 --> 0:05:54.400
And for this integration, we extended the open project core.

84
0:05:54.400 --> 0:05:55.960
So it's not a plugin.

85
0:05:55.960 --> 0:06:00.240
It's right in the open project core, which extends the open project front end.

86
0:06:00.240 --> 0:06:06.840
And on the Nextcloud side, we put everything into a Nextcloud app, which is basically a

87
0:06:06.840 --> 0:06:09.680
bundle of code that you execute within Nextcloud.

88
0:06:09.680 --> 0:06:14.160
Or we could call it a plugin or extension.

89
0:06:14.160 --> 0:06:20.100
So that plugin extends the Nextcloud server and also the Nextcloud front end.

90
0:06:20.100 --> 0:06:25.560
What we chose for the communication between the two systems is that we want that every

91
0:06:25.560 --> 0:06:29.820
user, because users have permissions on the one system and users have permissions on the

92
0:06:29.820 --> 0:06:33.440
other system, we wanted to make sure that these things match up.

93
0:06:33.440 --> 0:06:38.800
So that an open project user that is looking for a file can only see files of, can only

94
0:06:38.800 --> 0:06:45.320
select files to link them that he or she has access to.

95
0:06:45.320 --> 0:06:49.920
But at the same time, we wanted to make sure that all linked files are visible to all users

96
0:06:49.920 --> 0:06:53.640
because someone says, like, this is the relevant file, maybe you don't have access, but you

97
0:06:53.640 --> 0:06:55.100
should know that these files exist.

98
0:06:55.100 --> 0:07:02.060
So we have these references by file ID from open project to Nextcloud.

99
0:07:02.060 --> 0:07:05.980
And the other way around, of course, as well, when you're in Nextcloud and you saw these

100
0:07:05.980 --> 0:07:11.360
files linked, the work packages linked, you also should only link those work packages

101
0:07:11.360 --> 0:07:12.800
that you have access to.

102
0:07:12.800 --> 0:07:17.060
So work packages are organized in projects, you're a member of a project or not.

103
0:07:17.060 --> 0:07:18.960
So depending on this, you have access or not.

104
0:07:18.960 --> 0:07:21.640
So we need to have some one-on-one matching between the users.

105
0:07:21.640 --> 0:07:25.800
So we use OAuth for this one-on-one matching.

106
0:07:25.800 --> 0:07:30.400
So users are always authenticated and don't need to re-authenticate every time they log

107
0:07:30.400 --> 0:07:31.400
in.

108
0:07:31.400 --> 0:07:32.400
Okay.

109
0:07:32.400 --> 0:07:40.680
So, but there's one thing on this architecture you can already spot maybe that smells like

110
0:07:40.680 --> 0:07:42.080
trouble.

111
0:07:42.080 --> 0:07:46.400
That is the arrow in the middle that goes from the open project front and directly to

112
0:07:46.400 --> 0:07:47.680
Nextcloud.

113
0:07:47.680 --> 0:07:52.800
Because that is a request, a cross-site request in the browser between two domains.

114
0:07:52.800 --> 0:07:54.280
And here's where trouble starts.

115
0:07:54.280 --> 0:07:57.960
We'll come to this later.

116
0:07:57.960 --> 0:08:02.520
So clippinger.

117
0:08:02.520 --> 0:08:06.520
So yeah, from this work, I just want to come up with a couple of things that are lessons

118
0:08:06.520 --> 0:08:11.360
learned and I would just like point them out for you to think and digest a little bit what

119
0:08:11.360 --> 0:08:14.240
it means to your project.

120
0:08:14.240 --> 0:08:19.960
So of course, okay, if you want to have integrations, of course, provide an API, that's obvious.

121
0:08:19.960 --> 0:08:22.280
Nextcloud and open project does that pretty well, I think.

122
0:08:22.280 --> 0:08:25.400
We have docs and examples.

123
0:08:25.400 --> 0:08:28.960
But then the tiny things start, you know, like, okay, you have an API, you think it's

124
0:08:28.960 --> 0:08:30.460
cool and safe.

125
0:08:30.460 --> 0:08:38.440
But in the example of this direct access that I set on the architecture image, this is about

126
0:08:38.440 --> 0:08:41.320
direct file upload and downloads.

127
0:08:41.320 --> 0:08:45.640
So this is something that is kind of obvious that you don't want to send the data through

128
0:08:45.640 --> 0:08:50.740
the open project server, like let's say if you want to get a movie and then to Nextcloud,

129
0:08:50.740 --> 0:08:57.680
you want to upload this directly or download this directly to the open project front end.

130
0:08:57.680 --> 0:09:08.320
So it turns out the API that Nextcloud provides for this thing is working-ish, but not, you

131
0:09:08.320 --> 0:09:14.000
know, in a way that it did not work, okay?

132
0:09:14.000 --> 0:09:20.680
But it was really unfortunate because they had everything in place, but I bet they never

133
0:09:20.680 --> 0:09:26.840
had this scenario in their own company to use that in a cross-site domain environment.

134
0:09:26.840 --> 0:09:35.320
And so they didn't come across like two, twice, course problems, you know, your course security

135
0:09:35.320 --> 0:09:41.480
in the browser that prevents you to do stuff that you shouldn't do in the browser, like,

136
0:09:41.480 --> 0:09:43.920
browser security features.

137
0:09:43.920 --> 0:09:48.560
And if you just have non-browser clients, these things don't show up.

138
0:09:48.560 --> 0:09:52.080
If you just have a Nextcloud client on your desk, these things don't show up.

139
0:09:52.080 --> 0:09:54.000
They are not browser context.

140
0:09:54.000 --> 0:09:58.040
So my lessons learned is here also for us, open project.

141
0:09:58.040 --> 0:10:02.000
We are not saving these fields neither.

142
0:10:02.000 --> 0:10:06.120
Make sure that if you provide an API, also test it in a browser setting, right?

143
0:10:06.120 --> 0:10:08.080
And not just write it and hope it works.

144
0:10:08.080 --> 0:10:10.040
You have these course preflights.

145
0:10:10.040 --> 0:10:14.280
You need to check if the course preflight itself doesn't fail, right?

146
0:10:14.280 --> 0:10:16.240
There can be issues.

147
0:10:16.240 --> 0:10:17.640
Okay.

148
0:10:17.640 --> 0:10:21.000
Another one, a tiny one, but I need to say this.

149
0:10:21.000 --> 0:10:23.720
You know, we as open project, we want to link files.

150
0:10:23.720 --> 0:10:28.440
And these files we don't reference by path because the path is different for every user

151
0:10:28.440 --> 0:10:30.240
or can be different for every user.

152
0:10:30.240 --> 0:10:34.080
Because if you get a file shared with you and you save it in your Nextcloud with a different

153
0:10:34.080 --> 0:10:36.640
file name, the path is completely different.

154
0:10:36.640 --> 0:10:38.000
And it doesn't work for the other user.

155
0:10:38.000 --> 0:10:41.760
They say another user, there's an open project project.

156
0:10:41.760 --> 0:10:44.280
So we need to reference the file.

157
0:10:44.280 --> 0:10:47.960
But there's no API for getting files.

158
0:10:47.960 --> 0:10:48.960
Thanks.

159
0:10:48.960 --> 0:10:51.720
For getting files by ID.

160
0:10:51.720 --> 0:10:57.600
Especially if you want to know what is the original file name that the owner of the file

161
0:10:57.600 --> 0:11:04.400
gave to the file, or if you want to know if the file was already deleted, if it was trashed,

162
0:11:04.400 --> 0:11:07.080
it was in the trash bin.

163
0:11:07.080 --> 0:11:11.480
Information like this, we want to ask them frequently in order to update our knowledge

164
0:11:11.480 --> 0:11:13.760
about the file on open project.

165
0:11:13.760 --> 0:11:14.760
It wasn't there.

166
0:11:14.760 --> 0:11:16.880
Probably never needed on the Nextcloud side.

167
0:11:16.880 --> 0:11:17.880
So that's cool.

168
0:11:17.880 --> 0:11:18.880
They don't need it.

169
0:11:18.880 --> 0:11:23.360
But, yeah, kind of obvious, there's the main objects of Nextcloud.

170
0:11:23.360 --> 0:11:24.360
And we need them.

171
0:11:24.360 --> 0:11:26.400
We need the information.

172
0:11:26.400 --> 0:11:31.360
And yeah, this problem became visible here.

173
0:11:31.360 --> 0:11:38.920
If you want to build, allow, if you want to allow integrations into your system while

174
0:11:38.920 --> 0:11:41.580
creating a plugin interface is a great idea.

175
0:11:41.580 --> 0:11:43.680
Open project has a plugin interface.

176
0:11:43.680 --> 0:11:46.960
You can extend open project code as you like.

177
0:11:46.960 --> 0:11:50.560
You need to be the server admin in order to make it run.

178
0:11:50.560 --> 0:11:52.600
Nextcloud is much ahead in that sense.

179
0:11:52.600 --> 0:11:53.600
They have the app store.

180
0:11:53.600 --> 0:11:59.480
You just can click from a catalog and as a, not as a server administrator, but as an application

181
0:11:59.480 --> 0:12:03.360
administrator who doesn't like to talk to server administrators.

182
0:12:03.360 --> 0:12:09.520
You can simply download, download, install extensions to Nextcloud.

183
0:12:09.520 --> 0:12:11.360
It's in the core of Nextcloud.

184
0:12:11.360 --> 0:12:12.960
That's really, really cool.

185
0:12:12.960 --> 0:12:16.320
It's amazing and I'm jealous I would love to have this open project.

186
0:12:16.320 --> 0:12:17.320
Yeah.

187
0:12:17.320 --> 0:12:18.960
So PHP, you know.

188
0:12:18.960 --> 0:12:19.960
Is it?

189
0:12:19.960 --> 0:12:20.960
Yeah.

190
0:12:20.960 --> 0:12:23.960
Okay, tomorrow it's done.

191
0:12:23.960 --> 0:12:26.640
No, okay.

192
0:12:26.640 --> 0:12:32.160
Okay, thank you.

193
0:12:32.160 --> 0:12:44.880
Okay, so once you have, you have this plugin interface built in your application, then

194
0:12:44.880 --> 0:12:51.360
that the typical things that every, every person that is, that is implementing this

195
0:12:51.360 --> 0:12:53.560
interface comes across.

196
0:12:53.560 --> 0:13:01.080
For example, if you want to have cross site fetching, cross site calls, you need to allow

197
0:13:01.080 --> 0:13:06.800
in that application, extend the content security policy for cross site requests.

198
0:13:06.800 --> 0:13:11.440
And there's something, for example, that we discovered that open project did not allow

199
0:13:11.440 --> 0:13:14.360
or make easy in the first place.

200
0:13:14.360 --> 0:13:15.520
So we had to extend that.

201
0:13:15.520 --> 0:13:17.120
It's a typical one.

202
0:13:17.120 --> 0:13:20.560
It only, you know, in the theory, everything is working and then you run it in your browser

203
0:13:20.560 --> 0:13:26.640
and in the very last moment of implementing all the features, you see, oh, it's not working

204
0:13:26.640 --> 0:13:28.320
because of content security policy.

205
0:13:28.320 --> 0:13:32.000
Okay, that's a nice one.

206
0:13:32.000 --> 0:13:36.480
So when you're like a application administrator, an open project, and you're also an application

207
0:13:36.480 --> 0:13:40.760
administrator in Nextcloud and you want to set up the connection, the integration, the

208
0:13:40.760 --> 0:13:45.120
first thing that you do is you put in the URL of the other system, right?

209
0:13:45.120 --> 0:13:50.800
And you want to know if you put, or you should get some feedback if the, actually, if the

210
0:13:50.800 --> 0:13:51.800
URL is valid.

211
0:13:51.800 --> 0:13:56.280
Let's say you're Nextcloud, you want to know that open project is actually responding.

212
0:13:56.280 --> 0:14:00.360
Open project is responding in the necessary version.

213
0:14:00.360 --> 0:14:01.360
We don't have that.

214
0:14:01.360 --> 0:14:04.320
We don't expose that information.

215
0:14:04.320 --> 0:14:09.240
You want to know if the setup is complete.

216
0:14:09.240 --> 0:14:10.360
There's more about the other way.

217
0:14:10.360 --> 0:14:14.960
Like, let's say from open project you want to connect to Nextcloud.

218
0:14:14.960 --> 0:14:19.360
Of course, we also want to know if our extension is installed.

219
0:14:19.360 --> 0:14:25.400
So it would be great if you have an API endpoint that gives you information saying, nah, it's

220
0:14:25.400 --> 0:14:28.880
not installed, so the validation of the URL is failing.

221
0:14:28.880 --> 0:14:34.240
That's something that is very, very useful for the administrators to get relevant feedback

222
0:14:34.240 --> 0:14:36.640
for why things are not working.

223
0:14:36.640 --> 0:14:39.800
Because if you just put in a URL, you don't have any idea why it's not working.

224
0:14:39.800 --> 0:14:41.040
You need to get feedback.

225
0:14:41.040 --> 0:14:46.360
And this is something I think every core developer should think of as providing a super nice

226
0:14:46.360 --> 0:14:50.200
candy for developers.

227
0:14:50.200 --> 0:14:54.640
Another one that is, that's a topic.

228
0:14:54.640 --> 0:14:58.240
So we're working a lot with OAuth.

229
0:14:58.240 --> 0:15:03.080
Setting up OAuth, I don't know if you know what, it has basically a lot of fears, like

230
0:15:03.080 --> 0:15:09.280
a secret, an ID, it has the redirect URL, and so on and so on.

231
0:15:09.280 --> 0:15:12.880
If you are a hoster or a tester, you would like to script that stuff.

232
0:15:12.880 --> 0:15:17.200
So you would like to have an API to set this stuff up.

233
0:15:17.200 --> 0:15:21.200
And it's great if you provide an API for setting up OAuth.

234
0:15:21.200 --> 0:15:26.760
Also, if you have an API, you can do stuff like having one button in some setting and

235
0:15:26.760 --> 0:15:30.480
say disconnect integration all over the place.

236
0:15:30.480 --> 0:15:31.480
Delete it.

237
0:15:31.480 --> 0:15:32.480
I want to start again.

238
0:15:32.480 --> 0:15:33.480
I screwed up.

239
0:15:33.480 --> 0:15:34.480
I don't know what.

240
0:15:34.480 --> 0:15:41.720
I screwed up.

241
0:15:41.720 --> 0:15:47.920
So for this you need a API so that you can do this.

242
0:15:47.920 --> 0:15:53.360
And if you actually delete an OAuth connection, then please also make sure that the tokens

243
0:15:53.360 --> 0:15:54.360
are deleted.

244
0:15:54.360 --> 0:15:55.360
Right?

245
0:15:55.360 --> 0:16:00.680
So that was something that we discovered with Nextcloud, that the tokens were still around

246
0:16:00.680 --> 0:16:02.680
for quite some time.

247
0:16:02.680 --> 0:16:06.960
And the good thing is it came up and we could provide tickets and these things could get

248
0:16:06.960 --> 0:16:11.480
solved.

249
0:16:11.480 --> 0:16:14.800
That's also another one, nice one.

250
0:16:14.800 --> 0:16:21.080
Just imagine you do the OAuth connection, so there's one user in Nextcloud and connects

251
0:16:21.080 --> 0:16:26.680
as the user in an open project and that user happens to be admin in an open project.

252
0:16:26.680 --> 0:16:31.220
Suddenly the access as an admin comes to Nextcloud.

253
0:16:31.220 --> 0:16:32.220
So there's a lot of powers.

254
0:16:32.220 --> 0:16:33.220
You can create projects.

255
0:16:33.220 --> 0:16:35.240
You can delete users.

256
0:16:35.240 --> 0:16:39.440
And maybe for the integration that is not needed and vice versa.

257
0:16:39.440 --> 0:16:43.740
Open project might not need complete administrator rights on Nextcloud.

258
0:16:43.740 --> 0:16:54.800
So there's like opening the surface for attacks or the opening for problems to vulnerabilities

259
0:16:54.800 --> 0:16:55.800
by a lot.

260
0:16:55.800 --> 0:17:04.800
And I think open project at Nextcloud we could do better in having scoped OAuth access control

261
0:17:04.800 --> 0:17:09.520
so that you don't allow creating or deleting projects or that you don't allow deleting

262
0:17:09.520 --> 0:17:11.200
users and so on.

263
0:17:11.200 --> 0:17:16.720
So limiting just for the user scope actions.

264
0:17:16.720 --> 0:17:18.360
We can do better.

265
0:17:18.360 --> 0:17:20.000
We can.

266
0:17:20.000 --> 0:17:25.400
Also what is nice, what I really enjoyed about working with Nextcloud is that they provide

267
0:17:25.400 --> 0:17:26.400
a design system.

268
0:17:26.400 --> 0:17:32.600
They have frontend components and that allowed us to have more consistent UI that look and

269
0:17:32.600 --> 0:17:38.480
feel like the Nextcloud and also increase the development speed for us.

270
0:17:38.480 --> 0:17:41.600
At open project we also are working in design system and co-UI components.

271
0:17:41.600 --> 0:17:44.160
So if you want to have a talk, listen to a talk about this.

272
0:17:44.160 --> 0:17:45.760
Parima, where are you?

273
0:17:45.760 --> 0:17:46.760
Tomorrow?

274
0:17:46.760 --> 0:17:47.760
Same time?

275
0:17:47.760 --> 0:17:48.760
Yeah.

276
0:17:48.760 --> 0:17:49.760
Okay.

277
0:17:49.760 --> 0:17:51.760
Have fun.

278
0:17:51.760 --> 0:17:52.760
Yeah.

279
0:17:52.760 --> 0:18:03.480
Then also what is really handy for developers that develop integrations for your system is

280
0:18:03.480 --> 0:18:12.080
if you have containerized development environments already at hand, so it's easier to check out

281
0:18:12.080 --> 0:18:16.960
your code with the latest supported versions.

282
0:18:16.960 --> 0:18:19.200
For example, Nextcloud has multiple versions.

283
0:18:19.200 --> 0:18:22.240
Need to support, you need to check, you want to find out if it's still working.

284
0:18:22.240 --> 0:18:26.720
And of course the current main branch to see what is actually changing in the main branch

285
0:18:26.720 --> 0:18:31.900
is my code still alive or it's already dying.

286
0:18:31.900 --> 0:18:36.480
So it's really nice to have, for example, Docker compose files that help you setting

287
0:18:36.480 --> 0:18:43.760
up and lower the barrier to get started in developing an integration for your application.

288
0:18:43.760 --> 0:18:45.760
Yeah.

289
0:18:45.760 --> 0:18:53.400
Also as a bonus on this, if you can provide examples how to set up your CI quickly so

290
0:18:53.400 --> 0:18:55.880
that you don't need to fiddle around with that.

291
0:18:55.880 --> 0:19:01.400
If you just have good standard practices, how to have CI running with that and that

292
0:19:01.400 --> 0:19:08.520
core image and with a plugin, it would be also very, very handy for developers to have.

293
0:19:08.520 --> 0:19:17.920
I think we could sneak into other integrations and we could see how they did it in Nextcloud.

294
0:19:17.920 --> 0:19:20.200
So it wasn't such a big trouble.

295
0:19:20.200 --> 0:19:24.680
But if you have a good example that is really, really helpful.

296
0:19:24.680 --> 0:19:31.560
Yeah, so with all these small like spots of lessons learned that we have had in the last

297
0:19:31.560 --> 0:19:39.960
year, I just want to send you home, let it sink in and just remember integrated we're

298
0:19:39.960 --> 0:19:40.960
stronger.

299
0:19:40.960 --> 0:19:41.960
Thank you.

300
0:19:41.960 --> 0:19:55.160
We have six minutes for questions.

301
0:19:55.160 --> 0:20:22.160
So the question is why we need to deal with multiple Nextcloud versions.

302
0:20:22.160 --> 0:20:30.200
I think Nextcloud has multiple versions in production like supported.

303
0:20:30.200 --> 0:20:34.960
So it's like I think 23, 24, 25, maybe 22 still.

304
0:20:34.960 --> 0:20:37.080
I'm not sure.

305
0:20:37.080 --> 0:20:39.840
And they have different code.

306
0:20:39.840 --> 0:20:42.300
But we just provide one currently.

307
0:20:42.300 --> 0:20:48.280
We just provide one piece of code that is the Nextcloud app, our Nextcloud app.

308
0:20:48.280 --> 0:20:50.800
And we don't want to provide three different ones.

309
0:20:50.800 --> 0:20:56.760
So we want to make sure that in that app all versions are supported.

310
0:20:56.760 --> 0:20:57.760
It's different for Open Project.

311
0:20:57.760 --> 0:21:01.280
Open Project always has just one running, one up to date version.

312
0:21:01.280 --> 0:21:07.600
So you'd always need to update to the latest version unless you want to get into trouble.

313
0:21:07.600 --> 0:21:13.840
So this is why you need multiple versions.

314
0:21:13.840 --> 0:21:15.840
More questions?

315
0:21:15.840 --> 0:21:17.800
Okay.

316
0:21:17.800 --> 0:21:18.800
Thank you.

317
0:21:18.800 --> 0:21:20.800
Ben?

318
0:21:20.800 --> 0:21:22.800
Yeah.

319
0:21:22.800 --> 0:21:25.800
I want to add another question.

320
0:21:25.800 --> 0:21:27.800
I want to add onto this.

321
0:21:27.800 --> 0:21:29.800
I think declarative configuration is always better than scripting.

322
0:21:29.800 --> 0:21:35.800
So if you can, if it's possible in the application for example to provide OAuth configuration

323
0:21:35.800 --> 0:21:39.800
statically instead of via the spreads, I think that's always better.

324
0:21:39.800 --> 0:21:45.800
Because it allows you to basically state this deploys of your applications including the

325
0:21:45.800 --> 0:21:47.800
whole OAuth context.

326
0:21:47.800 --> 0:21:48.800
Yeah.

327
0:21:48.800 --> 0:21:50.800
It's just a comment I wanted to...

328
0:21:50.800 --> 0:21:51.800
Yeah.

329
0:21:51.800 --> 0:21:57.080
So the comment was just if you can provide it as a, let's say YAML file or something

330
0:21:57.080 --> 0:22:01.000
like this, a declaration, it's better than to have an API.

331
0:22:01.000 --> 0:22:06.320
I'm not so sure about OAuth in that moment because then you would need to have a center

332
0:22:06.320 --> 0:22:08.280
when you set up both systems at the same time.

333
0:22:08.280 --> 0:22:14.040
You wouldn't need to have a center that decides on the OAuth client ID and client secret and

334
0:22:14.040 --> 0:22:18.040
make it configurable from a center.

335
0:22:18.040 --> 0:22:19.040
Yeah.

336
0:22:19.040 --> 0:22:25.800
If these IDs and secrets there get actually generated by the applications itself because

337
0:22:25.800 --> 0:22:29.240
they get updated and maybe your center is not getting updated, maybe you create just

338
0:22:29.240 --> 0:22:31.040
a vulnerability here.

339
0:22:31.040 --> 0:22:36.840
So we were discussing this forth and back, but we believe that next had an O project

340
0:22:36.840 --> 0:22:42.340
that continuously update and maybe some central distribution software might not get touched

341
0:22:42.340 --> 0:22:47.480
in three years and then it's outdated and the algorithms are not secure anymore or whatever.

342
0:22:47.480 --> 0:22:48.480
Yeah.

343
0:22:48.480 --> 0:22:56.480
So Trent, yeah, I'm not sure maybe you talked about it or I probably was not listening.

344
0:22:56.480 --> 0:23:01.080
I think you mentioned files as an example for the actual what is integrated between

345
0:23:01.080 --> 0:23:02.080
both systems.

346
0:23:02.080 --> 0:23:05.600
Was the scope broader than that or was it primarily that?

347
0:23:05.600 --> 0:23:09.920
And was it any discussion because they put multiple things that could be integrated in

348
0:23:09.920 --> 0:23:11.920
a sense, right?

349
0:23:11.920 --> 0:23:12.920
Yeah.

350
0:23:12.920 --> 0:23:17.480
I mean, this integration basically focuses on files and folders, right?

351
0:23:17.480 --> 0:23:23.040
Because you want to, it's about integrating digital assets into work packages, right?

352
0:23:23.040 --> 0:23:24.960
So you have this links.

353
0:23:24.960 --> 0:23:27.000
So that's the example I chose.

354
0:23:27.000 --> 0:23:33.440
Actually, it would be interesting to have some standards also for API standards.

355
0:23:33.440 --> 0:23:34.440
Why not?

356
0:23:34.440 --> 0:23:36.960
Let's say every system has users.

357
0:23:36.960 --> 0:23:40.240
Why does a user need to be represented different in every system?

358
0:23:40.240 --> 0:23:44.520
Why can't we have standard on that or the avatar or, you know, it's like there's stuff

359
0:23:44.520 --> 0:23:45.520
of permissions.

360
0:23:45.520 --> 0:23:48.960
Why can't we have permission standard somehow for all open source vendors?

361
0:23:48.960 --> 0:23:49.960
I don't know.

362
0:23:49.960 --> 0:23:52.560
Let's think about it.

363
0:23:52.560 --> 0:23:56.840
But I don't see a reason why it needs to be so different.

364
0:23:56.840 --> 0:24:00.440
Permissions have been around for so long.

365
0:24:00.440 --> 0:24:02.440
Yeah.

366
0:24:02.440 --> 0:24:05.440
More questions?

367
0:24:05.440 --> 0:24:12.440
Yes, that's my pizza.

368
0:24:12.440 --> 0:24:13.440
Pizza Napolitana.

369
0:24:13.440 --> 0:24:14.440
VLAN style.

370
0:24:14.440 --> 0:24:15.440
Okay.

371
0:24:15.440 --> 0:24:16.440
Thank you very much.

372
0:24:16.440 --> 0:24:37.120
Thank you.
