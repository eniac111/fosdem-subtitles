1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:11.060
Great. Again, I hope everyone's had a great first day at

2
0:00:11.060 --> 0:00:14.480
Fostem in person again and thank

3
0:00:14.480 --> 0:00:16.740
you for staying to the last presentation.

4
0:00:16.740 --> 0:00:20.460
My name is Lauren and I'm a software engineer at

5
0:00:20.460 --> 0:00:24.420
Condor Labs and I work on the open source project Zulip.

6
0:00:24.420 --> 0:00:29.700
I'm going to be talking about how you can collaborate

7
0:00:29.700 --> 0:00:32.840
via chat, hopefully transparently,

8
0:00:32.840 --> 0:00:36.080
efficiently and asynchronously.

9
0:00:38.240 --> 0:00:42.280
So as a collaboration tool,

10
0:00:42.280 --> 0:00:46.320
and we're thinking especially here as open source communities,

11
0:00:46.320 --> 0:00:49.640
open source software projects, open research projects,

12
0:00:49.640 --> 0:00:52.320
what are some of the benefits of chat that we have?

13
0:00:52.320 --> 0:00:55.800
Really, I mean, we have so many collaboration tools

14
0:00:55.800 --> 0:00:57.100
and communication tools.

15
0:00:57.100 --> 0:01:02.240
We have e-mail, we have our issue trackers.

16
0:01:02.240 --> 0:01:04.680
But chat can really be a place of

17
0:01:04.680 --> 0:01:07.160
generating some community and connection.

18
0:01:07.160 --> 0:01:10.480
Also, it's a low friction,

19
0:01:10.480 --> 0:01:13.600
lightweight place to connect and create some of those things.

20
0:01:13.600 --> 0:01:18.040
So it can be a really beneficial place for our projects,

21
0:01:18.040 --> 0:01:23.240
but it comes with some challenges.

22
0:01:23.240 --> 0:01:28.160
So who here works with

23
0:01:28.160 --> 0:01:30.720
some folks that are maybe in a different time zone than them?

24
0:01:30.720 --> 0:01:33.440
Yeah, me, I definitely do.

25
0:01:33.440 --> 0:01:36.120
So that can be really challenging if you have

26
0:01:36.120 --> 0:01:39.880
a chat application going because we think of chat as being live.

27
0:01:39.880 --> 0:01:41.720
We're all sitting down at our computers together,

28
0:01:41.720 --> 0:01:45.960
but if you're working with someone in a totally different time zone,

29
0:01:45.960 --> 0:01:48.180
then your chat is not going to be synchronous.

30
0:01:48.180 --> 0:01:52.800
It's going to need to be functional in a different sense.

31
0:01:52.800 --> 0:01:56.880
So that's a challenge of chat in our communities.

32
0:01:56.880 --> 0:01:59.280
Also, in our communities, we have so many things going on.

33
0:01:59.280 --> 0:02:01.840
We have new features that we want to implement.

34
0:02:01.840 --> 0:02:05.440
We have bugs that we're fixing issues that we're dealing with.

35
0:02:05.440 --> 0:02:07.640
We have releases to manage,

36
0:02:07.640 --> 0:02:09.400
conferences to attend.

37
0:02:09.400 --> 0:02:11.640
So we've got a lot going on and that can

38
0:02:11.640 --> 0:02:15.680
really make chat become very overwhelming very quickly.

39
0:02:15.680 --> 0:02:18.800
We have a lot of different folks in our communities,

40
0:02:18.800 --> 0:02:21.200
and they all have different needs and play different roles.

41
0:02:21.200 --> 0:02:25.320
So we're going to go through an analysis,

42
0:02:25.320 --> 0:02:28.120
and I encourage you to think about your open source community,

43
0:02:28.120 --> 0:02:30.120
your open research community maybe,

44
0:02:30.120 --> 0:02:33.000
and these roles and what their needs might be,

45
0:02:33.000 --> 0:02:36.040
in addition to the ones that I've specified here.

46
0:02:36.040 --> 0:02:41.120
So project leaders, the folks who are leading the charge of your project,

47
0:02:41.120 --> 0:02:43.960
the people who are making it happen.

48
0:02:43.960 --> 0:02:47.280
What are some of their needs and challenges with chat?

49
0:02:47.280 --> 0:02:50.200
Well, they want to be there and have

50
0:02:50.200 --> 0:02:52.880
those connections with the community in chat,

51
0:02:52.880 --> 0:02:56.960
but they also really want to make sure that they're not missing anything in chat,

52
0:02:56.960 --> 0:02:58.240
if they're not there.

53
0:02:58.240 --> 0:03:03.680
So there's this balance between connecting and also being able to step away from it,

54
0:03:03.680 --> 0:03:06.520
that we have as project leaders.

55
0:03:06.520 --> 0:03:08.560
We have our core contributors.

56
0:03:08.560 --> 0:03:11.480
I'm a core contributor to Zulip.

57
0:03:11.480 --> 0:03:13.600
When your core folks come on,

58
0:03:13.600 --> 0:03:14.880
they're working more often,

59
0:03:14.880 --> 0:03:16.880
they're checking on a chat more often,

60
0:03:16.880 --> 0:03:22.560
but they really want when they check in with chat for it to be relevant to the work they're doing,

61
0:03:22.560 --> 0:03:28.120
and helpful that they're participating in chat.

62
0:03:28.120 --> 0:03:32.040
Then they also want to be able to go away and focus on their work,

63
0:03:32.040 --> 0:03:33.320
and then come back to chat.

64
0:03:33.320 --> 0:03:37.840
So it's again this coming and going that becomes a challenge.

65
0:03:38.960 --> 0:03:42.960
Our casual contributors, folks who are maybe invested in our project,

66
0:03:42.960 --> 0:03:44.600
but are not there day-to-day.

67
0:03:44.600 --> 0:03:52.680
Folks who are checking in maybe on the weekends or once in a while.

68
0:03:52.680 --> 0:03:54.840
So what about these folks?

69
0:03:54.840 --> 0:04:01.200
Well, honestly, if the chat is just a big volume of messages that are coming in,

70
0:04:01.200 --> 0:04:02.720
and this huge stream,

71
0:04:02.720 --> 0:04:05.040
they may not even use chat as a collaboration tool,

72
0:04:05.040 --> 0:04:07.560
because when they come in and see that there are

73
0:04:07.560 --> 0:04:11.440
hundreds and hundreds of unread messages that they have to sort through and see through,

74
0:04:11.440 --> 0:04:14.920
they're going to say, hey, I'm going to go somewhere else to collaborate.

75
0:04:14.920 --> 0:04:16.360
I'm going to look at the issue tracker,

76
0:04:16.360 --> 0:04:20.080
I'm going to be on the email list or whatnot.

77
0:04:21.000 --> 0:04:24.600
They're not going to really know what's going on in the way that chat is.

78
0:04:24.600 --> 0:04:26.880
So that can be really a challenge.

79
0:04:27.680 --> 0:04:30.000
If we want our communities to grow,

80
0:04:30.000 --> 0:04:31.520
we need new folks coming in,

81
0:04:31.520 --> 0:04:37.600
new contributors, new people getting invested in our projects.

82
0:04:37.600 --> 0:04:43.760
When they come in, we don't want those people lurking, hiding.

83
0:04:43.760 --> 0:04:45.760
I don't know what to do, what's going on.

84
0:04:45.760 --> 0:04:48.800
We want those people to be able to feel like they have a space to step

85
0:04:48.800 --> 0:04:51.520
forward and start participating, have a voice,

86
0:04:51.520 --> 0:04:57.720
and not be this shadowy person in the background until they figure things out.

87
0:04:58.440 --> 0:05:01.640
We want them to get a sense of who our community is,

88
0:05:01.640 --> 0:05:05.760
what they're doing, what we're doing together, what we're building.

89
0:05:05.760 --> 0:05:09.480
We have end users,

90
0:05:09.480 --> 0:05:11.840
the people who are using our projects.

91
0:05:11.840 --> 0:05:14.400
So when they come into a chat,

92
0:05:14.400 --> 0:05:16.040
again, it is overwhelming,

93
0:05:16.040 --> 0:05:18.560
lots of conversations going on,

94
0:05:18.560 --> 0:05:23.520
and they have a question or a doubt or maybe some feedback to give.

95
0:05:23.520 --> 0:05:26.960
They may not choose to do that in your chat if there's not a space for them,

96
0:05:26.960 --> 0:05:28.720
that they feel like their voice is going to be heard.

97
0:05:28.720 --> 0:05:30.960
So if it's this chaotic,

98
0:05:30.960 --> 0:05:32.640
loud cacophonous like chat,

99
0:05:32.640 --> 0:05:35.320
hey, what's going on, lots of things going on.

100
0:05:35.320 --> 0:05:37.720
They may be like, all right, no,

101
0:05:37.720 --> 0:05:40.120
I'm not going to be able to engage here.

102
0:05:41.000 --> 0:05:46.400
We really want to create a chat space that they can have these needs met.

103
0:05:48.400 --> 0:05:52.320
Of course, we're talking about interacting with these people,

104
0:05:52.320 --> 0:05:56.120
but there's 20 minutes going on.

105
0:05:56.120 --> 0:06:02.040
These are three characteristics of collaboration and communication with chat that I've identified

106
0:06:02.040 --> 0:06:07.920
as being core to serving open-source, open research projects.

107
0:06:07.920 --> 0:06:09.560
That's as well as live,

108
0:06:09.560 --> 0:06:12.280
having an asynchronous ability to chat,

109
0:06:12.280 --> 0:06:14.800
having an efficient chat experience,

110
0:06:14.800 --> 0:06:16.960
and having a transparent chat experience.

111
0:06:16.960 --> 0:06:22.680
So something that we're working on together.

112
0:06:22.680 --> 0:06:24.640
So going back to Zulip, again,

113
0:06:24.640 --> 0:06:27.720
I'm a contributor to the Zulip open-source project.

114
0:06:27.720 --> 0:06:29.560
It's 100 percent open-source,

115
0:06:29.560 --> 0:06:32.080
modern chat application.

116
0:06:32.080 --> 0:06:34.760
We have many contributors from all over the world,

117
0:06:34.760 --> 0:06:38.280
lots of people making their first time contribution to open-source

118
0:06:38.280 --> 0:06:41.960
through an internship program like Outreachy,

119
0:06:41.960 --> 0:06:43.600
or Google Summer of Code,

120
0:06:43.600 --> 0:06:46.480
or just for their own interests.

121
0:06:47.040 --> 0:06:50.000
Folks can choose to self-host,

122
0:06:50.000 --> 0:06:53.840
obviously open-source their own server with their own chat application,

123
0:06:53.840 --> 0:06:59.520
or we also host Zulip Cloud for folks who want to be organizations on the Cloud.

124
0:06:59.520 --> 0:07:08.240
So let's start talking about tackling those characteristics that I talked about.

125
0:07:08.240 --> 0:07:12.640
So Zulip has this unique topic-based threading model.

126
0:07:12.640 --> 0:07:15.520
So you're probably familiar from chat applications,

127
0:07:15.520 --> 0:07:18.280
who has, everyone has a chat application they're using,

128
0:07:18.280 --> 0:07:21.600
right, with some shape or other on their phone or whatnot.

129
0:07:21.600 --> 0:07:24.160
So we have maybe, we call them in Zulip,

130
0:07:24.160 --> 0:07:25.560
we call them streams.

131
0:07:25.560 --> 0:07:29.680
You might be familiar with channels or rooms,

132
0:07:29.680 --> 0:07:34.920
and this is the big buckets that we set out for conversations that we're having.

133
0:07:34.920 --> 0:07:42.080
The thing about Zulip is we create another layer of context in our streams.

134
0:07:42.080 --> 0:07:48.480
So for example, I have an image here of a stream for our annual summit that we're having.

135
0:07:48.480 --> 0:07:51.320
We're going to have a great time at our annual summit,

136
0:07:51.320 --> 0:07:54.680
and we've actually within our annual summit conversation,

137
0:07:54.680 --> 0:08:00.080
our stream, we have topics that are coming in and binding those groups of conversations together,

138
0:08:00.080 --> 0:08:02.840
kind of like an email subject line would have.

139
0:08:02.840 --> 0:08:05.560
So it's the end of my day.

140
0:08:05.560 --> 0:08:11.200
I've just got my CI passing on my issue.

141
0:08:11.200 --> 0:08:13.240
I'm super excited, but I'm going to sign off.

142
0:08:13.240 --> 0:08:15.160
But I signed into chat just before I go,

143
0:08:15.160 --> 0:08:19.040
and I look and I have 78 unread messages in my annual summit stream.

144
0:08:19.040 --> 0:08:21.160
I was supposed to check in about this today,

145
0:08:21.160 --> 0:08:24.440
and I'm looking through and I open up the topics and I say,

146
0:08:24.440 --> 0:08:30.240
you know what, they're having a very lively discussion about a bouncy castle at our annual summit.

147
0:08:30.240 --> 0:08:34.320
But you know what? I don't like bouncy castles.

148
0:08:34.320 --> 0:08:36.720
I could care less about the bouncy castle.

149
0:08:36.720 --> 0:08:38.600
I have no interest in bouncy castle.

150
0:08:38.600 --> 0:08:43.000
I'm not going to be jumping in the bouncy castle at the summit.

151
0:08:43.000 --> 0:08:46.720
So that is 48 messages that I know right there from the topic.

152
0:08:46.720 --> 0:08:48.680
I don't need to read right now.

153
0:08:48.680 --> 0:08:50.480
I can save those for later.

154
0:08:50.480 --> 0:08:53.720
I can mark them unread now, whatever I'd like to do.

155
0:08:53.720 --> 0:08:55.800
But I can look at these topics and say, you know what?

156
0:08:55.800 --> 0:08:59.080
I'm really interested in the catering because I know some people attending

157
0:08:59.080 --> 0:09:02.160
our summit have some nut allergies that are very severe.

158
0:09:02.160 --> 0:09:06.440
I want to make sure that's part of this discussion focused on our catering.

159
0:09:06.440 --> 0:09:11.760
So I'm going to look at that topic and that focus conversation context there.

160
0:09:11.760 --> 0:09:16.200
If no one's brought that up in those four different messages,

161
0:09:16.200 --> 0:09:18.320
then I'm going to put in a pertinent question there.

162
0:09:18.320 --> 0:09:21.000
Hey, do we know that people are coming with nut allergies?

163
0:09:21.000 --> 0:09:24.320
Are we making sure our catering is accommodating that need?

164
0:09:24.320 --> 0:09:28.640
So by reading through my topics, topic by topic,

165
0:09:28.640 --> 0:09:31.360
I can focus on what my interests are,

166
0:09:31.360 --> 0:09:34.000
where I can add value to the chat,

167
0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:37.360
and it makes the whole experience much more manageable.

168
0:09:37.360 --> 0:09:40.480
So topics really make asynchronous chat work.

169
0:09:40.480 --> 0:09:45.520
We now have folks all over the globe who can participate with

170
0:09:45.520 --> 0:09:50.720
more contextual feedback when they're online.

171
0:09:50.720 --> 0:09:54.640
So again, they really care about that bouncy conversation that happened.

172
0:09:54.640 --> 0:09:57.640
They can still jump in and add their feedback there.

173
0:09:57.640 --> 0:10:02.120
Again, we make some space for people whose voices might get lost,

174
0:10:02.120 --> 0:10:10.280
new folks and users, and so chat becomes more useful for them.

175
0:10:10.280 --> 0:10:15.440
But of course, topics are being used by humans.

176
0:10:15.440 --> 0:10:17.640
Humans do not always work.

177
0:10:17.640 --> 0:10:20.080
We don't have conversations in straight lines.

178
0:10:20.080 --> 0:10:22.400
We don't always make sense all the time.

179
0:10:22.400 --> 0:10:26.080
And we need to make sure that they work with the humans that are working with them.

180
0:10:26.080 --> 0:10:29.840
So at Zulip, we've made a number of tools to work with

181
0:10:29.840 --> 0:10:32.600
the patterns of conversations that we have.

182
0:10:32.600 --> 0:10:38.080
So for example, maybe we have this new feature we're implementing,

183
0:10:38.080 --> 0:10:41.720
we're having this really intense design conversation in our design stream,

184
0:10:41.720 --> 0:10:44.960
and somebody has this really great new idea right here.

185
0:10:44.960 --> 0:10:47.520
What we're going to do is take that new idea message,

186
0:10:47.520 --> 0:10:50.280
we're going to move it over here to its own topic with the new idea.

187
0:10:50.280 --> 0:10:55.080
We're going to create a link between these two topics in the same stream for the design.

188
0:10:55.080 --> 0:10:57.840
And now we have two parallel topic conversations going on in

189
0:10:57.840 --> 0:11:00.760
the same stream about design that have context.

190
0:11:00.760 --> 0:11:04.200
We can go back, we can connect them.

191
0:11:04.920 --> 0:11:09.040
Maybe we're having this really intense conversation about the new release,

192
0:11:09.040 --> 0:11:11.280
and we have a really excited new contributor jump in and say,

193
0:11:11.280 --> 0:11:13.640
hey, my name is and I'm really excited.

194
0:11:13.640 --> 0:11:15.240
And what do we do? How do I get things done?

195
0:11:15.240 --> 0:11:19.200
And we can take that message, move it over to the new person stream,

196
0:11:19.200 --> 0:11:22.000
say introductions, hi, welcome, we're so glad you're here.

197
0:11:22.000 --> 0:11:24.400
Please read our documentation, let us know if you have questions.

198
0:11:24.400 --> 0:11:26.840
And this really important release conversation that's going on in

199
0:11:26.840 --> 0:11:32.840
our release stream continues uninterrupted and we keep our flow organized and efficient.

200
0:11:32.840 --> 0:11:38.320
Maybe you have some come in with a help question, right?

201
0:11:38.320 --> 0:11:39.600
They're asking for help.

202
0:11:39.600 --> 0:11:42.800
They're working on upgrading to the new release.

203
0:11:42.800 --> 0:11:44.960
They have some questions, they've had some issues.

204
0:11:44.960 --> 0:11:48.400
Some of our sysops who look it on,

205
0:11:48.400 --> 0:11:53.160
work with them with a question and they come to a resolution.

206
0:11:53.160 --> 0:11:56.520
That user can then mark that topic as resolved.

207
0:11:56.520 --> 0:11:59.640
A big check mark will show up in front of that topic visually.

208
0:11:59.640 --> 0:12:03.520
And now we know that that question has been answered and resolved.

209
0:12:03.520 --> 0:12:05.760
And so we have this kind of,

210
0:12:05.920 --> 0:12:14.080
they have the ability to step out and say,

211
0:12:14.080 --> 0:12:17.760
hey, you know what, my question was answered, thank you so much.

212
0:12:17.760 --> 0:12:18.960
This is done.

213
0:12:18.960 --> 0:12:25.520
So again, creating organization within our topics makes things more efficient.

214
0:12:25.520 --> 0:12:27.840
People can prioritize their time,

215
0:12:27.840 --> 0:12:30.400
we can move conversations forward,

216
0:12:30.400 --> 0:12:33.560
and people have agency to say, thank you, I'm done.

217
0:12:33.560 --> 0:12:36.680
Or, hey, this unresolved this topic,

218
0:12:36.680 --> 0:12:40.440
we thought we fixed it, but we didn't, it's still an issue, let's unresolved it.

219
0:12:40.440 --> 0:12:42.240
And we're building up all of this,

220
0:12:42.240 --> 0:12:44.720
these conversations are happening, they're branching off here,

221
0:12:44.720 --> 0:12:46.240
they're branching off there, they're branching out there.

222
0:12:46.240 --> 0:12:48.720
We built this big tree, this repository of knowledge.

223
0:12:48.720 --> 0:12:50.800
Now our chat is not something ephemeral,

224
0:12:50.800 --> 0:12:51.800
happening in the moment.

225
0:12:51.800 --> 0:12:54.800
We're really starting to create a repository of

226
0:12:54.800 --> 0:12:57.080
knowledge that's there for everyone to share.

227
0:12:57.080 --> 0:13:00.520
So we've got this asynchronous conversations,

228
0:13:00.520 --> 0:13:02.800
we've got this repository of knowledge.

229
0:13:02.800 --> 0:13:04.720
What about the transparency?

230
0:13:04.720 --> 0:13:09.720
Right? So in our most recent Zillip release in November,

231
0:13:09.720 --> 0:13:14.000
6.0, our public access feature was landed.

232
0:13:14.000 --> 0:13:18.840
And what public access makes basically is,

233
0:13:18.840 --> 0:13:22.120
is an organization with a Zillip can decide, you know what?

234
0:13:22.120 --> 0:13:23.840
That help stream we have,

235
0:13:23.840 --> 0:13:26.320
that's really important information we want to share with everyone.

236
0:13:26.320 --> 0:13:27.880
So we're going to make that web public,

237
0:13:27.880 --> 0:13:31.560
which basically means that anyone on the Internet can access

238
0:13:31.560 --> 0:13:35.920
those conversations without signing in and without logging into your Zillip.

239
0:13:35.920 --> 0:13:40.360
So that now is information that's on the Internet available to anyone.

240
0:13:40.360 --> 0:13:43.840
Whatever their questions are, whatever, however they get there,

241
0:13:43.840 --> 0:13:45.880
they can start accessing that information,

242
0:13:45.880 --> 0:13:47.400
those help questions right away.

243
0:13:47.400 --> 0:13:51.080
Maybe we have our design conversations and we don't put those in a public.

244
0:13:51.080 --> 0:13:53.600
So people know what is our design ethic,

245
0:13:53.600 --> 0:13:55.520
where are we moving, what are we working on?

246
0:13:55.520 --> 0:13:59.000
And we can make that web public and people can engage.

247
0:13:59.200 --> 0:14:02.400
Maybe we've had this really great conversation about

248
0:14:02.400 --> 0:14:05.600
a new feature that we're implementing in our chat,

249
0:14:05.600 --> 0:14:10.040
and we have over here in GitLab our issue tracker for that feature.

250
0:14:10.040 --> 0:14:11.640
We can actually now,

251
0:14:11.640 --> 0:14:14.640
if that conversation happened on a web public stream,

252
0:14:14.640 --> 0:14:17.880
we can take that, make a link to the chat.

253
0:14:17.880 --> 0:14:21.360
And again, anyone who gets to GitLab and looks at our issue and says,

254
0:14:21.360 --> 0:14:22.960
oh, there's more information here,

255
0:14:22.960 --> 0:14:25.520
click relevant chat conversation and now all of

256
0:14:25.520 --> 0:14:28.680
that information without logging in is available to that person.

257
0:14:28.680 --> 0:14:33.080
So again, we're really taking our chat with the public access and moving it beyond

258
0:14:33.080 --> 0:14:38.080
our community and making it relevant to anyone who's curious about our open source,

259
0:14:38.080 --> 0:14:40.280
our open research projects, like what we're doing.

260
0:14:40.280 --> 0:14:43.880
This is a value of open source that we have.

261
0:14:43.880 --> 0:14:46.960
So again, if we're making decisions in chat,

262
0:14:46.960 --> 0:14:49.200
this is available for people to see.

263
0:14:49.200 --> 0:14:53.440
New community members can start learning before they even sign up.

264
0:14:53.440 --> 0:14:55.600
And we have this repository,

265
0:14:55.600 --> 0:15:00.960
this tree of knowledge that we built that's now out there in the wild,

266
0:15:00.960 --> 0:15:05.040
in the forest of the Internet that we have that we're sharing with everyone.

267
0:15:05.040 --> 0:15:10.480
So really creating that transparent and chats becoming much more

268
0:15:10.480 --> 0:15:15.160
relevant beyond just an ephemerable conversation.

269
0:15:15.160 --> 0:15:18.800
So as I mentioned, Zulip is 100 percent open source,

270
0:15:18.800 --> 0:15:21.800
free, you can start your own server.

271
0:15:21.800 --> 0:15:26.120
And we also have our Zulip Cloud which has a free level of support.

272
0:15:26.120 --> 0:15:30.720
Similarly to Slack before they made their change this summer,

273
0:15:30.720 --> 0:15:31.840
which is like limited,

274
0:15:31.840 --> 0:15:34.840
you have a certain history of messages.

275
0:15:35.000 --> 0:15:38.640
With non-profits, open source projects,

276
0:15:38.640 --> 0:15:42.920
academic research, we actually offer sponsorship on our Zulip Cloud standard,

277
0:15:42.920 --> 0:15:44.440
which is normally a paid platform.

278
0:15:44.440 --> 0:15:47.800
So you get even more history available to the public.

279
0:15:47.800 --> 0:15:49.200
It's not limited.

280
0:15:49.200 --> 0:15:50.920
That public access is there.

281
0:15:50.920 --> 0:15:56.920
So we really are committed to being part of the open source community.

282
0:15:56.920 --> 0:16:02.840
And making sure that all of our projects have great connection,

283
0:16:02.840 --> 0:16:05.600
collaboration, and are engaging all of the people who

284
0:16:05.600 --> 0:16:08.120
want to be involved in the organizations.

285
0:16:08.120 --> 0:16:09.760
Again, thank you so much.

286
0:16:09.760 --> 0:16:10.760
That's about it for me.

287
0:16:10.760 --> 0:16:13.360
I have some great links that are in the slides here.

288
0:16:13.360 --> 0:16:15.960
The community's directory is a directory of

289
0:16:15.960 --> 0:16:19.680
organizations on Zulip that have opted into the public access already.

290
0:16:19.680 --> 0:16:22.400
So if you're curious, that's a great place to start looking.

291
0:16:22.400 --> 0:16:24.600
You can find me at Zulip Development Community.

292
0:16:24.600 --> 0:16:26.960
That's where we are talking about Zulip and

293
0:16:26.960 --> 0:16:29.840
the features that we're implementing and what we're doing.

294
0:16:29.840 --> 0:16:32.360
We have some case studies, etc.

295
0:16:32.360 --> 0:16:37.640
So I want to open it to questions or I can jump into one of

296
0:16:37.640 --> 0:16:40.320
these open Zulip instances if anyone's interested.

297
0:16:40.320 --> 0:16:41.720
Yeah. So thank you.

298
0:16:41.720 --> 0:16:42.720
Thank you.

299
0:16:42.720 --> 0:16:48.720
Yes.

300
0:16:48.720 --> 0:16:54.920
So for topics to work efficiently, you need to be really strict with

301
0:16:54.920 --> 0:16:56.920
moving messages around.

302
0:16:56.920 --> 0:17:01.520
And that means that moderators, I guess,

303
0:17:01.520 --> 0:17:07.000
would have to scan every message and move things around.

304
0:17:07.000 --> 0:17:07.720
Yeah, yeah.

305
0:17:07.720 --> 0:17:10.640
So the question is, for topics to work and

306
0:17:10.640 --> 0:17:14.520
removing things around and when people come in,

307
0:17:14.520 --> 0:17:18.360
you take on a lot of moderators who have to kind of be very active and

308
0:17:18.360 --> 0:17:20.320
efficient in that.

309
0:17:20.320 --> 0:17:24.640
Yes, definitely my experience in Zulip Cloud.

310
0:17:24.640 --> 0:17:25.920
It depends on your organization.

311
0:17:25.920 --> 0:17:27.560
You can actually set that up.

312
0:17:27.560 --> 0:17:32.000
So for example, just moving topics within the same stream,

313
0:17:32.000 --> 0:17:34.040
like maybe somebody didn't name it very well.

314
0:17:34.040 --> 0:17:39.480
You can actually set that permission level to a generic user right now.

315
0:17:39.480 --> 0:17:41.480
And we're actually working on our user groups so

316
0:17:41.480 --> 0:17:46.560
that they can be even more designed to be unique to the organization.

317
0:17:46.560 --> 0:17:51.600
So those permissions can kind of be shared throughout your user base.

318
0:17:51.600 --> 0:17:54.280
So we actually have this in our New Year's.

319
0:17:54.280 --> 0:17:58.920
There's a lot of times we're coming in and to Zulip who want to contribute.

320
0:17:58.920 --> 0:18:02.360
And they're sending messages in very quickly.

321
0:18:02.360 --> 0:18:06.600
They'll start actually, if they see a message kind of go jump into a stream and

322
0:18:06.600 --> 0:18:09.400
interrupt a conversation, they'll even just move that out, right?

323
0:18:09.400 --> 0:18:12.240
As a person maybe who was there for two weeks.

324
0:18:12.240 --> 0:18:16.800
But it does require that kind of communal engagement.

325
0:18:16.800 --> 0:18:18.080
But you can disperse that so

326
0:18:18.080 --> 0:18:20.880
it's not just on your core contributors or your moderators.

327
0:18:20.880 --> 0:18:23.360
It can kind of be dispersed and hopefully with user groups,

328
0:18:23.360 --> 0:18:25.920
which is a feature that we're working on and planning.

329
0:18:25.920 --> 0:18:29.160
That'll be even more, can be fine tuned to your organization and

330
0:18:29.160 --> 0:18:33.520
how the community you want to create with your Zulip chat.

331
0:18:33.520 --> 0:18:34.520
Other questions?

332
0:18:34.520 --> 0:18:35.520
Yes.

333
0:18:35.520 --> 0:18:42.880
It's a big one, but the feature that we shared content with the public,

334
0:18:42.880 --> 0:18:44.760
it's really interesting.

335
0:18:44.760 --> 0:18:47.960
But I was wondering, how do you handle privacy?

336
0:18:47.960 --> 0:18:54.960
And is there a way that you can control this kind of things?

337
0:18:54.960 --> 0:18:58.040
Right, so each Zulip organization is deciding.

338
0:18:58.040 --> 0:19:02.160
So the question is, how do you control privacy with public streams and

339
0:19:02.160 --> 0:19:05.480
what's going on for the folks listening at home?

340
0:19:05.480 --> 0:19:09.680
So definitely your organization is deciding what streams are web public,

341
0:19:09.680 --> 0:19:10.200
right?

342
0:19:10.200 --> 0:19:15.360
So that is definitely kind of when you sign on and you're posting in those

343
0:19:15.360 --> 0:19:20.360
streams, it's kind of like this information is available in general on the internet.

344
0:19:21.560 --> 0:19:23.320
There are private streams in Zulip.

345
0:19:23.320 --> 0:19:26.320
There are streams that are public within your Zulip organization that people

346
0:19:26.320 --> 0:19:26.880
have to sign in.

347
0:19:26.880 --> 0:19:30.720
So for example, on our Zulip development community,

348
0:19:30.720 --> 0:19:37.360
the stream for asking help for new contributors, getting help with development,

349
0:19:37.360 --> 0:19:38.520
that's not a web public stream.

350
0:19:38.520 --> 0:19:41.680
Because that's kind of folks being vulnerable and maybe asking questions and

351
0:19:41.680 --> 0:19:44.640
saying, I don't know how to do this, can someone help?

352
0:19:44.640 --> 0:19:47.280
Obviously, that's not something, I mean, that's super brave of them and

353
0:19:47.280 --> 0:19:50.600
we're proud, we want that as public within our organization.

354
0:19:50.600 --> 0:19:52.200
But we're not sending that out to the internet.

355
0:19:52.200 --> 0:19:55.480
So we've made that choice culturally as an organization.

356
0:19:55.480 --> 0:19:57.800
So each organization that decides.

357
0:19:57.800 --> 0:20:01.480
So I believe the REST language that's using the public access feature,

358
0:20:01.480 --> 0:20:04.320
they've decided that all of their streams are web public.

359
0:20:04.320 --> 0:20:09.160
So basically, when you sign up to be part of that chat discussion on the REST

360
0:20:09.160 --> 0:20:12.760
language community, whatever discussion you're having there is available on

361
0:20:12.760 --> 0:20:13.800
the internet.

362
0:20:13.800 --> 0:20:18.400
And so that's just part of the culture of each organization that you're setting up.

363
0:20:18.400 --> 0:20:22.600
You can definitely set it up so there are more privacy focused organizations.

364
0:20:22.600 --> 0:20:25.040
But again, thinking about open source communities and

365
0:20:25.040 --> 0:20:28.360
the fact that we want to be having, there are definitely certain parts of our

366
0:20:28.360 --> 0:20:32.880
conversations and chats that we might want to be having as publicly as possible, right?

367
0:20:32.880 --> 0:20:33.640
So, yeah.

368
0:20:35.360 --> 0:20:37.240
Any other questions?

369
0:20:37.240 --> 0:20:38.400
Yes.

370
0:20:38.400 --> 0:20:41.280
Do you have any integration API?

371
0:20:41.280 --> 0:20:43.640
Yes, yes, we have lots of integrations.

372
0:20:43.640 --> 0:20:53.040
I mean, it's just my company, they try to remove a slack and use things.

373
0:20:53.040 --> 0:20:56.040
And only engineers say, what was that?

374
0:20:56.040 --> 0:20:57.920
It's useless.

375
0:20:57.920 --> 0:21:02.400
So I guess that you have also this kind of integration.

376
0:21:02.400 --> 0:21:07.120
Right, yeah, so you can move from Slack to Zulip, for instance.

377
0:21:07.120 --> 0:21:09.760
Or GitHub to Zulip and so on.

378
0:21:09.760 --> 0:21:10.320
Yes, yes.

379
0:21:10.320 --> 0:21:14.640
Well, GitHub for tracking issues and Zulip as a chat application work together, yeah.

380
0:21:14.640 --> 0:21:21.440
So we track our, we're on GitHub for our open source,

381
0:21:21.440 --> 0:21:24.800
that's where our code is, and so our issues link and

382
0:21:24.800 --> 0:21:28.120
we use integrations for bots to communicate and stuff.

383
0:21:28.120 --> 0:21:31.080
So, but definitely there are lots of integrations and

384
0:21:31.080 --> 0:21:36.120
such that one can use, lots of different authentication methods, etc.

385
0:21:36.120 --> 0:21:38.840
It's a fully fledged modern chat app.

386
0:21:38.840 --> 0:21:39.360
Yeah.

387
0:21:40.400 --> 0:21:42.120
Other questions?

388
0:21:42.120 --> 0:21:43.680
Curiosity.

389
0:21:43.680 --> 0:21:44.800
Again, if your, your,

390
0:21:44.800 --> 0:21:49.520
QISU's been for your open source projects, please, I'll be around tomorrow or

391
0:21:49.520 --> 0:21:52.080
come on the Zulip development community, check us out.

392
0:21:52.080 --> 0:21:56.120
We have lots of public streams and I'm just been really excited to see everyone

393
0:21:56.120 --> 0:22:20.080
here at Fostom, and thank you for having me.
