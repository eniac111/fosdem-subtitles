0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:07.000
Hello, thanks everybody for coming. I will be talking today about what we know about

2
0:00:09.760 --> 0:00:16.480
how Firefox uses power, what we can know about it, what we can do about it. First, what we

3
0:00:16.480 --> 0:00:21.480
will cover today. So first, why do we care about this topic? Then how can we understand

4
0:00:21.480 --> 0:00:25.920
power used locally, which means like if Firefox is using too much power on your own computer,

5
0:00:25.920 --> 0:00:30.360
what can you do about it? And then how can we understand it about all users in general

6
0:00:30.360 --> 0:00:34.920
in the world, so the entire race populations? And I will finish by explaining what we have

7
0:00:34.920 --> 0:00:40.800
done, what we have improved and what we are still doing. So first, why do we care? There

8
0:00:40.800 --> 0:00:45.840
are really two different sets of reasons. The first one is user experience. We very

9
0:00:45.840 --> 0:00:50.280
frequently see users complaining that, okay, Firefox is using too much resources, too much

10
0:00:50.280 --> 0:00:55.320
CPU. My computer is noisy, like the fans are making noise, they are going at full speed.

11
0:00:55.320 --> 0:01:01.040
Or laptop is hot, if people are using a laptop. Or maybe the battery life is too short. So

12
0:01:01.040 --> 0:01:06.160
all of those are reasons for an individual to want to use less power. There is another

13
0:01:06.160 --> 0:01:11.720
set of reasons, which is sustainability. Mozilla cares about sustainability, made climate

14
0:01:11.720 --> 0:01:18.720
commitments about being carbon neutral, about producing your greenhouse gas footprint. And

15
0:01:18.760 --> 0:01:23.200
because we are Mozilla, we do things in the open. We want to lead on this and do it openly.

16
0:01:23.200 --> 0:01:28.480
We want to share our tools, any material we have on this, methodologies. And also we want

17
0:01:28.480 --> 0:01:34.320
to improve our products so that they are more sustainable. And the reason why we care so

18
0:01:34.320 --> 0:01:39.800
much about our product is because when estimating our carbon footprint, because we have many

19
0:01:39.800 --> 0:01:46.480
users, the use of our product is actually 98% of our footprint. So playing less, having

20
0:01:46.480 --> 0:01:50.840
more efficient offices, this is all very great, but if we want to save a lot of power, that's

21
0:01:50.840 --> 0:01:56.120
really looking at the product that we should look at.

22
0:01:56.120 --> 0:02:00.320
So I said we will look locally first because I think there are some people in the room

23
0:02:00.320 --> 0:02:03.760
who likely think, Firefox uses too much power on my computer, I want the battery to last

24
0:02:03.760 --> 0:02:08.040
longer, and that's a very valued use case. And if we want to optimize for everybody,

25
0:02:08.040 --> 0:02:12.400
we want first to be able to optimize to have it running correctly on one specific machine

26
0:02:12.400 --> 0:02:16.520
in front of us before trying to go at scale. So I will present a few tools that we have

27
0:02:16.520 --> 0:02:22.720
for this. But first I will explain how Firefox uses power. It's desktop applications, so

28
0:02:22.720 --> 0:02:28.800
like any other computer application, it's using CPU time, using GPU time, waking up

29
0:02:28.800 --> 0:02:33.160
CPUs, and actually CPUs are pretty good at saving power when we ask them to do nothing.

30
0:02:33.160 --> 0:02:37.440
They go into deep sleep mode, they use almost no power. The problem is if we keep waking

31
0:02:37.440 --> 0:02:41.680
them up, they can't really sleep, and that wastes a lot of power. And then there's a

32
0:02:41.680 --> 0:02:46.480
few more things that we can do that use a little bit of power but not as much, like

33
0:02:46.480 --> 0:02:50.680
transmitting network packets, for example, or writing to disks. And they are not where

34
0:02:50.680 --> 0:02:56.120
we should focus our time if we really want to have a big impact. So this is how we use

35
0:02:56.120 --> 0:03:00.440
power. And next, how we waste power. It's almost the same thing, the only difference

36
0:03:00.440 --> 0:03:06.120
is when we do it for no user benefit. If we use CPU time and the user doesn't see a benefit

37
0:03:06.120 --> 0:03:10.360
in what we are doing with the CPU, it's a waste. And same for all the other ways we

38
0:03:10.360 --> 0:03:17.480
could use resources. And some typical ways to waste power is waking up threads too often,

39
0:03:17.480 --> 0:03:22.240
playing animations even though they are completely invisible, or more generally doing things

40
0:03:22.240 --> 0:03:32.560
in the background, things that have no visible effects. So typically when someone wants to

41
0:03:32.560 --> 0:03:37.560
understand local power use, there's two reasons. Either Firefox is supposed to be guilty of

42
0:03:37.560 --> 0:03:42.200
using too much power, there's like one core used at 100%, sometimes even more than one

43
0:03:42.200 --> 0:03:47.720
core. Or sometimes the user is looking at the operating system task manager for a completely

44
0:03:47.720 --> 0:03:54.400
different reason and notices that, okay, there are some Firefox processes that should be

45
0:03:54.400 --> 0:03:57.400
idle because Firefox is supposed to be doing nothing, it's in the background, but it's

46
0:03:57.400 --> 0:04:05.240
using 1% of the CPU or 0. something. Why? It used to be difficult to figure out answers

47
0:04:05.240 --> 0:04:09.120
to those questions, we now have good tooling for it. So the first tool I wanted to share

48
0:04:09.120 --> 0:04:14.840
is the Firefox task manager. You can open it by typing about processes in the address

49
0:04:14.840 --> 0:04:21.240
bar. You can also use the shift escape keyboard shortcut that will open it directly. And it's

50
0:04:21.240 --> 0:04:25.520
very similar to a task manager you would see in an operating system. It's showing you a

51
0:04:25.520 --> 0:04:33.760
list of processes, how much memory is used by each, how much memory and CPU. But unlike

52
0:04:33.760 --> 0:04:37.800
the operating system, it knows exactly which tab we are loading in which process. So if

53
0:04:37.800 --> 0:04:42.040
you see that there's one process that's using a lot of CPU, and you see that it's a tab

54
0:04:42.040 --> 0:04:45.760
that you actually don't really care about, you can just close that tab and this is done.

55
0:04:45.760 --> 0:04:49.520
Because very often we have people who say, oh, Firefox is a lot of CPU, but you know

56
0:04:49.520 --> 0:04:54.600
I have 50 tabs, so maybe it's because we've made it have Firefox is a lot. Naturally,

57
0:04:54.600 --> 0:04:58.000
very often it's just there's one tab that's misbehaving, and finding quickly the right

58
0:04:58.000 --> 0:05:03.040
one and closing it is the most efficient way to fix it. Something else I want to show on

59
0:05:03.040 --> 0:05:09.080
this is that the numbers, the percentage of CPU's are very precious here. A lot more than

60
0:05:09.080 --> 0:05:14.920
on the operating system task managers. For example, on the third process here you see

61
0:05:14.920 --> 0:05:21.080
0.0, 11 percent. On the operating system you just see 0 in this case. And the reason why

62
0:05:21.080 --> 0:05:25.200
we want to show it when it's almost nothing is because almost nothing means we are still

63
0:05:25.200 --> 0:05:30.480
waking up the CPU to do a little bit of something. And we want to be able to catch this. Because

64
0:05:30.480 --> 0:05:35.280
we use this kind of tooling to find real bugs. This is a screenshot captured on Nike. If

65
0:05:35.280 --> 0:05:38.920
you are on a release build you won't see the thread names unless you enable it in about

66
0:05:38.920 --> 0:05:46.640
config. Okay, so let's assume you have found that there's a real problem there and it's

67
0:05:46.640 --> 0:05:50.960
not a tab you can easily close. The next step, which is more in the tooling, is using the

68
0:05:50.960 --> 0:05:55.440
Firefox profiler. I won't go into details on the Firefox profiler because the next presentation

69
0:05:55.440 --> 0:06:00.640
is also about the profiler. But I will say that we recently added a preset for power

70
0:06:00.640 --> 0:06:06.480
profiling which configures the profiler in a way that causes very little overhead. And

71
0:06:06.480 --> 0:06:12.240
we also have a power profiling mode that was added recently that will be able to say how

72
0:06:12.240 --> 0:06:20.560
many watts we used, not just how much CPU. So you can enable it quickly with this preset.

73
0:06:20.560 --> 0:06:26.160
I just wanted to show an example of how precise the measurement can be. This is a profile

74
0:06:26.160 --> 0:06:31.800
showing Firefox doing nothing. There was just one thing that was left. It was the cursor

75
0:06:31.800 --> 0:06:37.440
in the address bar. It was blinking. On all the spikes that you can see in here, they

76
0:06:37.440 --> 0:06:42.240
are whenever the cursor appears or disappears. And here we could select this area and see

77
0:06:42.240 --> 0:06:46.880
in the tool tip exactly how much power we used to do this tiny thing. So anything we

78
0:06:46.880 --> 0:06:53.560
do, we can see it in the profiler, see how much power we used and correlate. Honestly,

79
0:06:53.560 --> 0:06:57.720
I never thought we could see things like this. I thought we could see bigger things like

80
0:06:57.720 --> 0:07:03.200
loading a page but blinking the cursor, that was a surprise. And a good one. Another thing

81
0:07:03.200 --> 0:07:07.200
in the profiler that I wanted to share, and it's the last one because the next talk will

82
0:07:07.200 --> 0:07:11.520
be all about the profiler, is the profiler records many markers. And especially I wanted

83
0:07:11.520 --> 0:07:16.000
to show the awake and vulnerable markers that make it easy to see why we were waking up

84
0:07:16.000 --> 0:07:21.680
of thread. Whenever the thread wakes up, there's an awake marker. It often says which priority

85
0:07:21.680 --> 0:07:26.920
the thread was in from the operating system point of view and which core of a thing run.

86
0:07:26.920 --> 0:07:31.600
And runnable markers only exist on nightly but they say exactly what we run at that time,

87
0:07:31.600 --> 0:07:36.600
which is very convenient to then fail a bug if it's something we should not be running.

88
0:07:36.600 --> 0:07:43.840
One last thing there, task manager. If you hover with a mouse next to the PID, there's

89
0:07:43.840 --> 0:07:47.760
a profiler icon that appears. If you click it, it will profile for five seconds the entire

90
0:07:47.760 --> 0:07:51.200
process. A few seconds later, you will see a tab opening that shows everything happening

91
0:07:51.200 --> 0:07:58.560
in that process. That's all I will say about troubleshooting local excessive power use.

92
0:07:58.560 --> 0:08:02.840
I hope you will make good use of the tools I was just showing. And I will talk about

93
0:08:02.840 --> 0:08:07.800
what's happening in the wild. So that's for all our users. And whenever we care about

94
0:08:07.800 --> 0:08:12.640
what's happening for all users, we think telemetry because that's a great way to know about what's

95
0:08:12.640 --> 0:08:17.960
happening in computers that are not in front of us. I added data collection for a few things

96
0:08:17.960 --> 0:08:24.480
that I will use over the last couple months. Most notably CPU time used, GPU time used,

97
0:08:24.480 --> 0:08:30.200
the number of wake-ups that we caused. And also we can break down this data by process

98
0:08:30.200 --> 0:08:34.760
type. And here by process type, I mean is it the parent process that's showing the Firefox

99
0:08:34.760 --> 0:08:39.560
user interface? Is it a content process that's showing the tab in the foreground? A content

100
0:08:39.560 --> 0:08:46.360
process that's for background tab. On the native channel, we can even break it down

101
0:08:46.360 --> 0:08:51.600
by thread name, which is a lot more detailed. And I will show the use we are making of this

102
0:08:51.600 --> 0:08:58.040
data. So I said we care about sustainability and we have climate commitments. And one obvious

103
0:08:58.040 --> 0:09:03.440
use case for having this kind of data is estimating our carbon footprint. So thanks to the telemetry,

104
0:09:03.440 --> 0:09:09.520
we know that on average every day we use between 60 and 80 million hours of CPU time. And I

105
0:09:09.520 --> 0:09:14.240
mean about 15 million hours of GPU time. Those are big numbers. It's hard to think about

106
0:09:14.240 --> 0:09:20.160
what they mean. But we can try to use those numbers to convert to CO2 equivalent by using

107
0:09:20.160 --> 0:09:25.080
the CPU specifications from CPU manufacturers, information about which CPU model is being

108
0:09:25.080 --> 0:09:30.880
used, and electricity, carbon intensity by country. So we will be publishing our carbon

109
0:09:30.880 --> 0:09:36.560
footprint in a couple months for last year. And it's based on this kind of data. And I

110
0:09:36.560 --> 0:09:40.880
just wanted to give a sense of scale because millions of hours, that means nothing to me.

111
0:09:40.880 --> 0:09:45.240
The amount of power that could be needed to power Firefox for all of our users, which

112
0:09:45.240 --> 0:09:50.400
is hundreds of millions of users, would be equivalent of a small thermal power station.

113
0:09:50.400 --> 0:09:54.680
Or if you're thinking more renewable energy, we would need to cover about the roofs of

114
0:09:54.680 --> 0:10:02.080
50,000 houses with photovoltaic panels. So even if we save just 1% of the power, that

115
0:10:02.080 --> 0:10:08.760
still means a lot compared to other things we could do in our personal lives as engineers.

116
0:10:08.760 --> 0:10:13.600
Another example of using telemetry data is verifying that the fix we landed actually

117
0:10:13.600 --> 0:10:18.000
had the impact we expected. And this is a case where we fixed something related to how

118
0:10:18.000 --> 0:10:25.560
timers were implemented, timers for web pages. And this chart shows how many times we wake

119
0:10:25.560 --> 0:10:32.320
up various threads. So it's from native users. And you see that there's a change happening

120
0:10:32.320 --> 0:10:37.000
here, something trending down. Before, it was about 7% of the wake-ups for the time

121
0:10:37.000 --> 0:10:41.880
of thread. And after, it was about 5%. So we already had an impact with this fix. And

122
0:10:41.880 --> 0:10:47.760
before we collected this kind of telemetry, it would have been impossible to know. And

123
0:10:47.760 --> 0:10:51.760
last but not least, we used this telemetry to verify our ideas about how we can reduce

124
0:10:51.760 --> 0:10:57.080
power use. And when I started working on this project, I had the assumption, and other people

125
0:10:57.080 --> 0:11:02.040
too, that we use a lot of power in background tabs. And that's probably because as someone

126
0:11:02.040 --> 0:11:08.000
who uses Firefox and the internet a lot, I have many background tabs. And we just collected

127
0:11:08.000 --> 0:11:13.600
data. So this is a breakdown per process type. We see that the biggest slice here is the

128
0:11:13.600 --> 0:11:18.840
foreground tab, not background. Second biggest is the GPU, so showing things on screen. Then

129
0:11:18.840 --> 0:11:23.920
we've got the parent process, which is the UI, when the user is interacting or not interacting.

130
0:11:23.920 --> 0:11:30.160
And only then, we have background tabs. So it's between 7% and 8%. Still worth optimizing,

131
0:11:30.160 --> 0:11:34.840
but if we spent all of our efforts optimizing this, we would be missing the biggest part

132
0:11:34.840 --> 0:11:41.480
of the thing, which is foreground tabs. Another idea that we tested is, maybe it's all those

133
0:11:41.480 --> 0:11:45.320
ads that are on web pages. They use a lot of power. We should do something about them.

134
0:11:45.320 --> 0:11:49.400
We also collected data, it turns out to be less than 2% of the total. Maybe it's still

135
0:11:49.400 --> 0:11:53.680
worth doing something about it, but again, it's not where we have the biggest wins. And

136
0:11:53.680 --> 0:11:56.720
maybe it also means that tracking protection works very well in Firefox, and we are already

137
0:11:56.720 --> 0:12:04.720
blocking many things. And the last section of this presentation will be about improvements,

138
0:12:04.720 --> 0:12:11.840
what we have done to reduce power use, and what we can still do. We fixed many bugs.

139
0:12:11.840 --> 0:12:16.120
When I wrote this slide, it was 26 bugs that we fixed, only with the intent of reducing

140
0:12:16.120 --> 0:12:22.600
power use. But if I wrote this slide today, it would be 27, because one was fixed overnight.

141
0:12:22.600 --> 0:12:27.800
The bugs go in various categories. It's almost always the same kind of things that we find.

142
0:12:27.800 --> 0:12:30.800
Sometimes we have timers that really should have been stopped, but keep repeating, but

143
0:12:30.800 --> 0:12:35.560
they are not really useful. It's one of those bugs that we fixed this night, something that

144
0:12:35.560 --> 0:12:39.400
was waking up every 10 seconds, even when you do nothing with Firefox. I'm happy this

145
0:12:39.400 --> 0:12:46.280
bug is finally fixed. Sometimes it's animations that are animating, but they are animating

146
0:12:46.280 --> 0:12:50.240
stuff that's not even on screen. Maybe because it's a background window, background tab,

147
0:12:50.240 --> 0:12:55.280
or something hidden for some other reason. When we can stop those animations, it's much

148
0:12:55.280 --> 0:12:59.000
better. And when I said bogus animation, it's sometimes we have animations that kept running

149
0:12:59.000 --> 0:13:03.360
even though the window was closed. I think we fixed all of those cases, but we might

150
0:13:03.360 --> 0:13:08.120
still find more. And I wrote in pointless thread backups. That's what I was showing

151
0:13:08.120 --> 0:13:14.440
before with a chart about timer threads and HKZs where we have always massive CPUs. Thanks

152
0:13:14.440 --> 0:13:18.440
to all the contributors who helped with this, it's the work of many people mostly on the

153
0:13:18.440 --> 0:13:24.400
platform team. And I will just showcase a few examples of bug fixes we did that had

154
0:13:24.400 --> 0:13:29.720
a big impact. So this one is specifically about Windows 11. Windows 11 has an efficiency

155
0:13:29.720 --> 0:13:33.960
mode for processes. It's not completely clear what it does, but when reading the documentation,

156
0:13:33.960 --> 0:13:38.200
it's mostly letting the operating system know that this process is doing nothing that's

157
0:13:38.200 --> 0:13:44.600
user visible. So we could execute the CPU at the lowest possible frequency. And for

158
0:13:44.600 --> 0:13:50.640
CPUs with efficiency or performance scores, always select efficiency scores. And thanks

159
0:13:50.640 --> 0:13:54.040
to poor profiling that I mentioned before, we could actually verify the impact that we

160
0:13:54.040 --> 0:14:00.600
had when deciding that we set content processes for background tabs in efficiency mode. If

161
0:14:00.600 --> 0:14:04.840
you look at the slides later on, click the link, you can see it in the profile. But on

162
0:14:04.840 --> 0:14:09.960
my computer when I tested it divided by five, the power use of a tab using the CPU in the

163
0:14:09.960 --> 0:14:15.680
background continuously. Another thing I said, we have many bugs that are the same category

164
0:14:15.680 --> 0:14:21.400
of bug. And when we can, it's nice to eliminate the entire category of bugs at once. And for

165
0:14:21.400 --> 0:14:26.000
animation that are broken in HKZs, it's almost impossible to write tests for all the possible

166
0:14:26.000 --> 0:14:31.800
HKZs. But we have a very extensive test suite. So one idea I had was, what if at the end

167
0:14:31.800 --> 0:14:36.680
of every automated test we run, we verify that nothing is animating anymore? Sounds

168
0:14:36.680 --> 0:14:43.040
very easy. We did it. The part that was not easy was fixing all the HKZs we uncovered.

169
0:14:43.040 --> 0:14:49.200
But that's why I'm confident it won't regress as much as it used to. Next things we can

170
0:14:49.200 --> 0:14:54.880
do, because we still have many ideas of how we could do better. I mentioned background

171
0:14:54.880 --> 0:14:58.680
tabs. We still have lots of ideas about how background tabs could be more efficient, how

172
0:14:58.680 --> 0:15:02.920
we could be more aggressive about reducing the frequency of timers for hearing there,

173
0:15:02.920 --> 0:15:09.200
how we could limit CPU use there. I keep talking about timers, but there's a lot we can do

174
0:15:09.200 --> 0:15:12.760
about timers. And there's actually currently one engineer working full time and improving

175
0:15:12.760 --> 0:15:19.160
on timer APIs. The main idea there is to group timers. The most expensive part about timers

176
0:15:19.160 --> 0:15:23.240
is they wake up the CPU. So if when we do wake up the CPU, we decide to run many timers

177
0:15:23.240 --> 0:15:27.440
at once, it would be much cheaper in terms of power. And we are working on those kind

178
0:15:27.440 --> 0:15:33.320
of improvements. We still have cases where we have videos that are being decoded, but

179
0:15:33.320 --> 0:15:37.280
not played in a place where they are visible for users, like background tabs and things

180
0:15:37.280 --> 0:15:43.240
like that. We try to stop those, but there are cases that we are still working on. Hidden

181
0:15:43.240 --> 0:15:46.640
animations. So animations that keep running when something has been completely closed,

182
0:15:46.640 --> 0:15:50.720
I'm confident we fixed most of those. Animations that keep running even though they are covered

183
0:15:50.720 --> 0:15:56.000
by something else. We still have many cases. And the biggest one is fully occluded window,

184
0:15:56.000 --> 0:16:02.320
which is you have a window that's entirely above a browser window where we have animation.

185
0:16:02.320 --> 0:16:07.360
We try to detect that we have got to detect it at least on Mac and on Windows. It's not

186
0:16:07.360 --> 0:16:12.040
working as well as it should be. And I think we can do much better. So there's probably

187
0:16:12.040 --> 0:16:17.640
there will probably be we're going in that direction. And another thing that I like to

188
0:16:17.640 --> 0:16:22.120
do is to test the profile. Also because testing the capabilities of a profiler is what happens

189
0:16:22.120 --> 0:16:27.280
if Firefox is started and there's nothing. You open Firefox, you load about blank, literally

190
0:16:27.280 --> 0:16:31.360
nothing. And then you go to a meeting or go for a walk or do something else. And then

191
0:16:31.360 --> 0:16:35.600
you come back a few hours later, you capture the profile and you see what happens. I would

192
0:16:35.600 --> 0:16:40.640
like what happened to be almost nothing. It's currently still more than I would like. And

193
0:16:40.640 --> 0:16:44.600
we can still improve things there. And I think it would typically help for sustainability

194
0:16:44.600 --> 0:16:49.280
there for people who are not using laptops that tend to go into sleep mode, but more desktop

195
0:16:49.280 --> 0:16:53.400
computers that might turn on things on their computer. And then they go home for the night

196
0:16:53.400 --> 0:16:57.840
or for the weekend and the computer keeps running the entire weekend. I think it might

197
0:16:57.840 --> 0:17:04.760
have an impact for those cases. And some more ideas that are not ready to do something about

198
0:17:04.760 --> 0:17:09.800
for everybody, but that could be experimented with. Experiments you could run individually

199
0:17:09.800 --> 0:17:14.040
like if you want to test it for yourself. Or experiments we could run on a few thousand

200
0:17:14.040 --> 0:17:20.440
users to see what's the impact. So the preferences there that I'm giving is when showing the

201
0:17:20.440 --> 0:17:24.880
chart, I said that displaying the foreground tab is what's using almost half of the entire

202
0:17:24.880 --> 0:17:29.520
program that we use for Firefox. By default, we display stuff, especially animation 60

203
0:17:29.520 --> 0:17:35.080
times per second or more if you have a screen with a first stop refresh rate. Do you really

204
0:17:35.080 --> 0:17:40.520
need that? I think most people don't. And we have a pref to limit the refresh rate.

205
0:17:40.520 --> 0:17:46.200
So if you want to have only half the frames, just set it to 30 and you will see what happens.

206
0:17:46.200 --> 0:17:51.160
I think for most use cases, except maybe first video games, it should be fine. Another thing

207
0:17:51.160 --> 0:17:56.000
we'd like to explore is the cost of video autoplay. We already block videos that could

208
0:17:56.000 --> 0:18:00.200
make sound because it's noisy and that's annoying. But videos that are just there in a corner,

209
0:18:00.200 --> 0:18:03.880
typically news articles with someone waving hands and talking, but you can't hear them

210
0:18:03.880 --> 0:18:07.720
because you're reading the article and you don't care. They use a lot of power. We could

211
0:18:07.720 --> 0:18:13.000
probably stop that. And there's a price that you can set that will block both on the audio

212
0:18:13.000 --> 0:18:19.560
and there's video. Even if there's just video, it will block it. And that's all I wanted

213
0:18:19.560 --> 0:18:23.200
to share for today. And I'm happy to take questions if you have, but first, thanks for

214
0:18:23.200 --> 0:18:26.200
your attention.

215
0:18:26.200 --> 0:18:49.960
So who has any questions? In the case that you have a lot of background

216
0:18:49.960 --> 0:18:57.240
apps, does Firefox suspend those processes? And if so, does the memory gets freed and

217
0:18:57.240 --> 0:19:04.040
does with the process manager show that or not? Sorry, a lot of question.

218
0:19:04.040 --> 0:19:08.520
So the question is, if you have lots of background tabs, is Firefox suspending those processes?

219
0:19:08.520 --> 0:19:13.640
Is the memory getting freed? There are multiple answers to that question because there are

220
0:19:13.640 --> 0:19:18.120
different cases. By default, the answer is mostly no, we don't suspend them. One thing

221
0:19:18.120 --> 0:19:23.360
we do is we throttle any activity there. So if a tab is trying to do things every 10 milliseconds,

222
0:19:23.360 --> 0:19:27.720
we will not allow that. And we will limit to once per second, which saves a lot of power

223
0:19:27.720 --> 0:19:32.360
already. I think we can do better. I would like if it was only once per minute and then

224
0:19:32.360 --> 0:19:37.480
maybe after a few minutes or a few hours, suspend completely. There are cases where

225
0:19:37.480 --> 0:19:42.560
the tabs are completely unloaded. One of the cases when we are using way too much memory

226
0:19:42.560 --> 0:19:46.840
and we are about to crash out of memory, then we will, as a priority, unload the tab that's

227
0:19:46.840 --> 0:19:51.800
abusing the memory. There's another case, which is when you session restore, we don't

228
0:19:51.800 --> 0:19:55.440
reload the tab until you click them, except for the foreground tabs. So then you will

229
0:19:55.440 --> 0:20:00.080
have many tabs, but they don't actually use memory or power. And one more case is Firefox

230
0:20:00.080 --> 0:20:04.760
on Android. By the way, everything I said in this slide show was about Firefox desktop,

231
0:20:04.760 --> 0:20:08.720
but we are also looking at the power use of Firefox on Android. And on Android, when you

232
0:20:08.720 --> 0:20:11.520
put a tab in the background, it's completely suspended. Nothing runs anymore.

233
0:20:11.520 --> 0:20:23.560
Any other question? Okay. Can you just say it? So, okay.

234
0:20:23.560 --> 0:20:33.560
So I just tried to see what my Firefox is doing about processes that I just learned about.

235
0:20:33.560 --> 0:20:43.920
And the first line is the Firefox main process itself, which is my use of between 20 and

236
0:20:43.920 --> 0:20:48.440
50% of CPU. So that's not any of that. So do you have any idea what that is doing?

237
0:20:48.440 --> 0:20:52.360
So the question is, I just learned about about processes and quickly wanted to see what my

238
0:20:52.360 --> 0:20:57.760
Firefox was doing. And the process that's using the most CPU there is the parent process,

239
0:20:57.760 --> 0:21:04.120
which is using about 20% of the core. Do we have any idea of what it is doing? So the

240
0:21:04.120 --> 0:21:08.120
way I would figure this out is to click the profile icon and look at the profile. And

241
0:21:08.120 --> 0:21:11.600
if you want to send me that profile, I can tell you exactly. But otherwise I will just

242
0:21:11.600 --> 0:21:15.680
say a quick guess, which is what happens most of the time, is unless you are running on

243
0:21:15.680 --> 0:21:21.840
Windows, but I guess you're probably on Linux or something else, we run... So I said GPU

244
0:21:21.840 --> 0:21:26.640
process is a large part. We actually only have a GPU process on Windows to prevent graphics

245
0:21:26.640 --> 0:21:31.160
driver from crashing from crashing into your browser. So the graphics part happens on the

246
0:21:31.160 --> 0:21:36.320
parent process outside of Windows. And it's very likely that you have animations that

247
0:21:36.320 --> 0:21:40.280
are running and causing things to be displayed. And with a profile I could tell you which

248
0:21:40.280 --> 0:21:45.120
animations are running and why.

249
0:21:45.120 --> 0:21:51.240
We have questions here in the matrix room. Have somebody ever compared worldwide power

250
0:21:51.240 --> 0:21:57.000
usage of Firefox versus other proprietary browser webs?

251
0:21:57.000 --> 0:22:05.440
I missed a few ones. So worldwide power of Firefox compared to other browsers? Have we

252
0:22:05.440 --> 0:22:12.720
ever compared? I would say no, because I think the other browsers don't publish worldwide

253
0:22:12.720 --> 0:22:18.800
power use. And I'm hoping we'll be publishing this as part of our greenhouse gas footprint

254
0:22:18.800 --> 0:22:24.360
report. I don't think computing browsers publish any of that. And we were actually thinking

255
0:22:24.360 --> 0:22:27.400
that if we start publishing that maybe we will push the competition to also publish

256
0:22:27.400 --> 0:22:31.080
this kind of information.

257
0:22:31.080 --> 0:22:38.120
Great. Any other?

258
0:22:38.120 --> 0:22:45.600
So this is kind of an extension to the configuration options that you showed. But are there other

259
0:22:45.600 --> 0:22:52.000
tweakables that we could apply to Firefox on mobile devices? Like by and from Librem

260
0:22:52.000 --> 0:22:58.560
and so on where we definitely don't need 60 frames a second.

261
0:22:58.560 --> 0:23:02.680
I'm not sure I understand entirely, but I think you were asking other things that we

262
0:23:02.680 --> 0:23:04.880
could do on mobile to reduce power usage?

263
0:23:04.880 --> 0:23:13.960
Yes, but it is a mobile platform running on it. So it's the desktop version of Firefox.

264
0:23:13.960 --> 0:23:17.560
So you have a mobile device running the desktop version of Firefox. And you are wondering if

265
0:23:17.560 --> 0:23:23.760
there are things you could do to reduce power usage.

266
0:23:23.760 --> 0:23:27.320
If you are showing anyone try to eliminate entirely background apps and try to suspend

267
0:23:27.320 --> 0:23:33.960
them. Otherwise, the answer is almost always the same. Capture a profile, see what's in

268
0:23:33.960 --> 0:23:38.840
there. Because whenever we try to optimize by just guessing, almost all the time we are

269
0:23:38.840 --> 0:23:43.880
like I said, background apps, it's not that bad. And it's not that bad. And profiling is

270
0:23:43.880 --> 0:23:48.040
always the way to know exactly where you should be spending your time when you want to optimize.

271
0:23:48.040 --> 0:23:52.160
And if you want help with profiling, the next talk will be about the profiler. And we are

272
0:23:52.160 --> 0:23:56.120
very happy to help about understanding profiles.

273
0:23:56.120 --> 0:24:06.760
Hi. My question is regarding hardware encoding. For example, in HTML and depending on the

274
0:24:06.760 --> 0:24:13.840
user, you can give a list of different content types or formats. Has there been any exploration

275
0:24:13.840 --> 0:24:20.160
into changing maybe the preferred format loaded to optimize for less power consumption as

276
0:24:20.160 --> 0:24:26.520
opposed to faster or higher resolution?

277
0:24:26.520 --> 0:24:30.920
So what I understood of the question is, has there been any exploration to changing the

278
0:24:30.920 --> 0:24:37.320
kind of content types we accept, for example, for images or media, to reduce power use?

279
0:24:37.320 --> 0:24:41.080
I think the answer is no. But I know there's currently exploration in terms of what we

280
0:24:41.080 --> 0:24:45.760
can do to reduce bandwidth use. And bandwidth also uses power in some ways. And we were

281
0:24:45.760 --> 0:24:51.160
thinking about this mostly in the case of estimating the cost of VPNs for users. And

282
0:24:51.160 --> 0:24:55.440
for users who really care about privacy and really want privacy on a VPN, could we do

283
0:24:55.440 --> 0:25:02.040
things to reduce the cost for them to pay for that VPN that charges for bandwidth?

284
0:25:02.040 --> 0:25:08.560
So I'm afraid that all the time we have, however, if you can see Florian put his email there

285
0:25:08.560 --> 0:25:13.600
for questions and also share it in the matrix room. And we also have that matrix room. Please

286
0:25:13.600 --> 0:25:18.960
also add questions there. And there will be member stuff there and also other volunteer

287
0:25:18.960 --> 0:25:25.440
resilient ones. Thank you very much. We need to change up for the next. Thank you very

288
0:25:25.440 --> 0:25:26.440
much, Florian.

289
0:25:26.440 --> 0:25:56.420
Sure.
