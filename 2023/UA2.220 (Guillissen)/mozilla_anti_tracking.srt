1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.920
One minute, please sit down everyone.

2
0:00:13.920 --> 0:00:17.320
I start.

3
0:00:17.320 --> 0:00:24.320
Whenever you are ready.

4
0:00:24.320 --> 0:00:25.320
Okay.

5
0:00:25.320 --> 0:00:26.320
Team, team.

6
0:00:26.320 --> 0:00:27.320
You started?

7
0:00:27.320 --> 0:00:30.120
So, hello, everyone.

8
0:00:30.120 --> 0:00:33.800
Welcome to our third call where we have Vincent.

9
0:00:33.800 --> 0:00:40.480
Vincent Turo is a UI engineer on Mozilla privacy and security products team working on tools

10
0:00:40.480 --> 0:00:42.960
like Firefox Relay and Firefox Monitor.

11
0:00:42.960 --> 0:00:49.080
He's going to talk about over a decade of anti-tracking work at Mozilla.

12
0:00:49.080 --> 0:00:50.240
Thank you, Francesca.

13
0:00:50.240 --> 0:00:53.720
That was actually the first sentence of my presentation just gone now.

14
0:00:53.720 --> 0:00:58.520
Yeah, so I work on the privacy and security products team.

15
0:00:58.520 --> 0:01:06.240
Yeah, and so I want to start this presentation with a bit of a personal anecdote.

16
0:01:06.240 --> 0:01:09.240
My open source journey started with the release of Firefox 1.0.

17
0:01:09.240 --> 0:01:13.000
It was my first interaction with open source software.

18
0:01:13.000 --> 0:01:17.600
Later started using Linux, started contributing.

19
0:01:17.600 --> 0:01:18.600
First with translations.

20
0:01:18.600 --> 0:01:20.920
Later I became a software engineer.

21
0:01:20.920 --> 0:01:25.640
But I only joined Mozilla as an employee about a year and a half ago.

22
0:01:25.640 --> 0:01:29.840
So for this presentation where I'm going to discuss a little over a decade of anti-tracking

23
0:01:29.840 --> 0:01:36.400
work at Mozilla, I'm going to be leaning a lot on the experience of my coworkers, specifically

24
0:01:36.400 --> 0:01:42.680
Luke Crouch and Max Crawford, other engineers on the privacy and security products team.

25
0:01:42.680 --> 0:01:43.680
They wrote this blog post.

26
0:01:43.680 --> 0:01:47.240
So most of the content of this presentation is also in the blog post.

27
0:01:47.240 --> 0:01:51.680
So if you want to have a quick high level recap, you can read that afterwards.

28
0:01:51.680 --> 0:01:54.240
It's also linked on the Fostom site, I think.

29
0:01:54.240 --> 0:01:57.120
But Luke has been at Mozilla for basically forever.

30
0:01:57.120 --> 0:01:59.480
Mozilla threw in through lots of institutional knowledge.

31
0:01:59.480 --> 0:02:03.000
So lots of the content is by him.

32
0:02:03.000 --> 0:02:04.160
Max did most of the illustrations.

33
0:02:04.160 --> 0:02:08.840
So that's where credit is due.

34
0:02:08.840 --> 0:02:12.000
So tracking, it can be beneficial.

35
0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:17.560
I want to do one short scary slide and then the rest will be more positive.

36
0:02:17.560 --> 0:02:24.600
But I want to take a bit of a moment to discuss the risk of tracking.

37
0:02:24.600 --> 0:02:30.640
Why are we actually trying to minimize the harmful effects of tracking?

38
0:02:30.640 --> 0:02:32.360
So tracking is a personal risk.

39
0:02:32.360 --> 0:02:35.640
You can fall victim to phishing attacks, for example.

40
0:02:35.640 --> 0:02:37.480
Or the people around you can fall victim to it.

41
0:02:37.480 --> 0:02:46.280
So if more of your data leaks, it can be used to impersonate you and get, for example, people

42
0:02:46.280 --> 0:02:49.680
around you to transfer large sums of money or whatever.

43
0:02:49.680 --> 0:02:54.440
So if someone contacts my father and says, hey, it's your son, could you please wire

44
0:02:54.440 --> 0:02:57.200
me 5,000 euros?

45
0:02:57.200 --> 0:03:00.840
It's a lot less believable than if they were to say, hey, it's Vincent.

46
0:03:00.840 --> 0:03:02.200
I just got fired from Mozilla.

47
0:03:02.200 --> 0:03:04.960
Hopefully, it never happens.

48
0:03:04.960 --> 0:03:08.280
Could you wire me 5,000 euros because I'm in money trouble or whatever?

49
0:03:08.280 --> 0:03:09.280
That's a lot more convincing.

50
0:03:09.280 --> 0:03:11.760
So data can be abused.

51
0:03:11.760 --> 0:03:14.600
But it's also a more societal risk.

52
0:03:14.600 --> 0:03:18.320
So ransomware has been in the news a lot recently.

53
0:03:18.320 --> 0:03:21.000
It costs a lot of money.

54
0:03:21.000 --> 0:03:26.400
It can even be used to convince people not to vote if they are aligned with a certain

55
0:03:26.400 --> 0:03:28.240
political party or et cetera.

56
0:03:28.240 --> 0:03:32.280
So there's risks involved with tracking.

57
0:03:32.280 --> 0:03:36.600
The rest of my presentation should be more positive.

58
0:03:36.600 --> 0:03:44.280
I'm going to discuss what we're doing to minimize those harmful effects to allow you to confidently

59
0:03:44.280 --> 0:03:46.880
use the internet carefree.

60
0:03:46.880 --> 0:03:48.960
So there's a variety of ways to track you.

61
0:03:48.960 --> 0:03:53.120
Historically, a lot of attention both inside of Mozilla and outside of Mozilla has been

62
0:03:53.120 --> 0:03:54.760
given to tracking cookies.

63
0:03:54.760 --> 0:04:00.000
So I'll start my presentation with an overview of what we've been doing there.

64
0:04:00.000 --> 0:04:03.800
And then I'll go over these other forms as well.

65
0:04:03.800 --> 0:04:09.560
So cookies and a bunch of related technologies that all call cookies.

66
0:04:09.560 --> 0:04:14.220
There are bits of data that websites can store on your computer, which can be useful.

67
0:04:14.220 --> 0:04:19.320
So if you load a website and the website sees a bit of data that proves that you are you,

68
0:04:19.320 --> 0:04:23.840
it can decide to give you your shopping card or your private messages or whatever and not

69
0:04:23.840 --> 0:04:24.840
show someone else's.

70
0:04:24.840 --> 0:04:27.640
So that's a good thing.

71
0:04:27.640 --> 0:04:30.640
That can also be used to track you if you don't want that.

72
0:04:30.640 --> 0:04:32.920
So every website you visit can set cookies.

73
0:04:32.920 --> 0:04:35.160
But not just that website.

74
0:04:35.160 --> 0:04:36.600
Websites can also embed other websites.

75
0:04:36.600 --> 0:04:41.560
So for example, a website could contain a YouTube video and then YouTube can set cookies

76
0:04:41.560 --> 0:04:42.560
as well.

77
0:04:42.560 --> 0:04:43.680
It can contain ads.

78
0:04:43.680 --> 0:04:49.040
And then those are often also served by a third party website can also set cookies.

79
0:04:49.040 --> 0:04:51.840
Websites can even embed other websites without just seeing them.

80
0:04:51.840 --> 0:04:55.420
So for example, with the goal of tracking you.

81
0:04:55.420 --> 0:04:58.060
So those can also set cookies.

82
0:04:58.060 --> 0:05:04.060
So we've been clamping down on that primarily through Firefox.

83
0:05:04.060 --> 0:05:10.920
So I'll start my overview with Firefox private browsing introduced in 2008 after a Chrome

84
0:05:10.920 --> 0:05:13.080
was released which had an incognito window.

85
0:05:13.080 --> 0:05:17.840
But a private browsing window is basically a window that as soon as you close it forgets

86
0:05:17.840 --> 0:05:21.320
everything you did in there, forgets the cookies that were stored as well.

87
0:05:21.320 --> 0:05:27.200
It's often jokingly referred to as porn mode but it's definitely also an anti-tracking

88
0:05:27.200 --> 0:05:28.200
tool.

89
0:05:28.200 --> 0:05:30.560
So for example, my girlfriend used it as such.

90
0:05:30.560 --> 0:05:37.320
She's a kind of ridiculous Harry Potter fan, like participates in international pub quizzes

91
0:05:37.320 --> 0:05:39.320
about Harry Potter level.

92
0:05:39.320 --> 0:05:41.760
But she's also a high school teacher.

93
0:05:41.760 --> 0:05:46.800
And so sometimes she'll need to show a video of something that happened in the news recently.

94
0:05:46.800 --> 0:05:52.080
And she'll go to YouTube, share her screen, and show a YouTube video to her class.

95
0:05:52.080 --> 0:05:56.560
And she doesn't necessarily want her entire private life, which is entirely Harry Potter,

96
0:05:56.560 --> 0:05:59.760
shown in the YouTube recommendations.

97
0:05:59.760 --> 0:06:06.920
So what she does is at home when she's listening to Harry Potter music or ASMR or podcast

98
0:06:06.920 --> 0:06:12.800
or whatever on YouTube, she'll open a private browsing window and do that thing in there.

99
0:06:12.800 --> 0:06:15.840
And then if she closes it, then YouTube can't correlate those two sessions.

100
0:06:15.840 --> 0:06:23.200
So won't show Harry Potter recommendations when she's sharing something with her class.

101
0:06:23.200 --> 0:06:26.240
Another reason why I'm starting my overview with this private browsing window is that

102
0:06:26.240 --> 0:06:31.160
it's we interpret if someone uses a private browsing window, we interpret that as a signal

103
0:06:31.160 --> 0:06:37.240
that someone wants less tracking and is willing to accept some more breakage.

104
0:06:37.240 --> 0:06:43.040
And so unfortunately often when we're trying to block tracking, websites assume that they

105
0:06:43.040 --> 0:06:45.080
can track you and then build their functionality on that.

106
0:06:45.080 --> 0:06:48.680
So there's a risk if you combat that, that you break the website.

107
0:06:48.680 --> 0:06:53.400
So whenever we want to introduce new measures to combat tracking, we'll first introduce

108
0:06:53.400 --> 0:06:58.640
it in private browsing, see how much it breaks there, and then later we can try to port it

109
0:06:58.640 --> 0:07:02.080
over to your regular browsing window.

110
0:07:02.080 --> 0:07:06.000
So that's why I mentioned private browsing first.

111
0:07:06.000 --> 0:07:10.560
In 2013, we introduced more granular cookie control.

112
0:07:10.560 --> 0:07:13.280
So you could make that trade-off yourself as a user.

113
0:07:13.280 --> 0:07:16.720
You could choose, for example, to not use cookies at all.

114
0:07:16.720 --> 0:07:17.720
Lots of breakage.

115
0:07:17.720 --> 0:07:23.040
You wouldn't even be able to log into websites anymore, but also remove that tracking factor.

116
0:07:23.040 --> 0:07:27.160
You could also choose to, for example, not the third-party cookie.

117
0:07:27.160 --> 0:07:30.640
So if you visit a website, then that YouTube video that's in there might not be able to

118
0:07:30.640 --> 0:07:31.760
set cookies.

119
0:07:31.760 --> 0:07:33.120
Less breakage, but still quite a bit.

120
0:07:33.120 --> 0:07:40.480
So it gave you that control, which is helpful, but it's also kind of out of the way.

121
0:07:40.480 --> 0:07:41.760
You have to know of these options.

122
0:07:41.760 --> 0:07:46.120
You have to understand what they do, understand their risks, and just making that trade-off

123
0:07:46.120 --> 0:07:50.760
between breakage and less tracking isn't a great one in the first place.

124
0:07:50.760 --> 0:07:56.240
So later on, we also introduced a block list so that basically a list of cookies that we

125
0:07:56.240 --> 0:07:58.080
know are just used to track you.

126
0:07:58.080 --> 0:08:01.040
Don't provide any functionality for you as a user.

127
0:08:01.040 --> 0:08:03.040
And we allowed you to block those cookies.

128
0:08:03.040 --> 0:08:09.180
So less breakage doesn't prevent all tracking, but helps there.

129
0:08:09.180 --> 0:08:15.800
And then not too long ago, 2021, that's really state-of-the-art anti-tracking cookie work.

130
0:08:15.800 --> 0:08:18.760
We introduced what we call total cookie protection.

131
0:08:18.760 --> 0:08:21.320
So that doesn't actually block cookies.

132
0:08:21.320 --> 0:08:25.380
But for example, if you visit youtube.com and then later visit a different website that

133
0:08:25.380 --> 0:08:29.700
also includes a YouTube video, they'll both have cookies, but they'll be different cookie

134
0:08:29.700 --> 0:08:30.700
jars.

135
0:08:30.700 --> 0:08:33.680
So YouTube will still not be able to correlate those two sessions.

136
0:08:33.680 --> 0:08:38.040
So that helps prevent that tracking factor without actually breaking it, because from

137
0:08:38.040 --> 0:08:39.880
YouTube's point of view, they still have cookies.

138
0:08:39.880 --> 0:08:42.440
So that's the work so far.

139
0:08:42.440 --> 0:08:44.360
Obviously the timeline here stops at 2021.

140
0:08:44.360 --> 0:08:48.300
We're in 2023 now, but they're still the future.

141
0:08:48.300 --> 0:08:51.840
So we're always working on more things to combat that.

142
0:08:51.840 --> 0:08:55.800
But that's my overview of cookies so far.

143
0:08:55.800 --> 0:08:58.420
With that, let's move on to IP addresses.

144
0:08:58.420 --> 0:09:04.040
So IP addresses are basically addresses for every device that's connected to the internet.

145
0:09:04.040 --> 0:09:05.560
They're relatively stable.

146
0:09:05.560 --> 0:09:12.960
They can change, but most of the time, most devices have the same address.

147
0:09:12.960 --> 0:09:15.480
And this is a pretty strong identifier.

148
0:09:15.480 --> 0:09:17.640
Like for example, I'm the only one that uses this phone.

149
0:09:17.640 --> 0:09:19.560
It often has the same IP address.

150
0:09:19.560 --> 0:09:24.440
So everything you can link to that IP address is quite sure to be me.

151
0:09:24.440 --> 0:09:28.880
Same goes for this laptop, for example.

152
0:09:28.880 --> 0:09:35.520
And they're not just tools to link you, but they're also often correlated to the same

153
0:09:35.520 --> 0:09:37.760
to your geographical location.

154
0:09:37.760 --> 0:09:42.840
So it's not super specific, but when I'm at home, you can deduce from my IP address which

155
0:09:42.840 --> 0:09:44.280
city I am.

156
0:09:44.280 --> 0:09:45.280
I'm in.

157
0:09:45.280 --> 0:09:49.200
So yeah, that's the risk of IP addresses.

158
0:09:49.200 --> 0:09:51.320
So whatever we've been doing there.

159
0:09:51.320 --> 0:09:54.200
Well, like cookies, oh, I forgot this.

160
0:09:54.200 --> 0:10:01.400
So the thing with IP addresses, it's inherently if two devices connect to each other via the

161
0:10:01.400 --> 0:10:05.600
internet, they can see each other's IP addresses.

162
0:10:05.600 --> 0:10:09.200
And so that means by virtue of connecting to a website, that website will be able to

163
0:10:09.200 --> 0:10:11.480
see your IP address.

164
0:10:11.480 --> 0:10:13.840
And again, websites can embed other websites.

165
0:10:13.840 --> 0:10:17.840
So those embedded websites can also see your IP address.

166
0:10:17.840 --> 0:10:24.760
So just like we did for cookie protection, we introduced a block list of IP addresses

167
0:10:24.760 --> 0:10:29.120
that are known to track you and not provide other functionality.

168
0:10:29.120 --> 0:10:33.400
As I mentioned, first in private browsing later also gave you that option in your regular

169
0:10:33.400 --> 0:10:36.640
browser window, browsing, which is good.

170
0:10:36.640 --> 0:10:41.120
If you never even connect to a tracking server or to an answer or whatever, it can't track

171
0:10:41.120 --> 0:10:42.120
you.

172
0:10:42.120 --> 0:10:43.120
It can't see your IP address.

173
0:10:43.120 --> 0:10:48.080
But obviously, we can only do this for connections that don't provide any functionality.

174
0:10:48.080 --> 0:10:52.680
We can't start blocking youtube.com because you won't be able to visit to view that video

175
0:10:52.680 --> 0:10:54.120
anymore.

176
0:10:54.120 --> 0:11:02.360
So to battle that, in 2019, we introduced Firefox private network, which is in between

177
0:11:02.360 --> 0:11:07.000
your browser and the website you're connecting to.

178
0:11:07.000 --> 0:11:11.200
And so instead of connecting directly to that website, you'll connect to Firefox private

179
0:11:11.200 --> 0:11:17.920
network and then Firefox private network connects to the website you're trying to view.

180
0:11:17.920 --> 0:11:22.520
And then from the point of view of that website, it will see the IP address of Firefox private

181
0:11:22.520 --> 0:11:23.520
network.

182
0:11:23.520 --> 0:11:28.560
So in 2020, we expanded that to your entire device with Mozilla VPN, which protects not

183
0:11:28.560 --> 0:11:32.240
just your browser traffic, but everything on your device.

184
0:11:32.240 --> 0:11:34.720
And you can also use it on multiple devices.

185
0:11:34.720 --> 0:11:39.840
Yeah, so that's our IP protection so far.

186
0:11:39.840 --> 0:11:46.080
Yeah, then I'll move on to email addresses, which is the fun part because I worked specifically

187
0:11:46.080 --> 0:11:51.280
on Firefox relay product here that I'll discuss in a second.

188
0:11:51.280 --> 0:11:58.160
The first is a question that blew my mind when Luke first mentioned it.

189
0:11:58.160 --> 0:12:04.680
But email addresses, they feel like you can easily create a new email address, right?

190
0:12:04.680 --> 0:12:08.440
You go to g1.com, enter a username and a password, and you've got a new email address.

191
0:12:08.440 --> 0:12:09.920
So they feel like they're easy to change.

192
0:12:09.920 --> 0:12:13.880
But in practice, you've probably changed your house address more often than you've changed

193
0:12:13.880 --> 0:12:15.360
your email address.

194
0:12:15.360 --> 0:12:21.480
I've moved a lot, like, I don't know, six times in the past 10 years maybe, but all

195
0:12:21.480 --> 0:12:24.120
the time I've been reachable via the same email address.

196
0:12:24.120 --> 0:12:29.560
So if you have that on file, there's so much history about me that you know via that email

197
0:12:29.560 --> 0:12:30.760
address.

198
0:12:30.760 --> 0:12:33.040
So it's a pretty stable identifier.

199
0:12:33.040 --> 0:12:38.400
And it's cool if you block all your third-party tracking cookies and you hide your IP address,

200
0:12:38.400 --> 0:12:43.480
but if you then go on and sign in with your email address, they can just correlate that

201
0:12:43.480 --> 0:12:45.480
back together.

202
0:12:45.480 --> 0:12:51.000
And this happens, for example, if you go to an online store and you buy clothes or whatever

203
0:12:51.000 --> 0:12:55.240
and you sign in with your email address and then have the clothes delivered from the point

204
0:12:55.240 --> 0:12:58.640
of view from that store, you're a very attractive customer.

205
0:12:58.640 --> 0:13:02.880
Like, compared to some random on the street, you're far more likely to make another purchase

206
0:13:02.880 --> 0:13:05.300
there than some random person is, right?

207
0:13:05.300 --> 0:13:10.440
So what that store then does is they go to Instagram or whatever, and they're like, hey,

208
0:13:10.440 --> 0:13:12.240
here's an advertising campaign.

209
0:13:12.240 --> 0:13:16.440
There's also a list of all the email addresses of our customers.

210
0:13:16.440 --> 0:13:21.040
Could you please show those ads to those customers?

211
0:13:21.040 --> 0:13:23.680
And so from the point of view of that store, that's great news.

212
0:13:23.680 --> 0:13:25.440
They can advertise to you.

213
0:13:25.440 --> 0:13:26.760
You're a high-potential customer.

214
0:13:26.760 --> 0:13:33.520
But from the point of view of Instagram or Facebook, Meta, whatever, owns it, it's even

215
0:13:33.520 --> 0:13:37.560
better because they have not just your activity on Instagram and Facebook and WhatsApp, et

216
0:13:37.560 --> 0:13:38.560
cetera.

217
0:13:38.560 --> 0:13:43.920
They go, hey, you're a customer of that store and of any other stores that have done the

218
0:13:43.920 --> 0:13:44.920
same.

219
0:13:44.920 --> 0:13:49.920
So lots of ways to track you, and that's the voluntary part, voluntary data sharing by

220
0:13:49.920 --> 0:13:52.940
third parties.

221
0:13:52.940 --> 0:14:00.160
But in 2018, I believe, we introduced Firefox Monitor, which basically it keeps track of

222
0:14:00.160 --> 0:14:02.720
data leaks that happen.

223
0:14:02.720 --> 0:14:07.080
And if you sign up for Firefox Monitor, it will warn you if your data was found in a

224
0:14:07.080 --> 0:14:11.480
data leak, if there was a hack or whatever, to remind you, hey, maybe you want to change

225
0:14:11.480 --> 0:14:12.480
your password.

226
0:14:12.480 --> 0:14:18.280
But what we saw is that many people use the same email address at different services.

227
0:14:18.280 --> 0:14:23.600
So if there's data leaks in different services with the same email address, you can link

228
0:14:23.600 --> 0:14:26.720
the two data leaks, the data in the two data leaks.

229
0:14:26.720 --> 0:14:30.240
You can link them together and know that they're about the same person.

230
0:14:30.240 --> 0:14:35.640
And many people even, probably not all of you, but other people also use the same password

231
0:14:35.640 --> 0:14:37.080
across different websites.

232
0:14:37.080 --> 0:14:41.360
So even if there's not a data leak in a different website, by using your email address and your

233
0:14:41.360 --> 0:14:46.600
password, they're still able to extract data from those other websites.

234
0:14:46.600 --> 0:14:48.080
So that's obviously not great.

235
0:14:48.080 --> 0:14:52.520
So in 2020, we introduced Firefox Relay.

236
0:14:52.520 --> 0:14:56.080
And what basically Firefox Relay does is it provides you with a unique email address per

237
0:14:56.080 --> 0:14:57.080
service.

238
0:14:57.080 --> 0:14:59.760
So if you have a sign up form, you need to leave your email address.

239
0:14:59.760 --> 0:15:03.200
You hit the Relay button, and it will generate a new email address.

240
0:15:03.200 --> 0:15:10.280
So I know ZQF40 at multmail.com, for example.

241
0:15:10.280 --> 0:15:14.900
And it will forward all email that goes to that email address to your true email address.

242
0:15:14.900 --> 0:15:19.600
So the store will still be able to communicate with you, send you emails at that address,

243
0:15:19.600 --> 0:15:22.080
but that won't have your actual email address on file.

244
0:15:22.080 --> 0:15:26.800
And so if there's a data leak there, your data can be linked to your data elsewhere,

245
0:15:26.800 --> 0:15:30.680
because you have two different email addresses there.

246
0:15:30.680 --> 0:15:33.360
So that's Firefox Relay.

247
0:15:33.360 --> 0:15:34.360
Yeah.

248
0:15:34.360 --> 0:15:38.600
Oh, actually, I'm doing well on time.

249
0:15:38.600 --> 0:15:41.440
You're welcome, Francesca.

250
0:15:41.440 --> 0:15:43.880
So then I lost the phone numbers.

251
0:15:43.880 --> 0:15:45.760
So kind of similar threat, right?

252
0:15:45.760 --> 0:15:49.640
It was super annoying when I started to use Relay, and cool, you can leave your email

253
0:15:49.640 --> 0:15:50.640
address.

254
0:15:50.640 --> 0:15:52.440
And I'm like, ha ha ha, I've got my Firefox Relay address.

255
0:15:52.440 --> 0:15:53.440
You can catch me.

256
0:15:53.440 --> 0:15:56.520
And then they're like, can you give your phone number two?

257
0:15:56.520 --> 0:15:59.140
A bit of a shame.

258
0:15:59.140 --> 0:16:06.420
So what we did is late last year, we introduced phone masking for Firefox Relay, added this

259
0:16:06.420 --> 0:16:07.800
graphic to our website.

260
0:16:07.800 --> 0:16:11.080
But it works similar to email masking.

261
0:16:11.080 --> 0:16:17.440
You get a phone number mask, so a new phone number, and all the text messages, all the

262
0:16:17.440 --> 0:16:21.400
phone calls that go to that phone number will be forwarded to your true number without having

263
0:16:21.400 --> 0:16:24.680
to share your true phone number.

264
0:16:24.680 --> 0:16:29.320
And so if you get, for example, a text message saying, hey, it's your bank.

265
0:16:29.320 --> 0:16:35.160
Could you please change your password, go to this website and change it?

266
0:16:35.160 --> 0:16:37.880
That's an additional signal where you can see, well, this is not actually my true phone

267
0:16:37.880 --> 0:16:39.160
number, which my bank has.

268
0:16:39.160 --> 0:16:43.080
So this is probably a scammer.

269
0:16:43.080 --> 0:16:45.000
This is a pretty new edition.

270
0:16:45.000 --> 0:16:48.960
So unfortunately for probably most of you, also for myself, especially given that I work

271
0:16:48.960 --> 0:16:56.440
on it, not available outside the US and Canada yet, but hopefully soon.

272
0:16:56.440 --> 0:17:03.240
But yeah, so the point there is lots of this work is like the broadening of the scope beyond

273
0:17:03.240 --> 0:17:05.920
just tracking cookies.

274
0:17:05.920 --> 0:17:07.920
That's all quite recent works.

275
0:17:07.920 --> 0:17:12.720
You should saw like 2018 onwards, we started to broaden our focus.

276
0:17:12.720 --> 0:17:18.780
That's also when the security and privacy products team around then started.

277
0:17:18.780 --> 0:17:21.120
So yeah, we're not done yet.

278
0:17:21.120 --> 0:17:26.680
Obviously this is the overview of the timeline so far.

279
0:17:26.680 --> 0:17:33.080
And yeah, if you have any ideas of what we can do, do leave them on Mozilla Connect.

280
0:17:33.080 --> 0:17:35.640
And that's, I think everything I had.

281
0:17:35.640 --> 0:17:47.120
Damn, my practice was so much slower.

282
0:17:47.120 --> 0:17:48.920
Thank you very much.

283
0:17:48.920 --> 0:17:51.880
And so does anyone have any questions?

284
0:17:51.880 --> 0:18:07.640
So especially with the IP and email protection, it really seems like you have a single part

285
0:18:07.640 --> 0:18:08.640
of the page.

286
0:18:08.640 --> 0:18:09.640
What do you do to mitigate any risks?

287
0:18:09.640 --> 0:18:11.040
So the question was if, that's what you, yeah.

288
0:18:11.040 --> 0:18:17.120
So the question is if, especially for Mozilla VPN and Firefox Relay, Mozilla is kind of

289
0:18:17.120 --> 0:18:19.920
the single point of failure there.

290
0:18:19.920 --> 0:18:25.960
And yeah, that's true.

291
0:18:25.960 --> 0:18:33.680
So the point of failure here is, for example, for Firefox Relay, if you're, imagine we're

292
0:18:33.680 --> 0:18:38.820
doing everything to prevent it, but imagine there's a data leak at Firefox Relay.

293
0:18:38.820 --> 0:18:47.560
What then happens is your email address still gets public, which is annoying, obviously.

294
0:18:47.560 --> 0:18:49.760
But you're basically back at where you were before, right?

295
0:18:49.760 --> 0:18:54.840
But there's just one place where it could fill IE Firefox Relay rather than all those

296
0:18:54.840 --> 0:18:57.000
places that store your other email address.

297
0:18:57.000 --> 0:18:59.600
So yeah, it's annoying.

298
0:18:59.600 --> 0:19:04.880
Ideally we'd have, I'm not sure, I'm sure Luke has probably a couple of ideas around

299
0:19:04.880 --> 0:19:07.920
minimizing that that we might look at at some point.

300
0:19:07.920 --> 0:19:10.240
If you have, looks like you have an idea.

301
0:19:10.240 --> 0:19:16.520
Because especially if you are like the central place where you store everything, you become

302
0:19:16.520 --> 0:19:18.480
a very attractive target.

303
0:19:18.480 --> 0:19:19.480
Yeah that's true.

304
0:19:19.480 --> 0:19:24.840
So yeah, if the, we're saying if we're a central place that has, have lots of email

305
0:19:24.840 --> 0:19:28.120
address, obviously we become a bigger target.

306
0:19:28.120 --> 0:19:29.120
That is true.

307
0:19:29.120 --> 0:19:34.720
I wouldn't say like right now Firefox Relay and VPN as well aren't that big compared

308
0:19:34.720 --> 0:19:38.480
to like there's far bigger data, data faults.

309
0:19:38.480 --> 0:19:45.000
But that's definitely something we're aware of and want to minimize.

310
0:19:45.000 --> 0:19:55.120
I think right now for, at least for me personally the, for me personally that is still worth

311
0:19:55.120 --> 0:19:56.120
it, right?

312
0:19:56.120 --> 0:20:00.360
The risk is smaller for using Firefox Relay.

313
0:20:00.360 --> 0:20:08.000
For, if I want to order a ticket for example, like a concert ticket, I'll give them a Relay

314
0:20:08.000 --> 0:20:13.240
address, they'll forward me the ticket and I'm done with it and I never knew that again.

315
0:20:13.240 --> 0:20:17.560
For your, if you're interacting with your bank for example, I would use your actual

316
0:20:17.560 --> 0:20:19.440
email address.

317
0:20:19.440 --> 0:20:24.160
So it's, yeah, there's definitely a risk calculation to make there.

318
0:20:24.160 --> 0:20:27.600
Nothing is a, yeah, all these products are not a perfect solution.

319
0:20:27.600 --> 0:20:32.920
I think that's basically the threat in all of this.

320
0:20:32.920 --> 0:20:39.800
It's all about trying to find that balance, like with the trying to block cookies for

321
0:20:39.800 --> 0:20:43.640
example, it's all trying to find this balance between how much tracking do we want to allow

322
0:20:43.640 --> 0:20:46.280
and how much breakage do we want to allow.

323
0:20:46.280 --> 0:20:51.240
There's always tracking that we can't prevent and there's always downsides of our anti-tracking

324
0:20:51.240 --> 0:20:52.360
measures that we can't prevent.

325
0:20:52.360 --> 0:20:57.360
So yeah, I wish I had a better answer but that's it.

326
0:20:57.360 --> 0:20:59.800
We have a personal sign matrix.

327
0:20:59.800 --> 0:21:00.800
Okay.

328
0:21:00.800 --> 0:21:04.920
It currently doesn't work with short.

329
0:21:04.920 --> 0:21:06.920
Ah, okay.

330
0:21:06.920 --> 0:21:16.120
So Danny on our matrix is asking that I'm not, yeah, so is asking about Firefox Relay

331
0:21:16.120 --> 0:21:21.120
phone number masks, not working with a bunch of tools.

332
0:21:21.120 --> 0:21:27.240
That is something we're aware of and working to fix for those who are familiar with phone

333
0:21:27.240 --> 0:21:28.240
number masking.

334
0:21:28.240 --> 0:21:29.240
Yeah.

335
0:21:29.240 --> 0:21:39.240
So my question is, is it correct to state that at the moment none of the services we

336
0:21:39.240 --> 0:21:44.240
demonstrate actually treat our data end to end and then end to end encryption so that

337
0:21:44.240 --> 0:21:48.240
you can't see our data and follow up question to this question, if you have any plans to

338
0:21:48.240 --> 0:21:53.680
implement end to end detection, is it even realistic in this space?

339
0:21:53.680 --> 0:22:04.520
So the question is, do we end to end and create the data we're handling?

340
0:22:04.520 --> 0:22:08.680
Obviously not applicable to everything like cookie, et cetera, not.

341
0:22:08.680 --> 0:22:15.880
For emails, that's basically not possible because we need to know your email address

342
0:22:15.880 --> 0:22:17.920
to actually be able to forward email.

343
0:22:17.920 --> 0:22:22.560
We don't store the emails we forward so we get them for them to you and forget about

344
0:22:22.560 --> 0:22:23.560
them.

345
0:22:23.560 --> 0:22:26.560
So, um, damn it.

346
0:22:26.560 --> 0:22:32.320
Uh, VPN, actually I'm not sure maybe, but I see why you are here.

347
0:22:32.320 --> 0:22:33.320
Is that encrypted?

348
0:22:33.320 --> 0:22:37.600
I think your connection via VPN is encrypted, right?

349
0:22:37.600 --> 0:22:43.440
So yeah, um, VPN works the way that you generate like this.

350
0:22:43.440 --> 0:22:45.440
We're using one.

351
0:22:45.440 --> 0:22:48.160
Sorry for putting you on the spot, but.

352
0:22:48.160 --> 0:22:49.160
Hi.

353
0:22:49.160 --> 0:22:50.160
Um, yeah.

354
0:22:50.160 --> 0:22:52.240
So VPN works, um, we're using the Wagga protocol.

355
0:22:52.240 --> 0:22:56.560
So on the client, you generate your own private key and you only upload the public key to

356
0:22:56.560 --> 0:22:59.160
the mother, the mother VPN network.

357
0:22:59.160 --> 0:23:02.640
And then during the server handshake with a partner, you generate a session key.

358
0:23:02.640 --> 0:23:06.880
So essentially even if your public key gets leaked, we can't see anything.

359
0:23:06.880 --> 0:23:07.880
Yeah.

360
0:23:07.880 --> 0:23:09.960
So VPN is, is entered and encrypted.

361
0:23:09.960 --> 0:23:15.880
We can't see your, uh, what, what you pass through there.

362
0:23:15.880 --> 0:23:16.880
Hey.

363
0:23:16.880 --> 0:23:17.880
Hi.

364
0:23:17.880 --> 0:23:24.680
Uh, I wonder how does a Firefox relay, um, like, uh, prevent spam?

365
0:23:24.680 --> 0:23:28.640
Like how does, what kind of like mechanism does it use to catch?

366
0:23:28.640 --> 0:23:32.080
Uh, so there's a basic spam filter.

367
0:23:32.080 --> 0:23:40.360
Um, we make sure that if, uh, so if we forward our email and your email and you mark market

368
0:23:40.360 --> 0:23:46.680
as spam in your, uh, in your inbox, Firefox relay gets a signal and stop forwarding emails

369
0:23:46.680 --> 0:23:51.560
to that email address because, uh, you know, it's spam.

370
0:23:51.560 --> 0:23:57.080
I wouldn't know.

371
0:23:57.080 --> 0:24:03.920
So the question was what service do we use to, to detect spam, um, come to our matrix

372
0:24:03.920 --> 0:24:05.600
and I'll find out for you.

373
0:24:05.600 --> 0:24:06.600
Uh, yeah.

374
0:24:06.600 --> 0:24:07.600
All right.

375
0:24:07.600 --> 0:24:09.200
I reckon engineers will know that.

376
0:24:09.200 --> 0:24:10.200
Yeah.

377
0:24:10.200 --> 0:24:11.920
I'm not involved with that part of the implementation.

378
0:24:11.920 --> 0:24:16.040
Um, but we do have a number of anti-spam and anti abuse mechanisms in there.

379
0:24:16.040 --> 0:24:19.840
Um, cause obviously we don't want to get blocked by other people as well.

380
0:24:19.840 --> 0:24:21.840
Uh, thank you for the talk.

381
0:24:21.840 --> 0:24:24.160
Uh, might sound like a stupid question.

382
0:24:24.160 --> 0:24:29.040
You mentioned the three or four products like relay VPN and monitor.

383
0:24:29.040 --> 0:24:31.240
Are they free, including the VPN?

384
0:24:31.240 --> 0:24:32.240
Uh, no.

385
0:24:32.240 --> 0:24:33.240
So the VPN is paid.

386
0:24:33.240 --> 0:24:35.680
I would also recommend you not to use a free VPN.

387
0:24:35.680 --> 0:24:37.040
They're almost all shady.

388
0:24:37.040 --> 0:24:40.880
Uh, quite a few of the paid ones are also pretty shady actually.

389
0:24:40.880 --> 0:24:42.280
Um, but no.

390
0:24:42.280 --> 0:24:48.960
So the VPN is, I believe if you pay annually, I think five euros a month.

391
0:24:48.960 --> 0:24:50.700
Uh, I see not.

392
0:24:50.700 --> 0:24:51.700
So that's good.

393
0:24:51.700 --> 0:24:56.680
Uh, Firefox relay has a free plan which gives you just five email addresses.

394
0:24:56.680 --> 0:24:59.160
Uh, so that works with them.

395
0:24:59.160 --> 0:25:01.880
If you want to give every service a unique email address, that's not great.

396
0:25:01.880 --> 0:25:04.720
Um, but they cost one euro a month.

397
0:25:04.720 --> 0:25:08.680
Um, and, um, monitor is free.

398
0:25:08.680 --> 0:25:10.520
Uh, yeah.

399
0:25:10.520 --> 0:25:17.760
And so part of this is also like part of what we're doing at Mozilla is, is, you know, building

400
0:25:17.760 --> 0:25:20.040
these, these, uh, privacy protecting tools.

401
0:25:20.040 --> 0:25:23.360
Uh, we're also trying to find ways to have those finance themselves.

402
0:25:23.360 --> 0:25:28.880
So that's what, yeah, it's not, um, yeah, we're not trying to sell ads or anything.

403
0:25:28.880 --> 0:25:29.880
You pay for it.

404
0:25:29.880 --> 0:25:30.880
You're the customer.

405
0:25:30.880 --> 0:25:32.600
That's, that's the idea there.

406
0:25:32.600 --> 0:25:34.560
All right.

407
0:25:34.560 --> 0:25:39.480
So I think it's pretty obvious that the technologies that are being used to track is now kind

408
0:25:39.480 --> 0:25:43.640
of almost requires to have a sort of centralized entity to sort of resolve it.

409
0:25:43.640 --> 0:25:48.760
Whereas cookie protection could be kind of done decentralized and that obviously makes

410
0:25:48.760 --> 0:25:53.280
Mozilla as a, as an organization, a kind of a target of critique, I guess, because you

411
0:25:53.280 --> 0:25:56.080
become centralized to some sort of tracking.

412
0:25:56.080 --> 0:26:01.600
Is there some sort of track or something that happens at Mozilla to mitigate the risks of

413
0:26:01.600 --> 0:26:04.880
being a single entity that could store too much information?

414
0:26:04.880 --> 0:26:10.320
Like for instance, in terms of relays, there is separate entity that, or, or an entrenched

415
0:26:10.320 --> 0:26:14.640
thing that tries to ensure that you don't store too much data so that at least you can't

416
0:26:14.640 --> 0:26:17.120
kind of try to monetize it yourself.

417
0:26:17.120 --> 0:26:22.360
Um, they, yeah, everyone can hear it.

418
0:26:22.360 --> 0:26:23.360
Right.

419
0:26:23.360 --> 0:26:28.600
So, um, one, one strategy there that we have as a Mozilla, we have our lean data practices.

420
0:26:28.600 --> 0:26:32.000
So that means collect as little, as little data as possible.

421
0:26:32.000 --> 0:26:33.440
That's one way to mitigate that.

422
0:26:33.440 --> 0:26:37.440
So for example, in Firefox Relay, it's why we only store your email address.

423
0:26:37.440 --> 0:26:41.040
We don't store the emails we forward.

424
0:26:41.040 --> 0:26:46.400
You can choose, so you can choose to store, uh, associations like which lay, which mass

425
0:26:46.400 --> 0:26:49.920
data use of which website, but you can also choose to have that stored locally if you

426
0:26:49.920 --> 0:26:53.480
have the extension or just not stored at all.

427
0:26:53.480 --> 0:27:00.880
Um, and yeah, in terms of, we'd like, like, it's definitely something we'd like.

428
0:27:00.880 --> 0:27:04.520
I don't, I'm not sure of initiatives going on there.

429
0:27:04.520 --> 0:27:13.880
Um, and we do, um, not last night train of thought, but, um, yeah.

430
0:27:13.880 --> 0:27:14.880
Thank you very much.

431
0:27:14.880 --> 0:27:17.360
Unfortunately, this last question we have time off.

432
0:27:17.360 --> 0:27:21.600
Please put the rest in the matrix room.

433
0:27:21.600 --> 0:27:42.300
Okay, I'll leave, uh, go ahead and as I

434
0:27:42.300 --> 0:27:52.300
I think I like 100% my fingers for this team.

435
0:27:52.300 --> 0:27:53.300
Like 100%.

436
0:27:53.300 --> 0:27:54.300
Yeah.

437
0:27:54.300 --> 0:27:55.300
Oh, cool.

438
0:27:55.300 --> 0:28:00.300
It's like fresh air, like you've got everything.

439
0:28:00.300 --> 0:28:03.300
You can come on and make sure you're not wasting anything.

440
0:28:03.300 --> 0:28:05.300
Thank you.

441
0:28:05.300 --> 0:28:06.300
Thank you.

442
0:28:06.300 --> 0:28:08.300
No, no.

443
0:28:08.300 --> 0:28:13.300
And then obviously you're live.

444
0:28:13.300 --> 0:28:14.300
Yes.

445
0:28:14.300 --> 0:28:17.300
Yes.

446
0:28:17.300 --> 0:28:22.300
You have an adapter.

447
0:28:22.300 --> 0:28:40.300
Thank you.

448
0:28:40.300 --> 0:28:43.300
Wonderful.

449
0:28:43.300 --> 0:29:10.300
Thank you.

450
0:29:10.300 --> 0:29:14.300
I think most of you are going to turn on your second screen.

451
0:29:14.300 --> 0:29:16.300
It's not on, I think.

452
0:29:16.300 --> 0:29:19.300
It's on.

453
0:29:19.300 --> 0:29:21.300
It's difficult.

454
0:29:21.300 --> 0:29:24.300
So why doesn't that see it?

455
0:29:24.300 --> 0:29:27.300
I think what people are asking about is the current voting party.

456
0:29:27.300 --> 0:29:31.300
What does that do in the voting party?

457
0:29:31.300 --> 0:29:36.300
So in countries where, for example, ISPs are net worth,

458
0:29:36.300 --> 0:29:41.300
and they're not worth.

459
0:29:41.300 --> 0:29:44.300
They're not worth.

460
0:29:44.300 --> 0:29:47.300
I think it would be very secure.

461
0:29:47.300 --> 0:29:52.300
I get the title more.

462
0:29:52.300 --> 0:29:55.300
It's a different department.

463
0:29:55.300 --> 0:29:58.300
I'm sorry, I can't talk, but it depends if you just scatter over there.

464
0:29:58.300 --> 0:30:02.300
There's a better poll.

465
0:30:02.300 --> 0:30:03.300
Yes.

466
0:30:03.300 --> 0:30:04.300
It's coming.

467
0:30:04.300 --> 0:30:09.300
Yes.
