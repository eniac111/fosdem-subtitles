1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:13.440
So now we have two presenters, Benjamin DeKosny and Morgan Reschenberger.

2
0:00:13.440 --> 0:00:20.960
So Benjamin is a member of the Modilla Performance Engineering team and Morgan is a senior software

3
0:00:20.960 --> 0:00:25.920
engineer working on platform accessibility and Morgan if you want to repeat your name

4
0:00:25.920 --> 0:00:30.400
probably the right pronunciation. No you got it, Morgan Reschenberger that's me.

5
0:00:32.560 --> 0:00:35.920
Yeah we're going to talk to you about an accessibility project called

6
0:00:35.920 --> 0:00:40.240
Cache the World and the way that we're monitoring and measuring performance.

7
0:00:43.840 --> 0:00:50.240
So I'm Benjamin, I am on the performance team and I'm going to be talking about

8
0:00:50.240 --> 0:00:56.080
the collaboration from the performance side. And I'm Morgan, I'm on the accessibility team.

9
0:00:56.080 --> 0:01:00.480
I'm going to talk about the accessibility side. We put the matrix rooms for both of our teams here

10
0:01:00.480 --> 0:01:03.840
so if you have topic related questions after this you can follow up there.

11
0:01:06.720 --> 0:01:10.720
So here's the agenda, we're going to just talk a little bit about accessibility in

12
0:01:11.680 --> 0:01:17.920
Firefox. Morgan's going to go through intro to the rendering and accessibility architecture

13
0:01:17.920 --> 0:01:24.000
and some of the changes that happened with Cache the World. I'm going to talk a little bit about

14
0:01:24.000 --> 0:01:29.440
how we're measuring performance and some of those questions and current problems. We're going to go

15
0:01:29.440 --> 0:01:34.480
through our future work plans and then we're going to open it up for questions.

16
0:01:37.040 --> 0:01:44.480
So the first thing is scoping context for accessibility in Firefox. The goal is of

17
0:01:44.480 --> 0:01:51.200
course a faster accessibility engine and more performant web use for users, all users and

18
0:01:51.200 --> 0:01:56.400
especially users using accessible technologies. We also want to try to create a performance

19
0:01:56.960 --> 0:02:04.720
testing infrastructure that will be able to prove these things and test the more we change

20
0:02:04.720 --> 0:02:10.640
our internal infrastructures, we want to be able to make sure that we can catch problems.

21
0:02:10.640 --> 0:02:18.320
We also wanted to establish some accessibility metrics and we want to work in public with

22
0:02:18.320 --> 0:02:24.480
public dashboards that show the kind of performance that we're getting. We want to

23
0:02:26.720 --> 0:02:35.440
improve our documentation, we want to improve the debug experience and as such we're going to talk

24
0:02:35.440 --> 0:02:40.320
a little bit later about the profile markers that Nazeem talked about earlier but specifically the

25
0:02:40.320 --> 0:02:45.520
accessibility ones and we want to set up an infrastructure for collaboration.

26
0:02:48.480 --> 0:02:53.920
So scope on this is we're going to be talking about screen readers pretty much only and we're

27
0:02:53.920 --> 0:02:57.680
not going to be talking about any of these other accessibility technologies like screen

28
0:02:57.680 --> 0:03:02.720
magnification, contrast modes, on-screen keyboards, subtitles, any of that, that's all

29
0:03:02.720 --> 0:03:11.680
deferred until later in this work. So context for Firefox and accessible technologies is not great

30
0:03:11.680 --> 0:03:17.840
from the free software perspective, like almost all our users are on Windows and then you have

31
0:03:17.840 --> 0:03:26.480
a very small sliver of Mac and Linux and Linux is like under a percent. We just have to know where

32
0:03:26.480 --> 0:03:34.720
we are and that's where we are. In general 5.5% of all Firefox page loads for the month of January

33
0:03:34.720 --> 0:03:42.720
were had some accessible technology built in and that's not evenly distributed across the OSes. We

34
0:03:42.720 --> 0:03:51.200
see a much higher use on Windows and you know Linux isn't bad, Orca, yay! And then Mac is

35
0:03:51.200 --> 0:03:57.680
far below that but for the most part if we were talking about who is touching this work and who

36
0:03:57.680 --> 0:04:04.640
do we have to care about, it's these Windows users. And then here just for a little bit more context

37
0:04:04.640 --> 0:04:12.400
about in that 5.5% of page loads that use accessible technologies like what accessible

38
0:04:12.400 --> 0:04:21.200
technologies are they using? They're using mostly screen magnifiers which is the black line and then

39
0:04:21.920 --> 0:04:29.360
the purple line is speech rec in general and then underneath that is NVDA which is the Windows

40
0:04:29.360 --> 0:04:34.240
screen reader. So those are like the top three that we really have to care about.

41
0:04:34.240 --> 0:04:42.880
More again. Before we get into all the details about the performance work, I want to give you

42
0:04:42.880 --> 0:04:46.800
some background on how rendering works in web browsers and how it translates to

43
0:04:47.680 --> 0:04:50.240
the accessibility architecture that we're going to be talking about today.

44
0:04:51.200 --> 0:04:57.920
The general job of a web browser is to convert HTML and CSS written by web authors into visual

45
0:04:57.920 --> 0:05:04.160
navigable content. We do this through a rendering engine in Firefox called Gecko. It has five

46
0:05:04.160 --> 0:05:09.920
different phases and stages that produce artifacts that are used in the following phases and stages.

47
0:05:09.920 --> 0:05:15.120
So first we parse the HTML document. This creates the DOM or document object model which is a

48
0:05:15.120 --> 0:05:21.280
hierarchical view of the web page. Then we look at the CSS and figure out the style information for

49
0:05:21.280 --> 0:05:27.120
each node, what visual changes we need to make when we render. Then we do layout which computes

50
0:05:27.120 --> 0:05:32.320
positional and size information for each of these nodes. It also constructs an artifact with that

51
0:05:32.320 --> 0:05:38.000
information called the frame tree which becomes useful later. Then we do painting and compositing

52
0:05:38.000 --> 0:05:46.560
and rendering which is the visual part of rendering. But this process is all extremely visual, right?

53
0:05:46.560 --> 0:05:51.760
What if you do not navigate the web visually? What if you navigate it with technology like a screen

54
0:05:51.760 --> 0:05:57.600
reader which turns visual content into audio? What do you do then? How does a screen reader figure

55
0:05:57.600 --> 0:06:04.640
out what it should be telling you? That's the job of the accessibility engine. Like we have a

56
0:06:04.640 --> 0:06:08.960
rendering engine, we also have an accessibility engine in Firefox. It doesn't have a fun name.

57
0:06:08.960 --> 0:06:15.280
So if you can come up with a fun name, you should let me know on matrix. What it does is it takes

58
0:06:15.280 --> 0:06:20.240
in those artifacts we talked about before, the DOM, the frame tree, style structs, et cetera,

59
0:06:20.240 --> 0:06:25.120
and it marshals them into a new kind of tree which we call the accessibility tree or I like to call

60
0:06:25.120 --> 0:06:30.480
it the accessibility tree because that's more fun. But it takes all of those and computes

61
0:06:31.040 --> 0:06:38.000
excessively relevant information. So this is stuff like semantic, role, name, the kinds of actions you

62
0:06:38.000 --> 0:06:43.920
can perform on an element, things like that. This is not necessarily one-to-one. There's not a single

63
0:06:43.920 --> 0:06:48.640
accessible for every node in the DOM tree or a single accessible for every frame in the frame

64
0:06:48.640 --> 0:06:53.600
tree. We care about different things which is why we have to build a new structure. And building

65
0:06:53.600 --> 0:06:58.800
the structure happens in the content process. We have one accessibility tree per web page.

66
0:07:01.200 --> 0:07:07.120
So let's take a look at how these queries happen from an assistive technology standpoint. So at

67
0:07:07.120 --> 0:07:11.920
the bottom here, I've got a couple different kinds of assistive technologies. These are ones that

68
0:07:11.920 --> 0:07:16.160
Benjamin mentioned on that graph from before. So we have screen readers, voice control, window managers,

69
0:07:16.160 --> 0:07:24.960
et cetera. These clients or ATs make requests to Firefox for web content information. So if you are

70
0:07:24.960 --> 0:07:30.000
navigating with a screen reader, the screen reader needs to ask what node is focused and what should

71
0:07:30.000 --> 0:07:36.400
I say about it to the end user? The way that those requests happen are through platform-specific APIs,

72
0:07:37.040 --> 0:07:42.160
but they all hit the parent process in Firefox. The assistive technologies are separate applications.

73
0:07:42.160 --> 0:07:50.240
So they are communicating with Firefox through the parent process. Each web page lives in one or more

74
0:07:50.240 --> 0:07:55.840
other processes, one or more content processes, and is not reachable by the assistive technology

75
0:07:55.840 --> 0:08:02.240
directly. So we can't inject the screen reader into web content for a lot of reasons, security

76
0:08:02.240 --> 0:08:09.280
being one of them. All these calls go through the parent process. And there are some problems with

77
0:08:09.280 --> 0:08:14.160
this architecture that motivate what we're going to talk about next. So let's get into it.

78
0:08:15.760 --> 0:08:21.600
Like I said, computation of the relevant properties that the assistive technologies are requesting,

79
0:08:21.600 --> 0:08:28.000
that all happens using the accessibility tree in the content process. The result gets sent to the

80
0:08:28.000 --> 0:08:34.960
parent process from content via IPC, interprocess communication. This is slow and it's also

81
0:08:34.960 --> 0:08:40.640
synchronous. So if a call gets blocked or is taking a really long time in content,

82
0:08:40.640 --> 0:08:45.280
you can't do anything. The parent process just hangs. And because the parent process includes

83
0:08:45.280 --> 0:08:51.200
all of the browser UI as well, it just looks like Firefox is not responding, which isn't great.

84
0:08:51.920 --> 0:08:57.440
So what can we do about that? Well, our solution is this project we call Cache the World,

85
0:08:58.000 --> 0:09:04.480
which introduces a cache in the parent process that keeps track of snippets of content information

86
0:09:04.480 --> 0:09:10.080
that we need to compute and respond to those API calls. So we're trying to offload as much work as

87
0:09:10.080 --> 0:09:16.080
we can from content into parent. And this cache gets updated asynchronously based on content

88
0:09:16.080 --> 0:09:20.080
mutations. So we no longer have this problem of synchronous blocking IPC.

89
0:09:22.720 --> 0:09:27.840
Cool. So now I'm back and I'm going to talk a little bit about, like, how do we see if this

90
0:09:27.840 --> 0:09:34.560
stuff's working? So the first thing we did is actually not at all metric or measurement-based,

91
0:09:34.560 --> 0:09:40.000
but it was more about helping debug in the profiler. So one of my great colleagues, Michael

92
0:09:40.000 --> 0:09:45.600
Kamala, added some accessibility markers in the profiler to kind of, like, get us an idea of,

93
0:09:45.600 --> 0:09:51.920
like, what's going on where? You can see the specific calls here. And then I'm going to show

94
0:09:51.920 --> 0:09:58.720
you what it looks like kind of in the profiler. So the red circle is where we start to drop in to

95
0:09:58.720 --> 0:10:04.720
some of the accessibility calls. So watch this space, because we're going to be adding more

96
0:10:04.720 --> 0:10:09.760
markers here. The second thing we had to do is really come up with, like, how do we test

97
0:10:09.760 --> 0:10:17.840
accessibility? And what's going on here? There's a huge amount of screen reader. There's just, like,

98
0:10:17.840 --> 0:10:22.640
a whole bunch of different screen readers. And they're all different. And each OS has a different

99
0:10:22.640 --> 0:10:29.360
strategy for dealing with this. So we have, like, a huge complex testing matrix here. In addition,

100
0:10:29.360 --> 0:10:34.720
we had to, like, in terms of testing, we had to, like, run a large number of variations to kind of

101
0:10:34.720 --> 0:10:40.400
verify our results. We have five different variations starting with the baseline. And then

102
0:10:40.400 --> 0:10:48.000
we kind of, like, have caches on and off with the accessibility implicitly on by just plugging in

103
0:10:48.000 --> 0:10:52.960
screen reader. And also with accessibility forced on with preferences. So we have a really large

104
0:10:52.960 --> 0:11:01.280
matrix of five on our tasks here. And then we were looking for specific problematic web content

105
0:11:01.840 --> 0:11:07.680
that would really trigger kind of the worst case scenarios here. And they are, in general,

106
0:11:07.680 --> 0:11:15.840
the worst case web content for this are really large static web pages. So what did we do? We added

107
0:11:15.840 --> 0:11:19.600
three specific sites. Actually, I think we have, like, five sites. But in general, it's, like,

108
0:11:20.240 --> 0:11:26.640
Wikipedia World War II is a great test page for testing accessibility. We have some

109
0:11:26.640 --> 0:11:33.440
search box links because we're Firefox engineers. And then what WG HTML specs. So these kind of,

110
0:11:33.440 --> 0:11:38.160
like, really large static pages, which is not necessarily how a lot of the web is built right

111
0:11:38.160 --> 0:11:44.480
now. But these are, like, specific problem points that we wanted to be aware of and address.

112
0:11:46.160 --> 0:11:52.640
And then comes a question of, like, well, what are we measuring? What's important? And we have,

113
0:11:52.640 --> 0:12:00.000
like, three general choices here. We have, like, W3C, navigation timing, kind of page load metrics,

114
0:12:00.000 --> 0:12:06.560
like, OG performance metrics, that segment browser page load into distinct phases,

115
0:12:06.560 --> 0:12:27.060
H

116
0:12:27.060 --> 0:12:33.240
flows and time and measure. And that's really showing the most promise, frankly, and what we're

117
0:12:33.240 --> 0:12:43.080
going to be using more of in the future. Whoops. And so what we're trying to work in public,

118
0:12:43.080 --> 0:12:50.600
and we have some public dashboards for this work, which are at the end here. Whoops. Sorry.

119
0:12:50.600 --> 0:12:59.480
So this is, like, some preliminary results. This graph's a little hard to understand,

120
0:12:59.480 --> 0:13:07.920
and I'm sorry about that. We have the blue baseline performance. We have these dotted lines with the

121
0:13:07.920 --> 0:13:13.760
caches turned off. And then we have with the caches turned on. And so we're seeing, like,

122
0:13:13.760 --> 0:13:23.640
eh, not great performance for these static web pages right now, at least on Linux. I think

123
0:13:23.640 --> 0:13:30.560
that actually varies on Windows. But we're seeing some wins and some more, even performance on

124
0:13:30.560 --> 0:13:40.120
things like IMD web pages, which aren't, like, these pathological test cases. So in general,

125
0:13:40.120 --> 0:13:45.400
what we're going to be doing is we're going to be trying to align the profile markers that were put

126
0:13:45.400 --> 0:13:51.960
in to performance metrics using our internal tools at first. And we're just going to try to

127
0:13:51.960 --> 0:13:59.400
start measuring, like, the actual cache creation time. And we also want to start paying attention

128
0:13:59.400 --> 0:14:06.080
to not just straight, class-seq page load, but we want to start thinking about page reload,

129
0:14:06.080 --> 0:14:16.040
tab switching, and one of the other leads on this project, Jamie T., has a great blog post about

130
0:14:16.040 --> 0:14:21.240
those kind of, like, anecdotal performance measurements. We definitely want accessibility

131
0:14:21.240 --> 0:14:27.320
first metrics, and we would like to get away from generic page load type metrics on this.

132
0:14:27.320 --> 0:14:36.520
We have a public dashboard, work in progress. It will continue to evolve as this work evolves.

133
0:14:36.520 --> 0:14:45.320
And then really quickly, future work. Yeah, so the accessibility team at Mozilla is responsible

134
0:14:45.320 --> 0:14:49.920
for a lot more than just the accessibility engine. We're also responsible for high contrast mode,

135
0:14:49.920 --> 0:14:57.640
Zoom, Firefox front end, usability and accessibility. So we've got a lot of projects apart from this

136
0:14:57.640 --> 0:15:02.120
that we're working on, but our main goal for this half is to ship Cache the World to release. We're

137
0:15:02.120 --> 0:15:07.360
currently in beta, and we have a lot of promising results. So we're really optimistic about getting

138
0:15:07.360 --> 0:15:13.120
this to all of our users. We're also planning on working on optimizations based on the performance

139
0:15:13.120 --> 0:15:17.360
work that you're seeing here. We have a couple of optimizations in mind. Like, we know we can

140
0:15:17.360 --> 0:15:23.120
improve on cache granularity, but this work will inform the kind of work that we're doing next.

141
0:15:23.120 --> 0:15:32.600
And then performance team is going to really try to get these Windows results in since we know it's

142
0:15:32.600 --> 0:15:40.040
so important. At the same time, we want to make sure that Linux performance doesn't degrade. Also,

143
0:15:40.040 --> 0:15:45.800
we would like to kind of, like, put this into standard continuous integration tests infrastructure,

144
0:15:45.800 --> 0:15:52.600
kind of tune our markers, make sure we're measuring what we think we're measuring, and then things

145
0:15:52.600 --> 0:15:59.320
that we deem successful in a wide variety of web content. We want to try to push out to public

146
0:15:59.320 --> 0:16:08.800
telemetry so that we can actually measure much larger environments and users. And then, of course,

147
0:16:08.800 --> 0:16:15.760
all the internal collaborations inside of Mozilla with PerfTools and ETL and DevOps to try and make

148
0:16:15.760 --> 0:16:23.280
all the magic happen. We have some questions. If we have time for questions, we have time for

149
0:16:23.280 --> 0:16:29.280
questions. We have time for questions. Fantastic. And if you have other thoughts, you can email us.

150
0:16:29.280 --> 0:16:50.560
Or, you know, Twitter. And I'm on MasterCard. I'm not. Are there any questions? All right.

151
0:16:50.560 --> 0:17:07.440
So complete. Yeah. We actually, on the slide deck, but not in our presentation, we did have,

152
0:17:07.440 --> 0:17:13.040
we have some additional resources and notes for people who are trying to work with accessibility,

153
0:17:13.040 --> 0:17:22.400
maybe new to it, and things that, here's some resources for you to use. Again, Jamie's blog post,

154
0:17:22.400 --> 0:17:29.440
really, I'm going to really hype that again. Please read it. Morgan is going to put a video up. That

155
0:17:29.440 --> 0:17:35.720
has to be redone because there is some internal stuff that can't be shown. But there's a great,

156
0:17:35.720 --> 0:17:42.720
she has a great walkthrough about how to debug CSS for accessibility. And then I have a web page on

157
0:17:42.720 --> 0:17:50.960
color and contrast for accessibility and how you can compute colors at work for a wide variety of

158
0:17:50.960 --> 0:17:58.680
people. And also I want to shamelessly plug that you can contribute to Firefox. Oh, yeah. And if

159
0:17:58.680 --> 0:18:05.440
you are interested in working on platform specific bugs or front end bugs or whatever,

160
0:18:05.440 --> 0:18:09.720
accessibility is a great place to get involved because we span a lot of components and we could

161
0:18:09.720 --> 0:18:15.000
always use your help. So if you are interested, we have an accessibility room on matrix at the

162
0:18:15.000 --> 0:18:23.040
Mozilla domain. And you should reach out. And we're there. So. Thin. Yeah. Oh, great. We'll take a

163
0:18:23.040 --> 0:18:29.240
question. Hi. So you mentioned it's not safe to embed the screen reader directly into the web

164
0:18:29.240 --> 0:18:34.080
page because of security concerns. But now with caching, you're providing a little bit more

165
0:18:34.080 --> 0:18:40.080
information to this parent process. Are there any security considerations you have to look at or

166
0:18:40.080 --> 0:18:45.720
address doing this work? We're paying attention to the kind of information that we're caching. We,

167
0:18:45.720 --> 0:18:50.120
of course, don't want to give any private user information away. Largely the information we're

168
0:18:50.120 --> 0:18:55.440
caching is already represented in the parent process in some form. But the way that we compute

169
0:18:55.440 --> 0:19:01.560
things is different than how DOM or layout or other parts of the browser compute them. We're

170
0:19:01.560 --> 0:19:10.080
caching really, really granular information as well. So, yeah. We're not currently concerned

171
0:19:10.080 --> 0:19:27.040
about security risk. But that is a consideration. Oh, cool. Yeah, that's what that website is. Oh,

172
0:19:27.040 --> 0:19:32.440
sorry. Do we have tests with accessibility? Are we performance testing for accessibility? Yes,

173
0:19:32.440 --> 0:19:47.880
we're starting to do that. And. Yeah. So we're. Okay. So the question is like how, like what's,

174
0:19:47.880 --> 0:19:52.840
what's the method there? And you can contact me offline if we, if we're running close. But we're

175
0:19:52.840 --> 0:19:58.480
using a standard framework for performance testing called browser time, which is open source. And,

176
0:19:58.480 --> 0:20:05.920
yes, what we're doing is we have OS specific handlers that basically start screen readers

177
0:20:05.920 --> 0:20:11.720
before we start running that and then stop it when we're done. So it's just RAI, straight style on

178
0:20:11.720 --> 0:20:18.880
that. Yeah. And then pointing that to Windows too. One of the difficulties with that approach that

179
0:20:18.880 --> 0:20:23.120
we're running into is that we are most interested in perceived performance. So we want to know how

180
0:20:23.120 --> 0:20:29.200
does the user feel about this? Like is it perceivably faster? And that's really hard to do because

181
0:20:29.200 --> 0:20:34.840
screen readers are difficult to automate from that perspective. Speech rate is extremely variable.

182
0:20:34.840 --> 0:20:40.400
Right. You can, you know, do key presses and stuff, but it's really hard to get the kinds of

183
0:20:40.400 --> 0:20:44.080
measurements we want. So we're aware that the performance testing we're doing right now is

184
0:20:44.080 --> 0:20:48.800
a number and it's something that we can track consistently, but it isn't entirely what we would

185
0:20:48.800 --> 0:20:53.200
like to be. And there's different strategies on the Windows screen readers about like having to

186
0:20:53.200 --> 0:21:00.680
have the full page ready before we actually start, start in with the speech. And that's not, that's

187
0:21:00.680 --> 0:21:06.400
like configurable and that's not the default setting for, on Linux for instance. So Orca, I think,

188
0:21:06.400 --> 0:21:11.280
is actually pretty smart about this. And they, they can do partial, partial reads and start the

189
0:21:11.280 --> 0:21:22.560
speech earlier. So, so we're not getting quite sure. Note that the caching of the parent moves

190
0:21:22.560 --> 0:21:31.640
information into a process that is not exposed to web content. There's nothing before that.

191
0:21:31.640 --> 0:21:41.760
It's not appearing here. Maybe. Yes. Yeah. Oh, can you talk about how the cache is populated

192
0:21:41.760 --> 0:21:56.080
and invalidated? Oh, sure. How much time do we have? So the cache is populated from content. So

193
0:21:56.080 --> 0:22:00.800
it's a push based cache. We aren't invalidating from parent because we can't observe content

194
0:22:00.800 --> 0:22:05.560
mutations from parent effectively. Each content process is responsible for monitoring their own

195
0:22:05.560 --> 0:22:11.640
mutations and pushing or invalidating stuff in the parent process as needed. We have an initial

196
0:22:11.640 --> 0:22:20.920
cache push that, oh no, sorry. On, on page load we collect a bunch of information and push it

197
0:22:20.920 --> 0:22:26.160
always. So there isn't any sort of mutation that we're responding to there. That is one of our big

198
0:22:26.160 --> 0:22:30.960
performance concerns is the initial cache push varies by page size or scales by page size. And

199
0:22:30.960 --> 0:22:37.320
that's really costly. But that's why you put all those big tests. Yeah. Yeah. But from, from

200
0:22:37.320 --> 0:22:46.440
initial cache push onward, we're responding to mutations in content from content. Are there any

201
0:22:46.440 --> 0:23:01.680
other questions? Yeah, go into the limit. On the web app side, what may impact negatively the

202
0:23:01.680 --> 0:23:09.320
performance of the accessibility? Like how could you design web content such that it's, it's optimal

203
0:23:09.320 --> 0:23:19.000
for accessibility? That's a great question. And we'll come back at you later with an answer. Yeah,

204
0:23:19.000 --> 0:23:22.920
we're still, we're still like kind of early in phase on this, but I feel it would be a great idea

205
0:23:22.920 --> 0:23:29.840
to do some kind of like web content help to get people to know like the performance choices are

206
0:23:29.840 --> 0:23:38.920
making for accessibility. Oh yeah. Performa, could we come up with some guidelines for

207
0:23:38.920 --> 0:23:45.360
performance linting and general guidelines for how to do perform an accessibility request submitted.

208
0:23:45.360 --> 0:24:10.320
Thank you. So thank you very much. We are done.
